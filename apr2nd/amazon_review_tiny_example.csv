"I wanted to try out this product for the ""skin/hair care"" side of it, though this product is ""pure"" enough that a little in my soup or skillet creates a nice  nutty aroma and mild taste - really good in this coconut curry soup I eat.That said, I brought the jar into my bathroom to keep it there instead of for cooking (I'll purchase another one for the kitchen). The one negative I have with this product for skin is that it's so thick and hard, I really have to dig in there to get a bit; however, once it's in the palm of my hand, the warmth of my skin melts it quite quickly. It can feel a little heavy and greasy at first, and the scent of coconut makes me think of cooking and not ""beauty product;"" but I mixed it with a little of my regular hand/body lotion and that was the ticket - it smoothed on my skin quite nicely and created a kind of ""sheen"" like those starlets have on their skin as they walk the red carpet with an insipid grin. Mixing it toned down the coconut scent, too.I did smooth it on my face, straight, and it did absorb quickly, and the scent of coconuts wasn't so strong after a few minutes. I have slightly sensitive skin with a little rosacea and the product didn't break me out or irritate my skin.But! The best ""beauty"" use I had from this product that SOLD me, is what it did to my hair! One morning I smoothed the coconut oil on my hair, paying particular attention to the ends. I threw my hair up in a ponytail and left the coconut oil in for at least an hour and a half. I rinsed it out with very warm water and then I shampooed twice. When I stepped out of the shower, I realized I was going to be late for an appointment. I quickly combed my hair, dressed, jumped into my car, and let the opened windows dry my hair, every so often shaking it out and combing through with my fingers -- I couldn't believe it! by time I reached my appt 35 minutes away, my hair was soft and smooth -  even with the wind hitting it - no blow-dryer - no brushing it out - when I returned from the appt - again the windows open blowing my hair all over creation, I brushed my hair and it was so soft and shiny and smooth. That sold me -- if I don't use this product for anything else, it's worth it for how it made my hair look and feel!UPDATE! - I bought another container of this to use in the kitchen - omg! If you saute shrimp in it, you not only have the aroma of coconut, but the shrimp taste incredible! I also fry or scramble eggs with it - mmmmmm - this stuff is amazing.",5
"I ordered this to use as a moisturizer on my face as my skin is very sensitive. I was looking for a natural and inexpensive product and this sounded like a good thing to try. I have been very happy with it. I mix a small bit with some 100% Pure Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz and put it on my face after showering.It feels wonderful and leaves my skin feeling smooth all day. I use to have very dry skin and would break out with the worst case of acne almost on a weekly occurrence. The almond and coconut oil have been amazing. There are ton of other uses for them as well.I use the coconut oil in the shower sometimes too. It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and leaves my hair conditioned and moisturized without any buildup. It rinses very easily and gives my hair that extra bounce. I will keep looking for more uses for these oils, I could go on forever how great they are but I won't! Instead I'll just say for what I've used them for so far, they've been just great!",5
"I use a lot of extra virgin coconut oil, so much that I usually buy the Nutiva 2-pack of 54-ounce jars. I tried Vitacost's and didn't like it as much as Nutiva, so I've stuck with the Nutiva and really had not planned to switch brands. When I was offered the opportunity to review the Viva Labs product, I agreed but was doubtful I was going to be swayed.Well, let me tell you, when I opened up this coconut oil, I was amazed at the difference. This is an extra virgin coconut oil I could actually imagine myself taking by the tablespoonful, as was recommended by several health books my sister shared with me for people suffering from candida albicans infections. I've used my Nutiva for popping popcorn, cooking, and for skin care, but now I'm thinking I'll just use up the Nutiva for frying and go straight for the Viva Labs version for everything else. There's just no contest.A great use for this coconut oil is as a butter replacement on toast. My Nutiva spreads and melts like one of those margarines that take a long time to melt; the Viva Labs spreads like softened butter and melts like a dream.Price-wise, I've been spending about 47 cents an ounce for the Nutiva when I buy it in the big bulk pack. I was thinking that, at almost 62 cents an ounce for the 15-ounce container, the Viva Labs was more expensivealthough I'd have to say it's worth it. But when I went to cost out some of the other Nutiva products, they ran as much per ounce if not more than the Viva Labs product.I'm impressed enough that I'll be switching.",5
"Viva Labs' Coconut Oil was offered to me free for review and I loved it!  It comes in a plastic jar and can be a liquid or a solid depending on the temperature of your home.  When I received it, it was a liquid, so I put a little in a squirt bottle (for the shower - see below), but the next day it was a solid because of the temperature inside my home - I just ran the bottle under some warm water and it quickly liquefied so I could squeeze it out.After receiving my Viva Labs' Coconut Oil, I ventured out onto the web to see what I could use it for and wow!  There are loads of different ways to use coconut oil:* Cooking* Baking* Skin Care* Hair Care* Aromatherapy* Kitty Cats (put it on their paws to reduce hairballs and promote a shiny coat)* Google it and I am certain you will find a million ways to use it!So, how did I use it?In the kitchen:  I was thinking that it would only be good in dishes that were sweet, but it doesn't have a sweet taste at all.  I actually fried an egg with it and I couldn't tell that I didn't use regular oil.  Coconut oil has a high smoke point, so frying an egg was totally fool-proof and I did notice that it didn't spatter all over the stove like vegetable oil does and my favorite thing about it was that my kitchen didn't smell like fried food for days - which is one of the main reasons I never fry anything!Shower: I always use baby oil (while my skin is wet) as a moisturizer, so instead of my baby oil, I switched it up and started using the coconut oil.  A little bit goes a long way, but it soaks into the skin quite nicely and left me feeling silky smooth with no greasy feeling and it smells delicious!Makeup Remover:  I also use baby oil to remove my waterproof mascara, so I used the coconut oil and it worked like a charm!Exfoliator:  I also used it as an exfoliator on my hands, feet and body - mix it with a little sugar while you are in the shower.  It is an inexpensive way to get rid of that dry and flaky skin and again...  leaves you with silky smooth skin.I saw that you could use it as a deep conditioning treatment on your hair - it works there too - I smoothed A LITTLE on my hair and left it overnight and then washed it out in the morning.  My hair was nice and shiny and didn't look greasy at all.  My hair is super short, but I could imagine that a person who might really notice a difference would be someone with long hair who battles with their hair being dry and or frizzy would really notice a difference.Finally, you can use it as a sexual lubricant - yes, well, you know!  It wouldn't be a ""Bookie Nookie"" review if I didn't bring something naughty into it!  There is ZERO sugar in coconut oil - which is a common concern when using ""food"" products that are sweet in or around those girly parts (sugar in THAT area can cause a yeast infection o_O).  There were no issues with that and definitely reduced the friction and helped things glide quite nicely :-DViva Labs' Coconut Oil is definitely a product I would use again and I would and have recommended it to my friends.  At around 11 bucks for a 16-ounce jar, it's affordable and has a million uses - you have nothing to lose by checking it out. Product provided by Viva Labs for an honest review.",5
"I love this product!  I tried a few different brands of coconut oil, for beauty purposes, and this has, by far, shown the best results.  It is also the best price I have found both online and in stores.",5
I use this in my coffee because of the health benefits associated with mct oil. It also tastes great and is usefull for your hair and skin as well.,5
"I was asked to review this Coconut Oil and as a regular user who keeps a jar at the bedside I can happily give it five stars. I use it for beauty and moisturization more than cooking so my review will focus on that.This oil is light, non sticky, and moisturizes beautifully. The scent is natural coconut. Pleasant and not overwhelming.",5
"So far so good. I bought this because I wanted to start oil pulling. It's been working great. Great taste (while swishing it around and NOT swallowing it). Put some on my arm that was very dry. It helped. Haven't cooked with it yet, but I'm sure it will be great!",5
"This is amazing, especially from this company in particular. So far it's healed my dry/cracked hands in two days, my daughters diaper rash over night (and I've completely replaced all her body lotions with it-she's so much softer and happier), my face is completely blemish/acne free after using it for 4 days, and it soothed and worked as a great antibacterial ointment for my husbands cuts and scrapes from work. Just a little dab goes a super long way and this container will last me for a good month - even when using it every day! I am so satisfied that Viva Labs now has a new customer for life!",5
"I liked this coconut oil very much, but I like ""nutiva"" brand better. It has a fresher aroma. I use this to moisturize my skin.",4
"In the last few months, I've reviewed two books that touted the value of coconut oil and its many uses. When I searched for ""coconut oil"" in Amazon books, I got several thousand hits. It's definitely a hot topic these days, yet I can remember when the consumption of coconut oil was widely disparaged because of its saturated fat. Fast forward a few decades, and although some health authorities still don't like coconut oil, the tide has turned and the oil is being praised for its many benefits, both internal and external.The Viva Labs product is ""extra virgin."" Since it hasn't been refined or heavily processed, it has a very mild coconut taste and aroma, both of which were very pleasant to my palate and nose. The melting temperature is about 76 F, so at most room temperatures, the oil has a soft creamy texture. I tried a spoonful, and it's quite tasty. I then fried some breaded shrimp in the oil, and it was delicious. I'm looking forward to substituting coconut oil for olive or canola oil in some of the recipes my wife and I use.Healthwise, because much of the saturated fat of extra virgin coconut oil is in the form of lauric acid, coconut oil is considered to be a better alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils when solid fats are required. In addition, virgin coconut oil is composed mainly of medium-chain triglycerides (aka ""healthy fats""), which may not carry the same risks as other saturated fats. Recent findings indicate that daily consumption of coconut oil may boost brain performance and could even help to prevent Alzheimer's.The two books on coconut oil that I reviewed also mentioned the external uses of the product for improving skin moisture and appearance, and for aromatherapy and massage therapy. It can even be used as a restorative treatment on hair.Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today, and my experience with the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has been very positive.",5
"It tastes like the inside of a chocolate covered coconut candy, but better. I bought it initially for oil pulling, but I am going to use it for better things, so it is not wasted. I liked oil pulling, but I hate wasting the oil that way. It is very high quality, tasty stuff! They say you should consume up to 3 teaspoons of it a day. Very excellent quality stuff here :)",5
In love with this stuff. It's the real things. Smells amazing. Tastes amazing. Always helps my baby's rashes from his diaper. I use it for everything. Love love love.,5
"It's great, doesn't have the heavy coconut smell. I put in on toast, my daughter puts in on her body. We both love the product. It does last a long time. (the jar!)",4
"I love this stuff. It's like i'm moisturizing myself with water, it rubs in so easily and i see a significant depression in the noticeability of blemishes and stretch marks after just a week of using it every other day. A MUST BUY!",5
"I have just discovered coconut oil and I definitely love it! I have used it as pre-shampoo mask (it takes time and it's a little bit messy to have oil in your hair, but it's worth it) and as make-up remover. It works perfectly, even with waterproof mascara. It's great not having to use aggressive and chemicals-loaded products to remove make-up. I am also using it on my feet, which are super dry. Overall, great product, (and fantastic smell).",5
"I ordered Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil for a dry skin problem. I had been to Aruba for 11 days and my skin suffered as a result. My legs,especially,were very dry and flaky. On the recommendation of a relative,I tried this product. I noticed a dramatic difference in 2 days. I intend using it for my hair also as I am so pleased with the results on my legs.",5
You can bake and cook with it or rub it on those dry elbows. Slight smell of coconut and is creamy to the touch. I keep sneaking into the kitchen and grabbing a spoon full to munch on. And it's healthy! I'm going to use it in my next chocolate recipe.,5
"I received a free sample of coconut oil from Viva Labs in exchange for my honest review, and I'm pleased to say I'm highly impressed. In comparison to the brand of coconut oil I typically buy, the Viva Labs brand has a faint but noticeable aroma of coconut.The consistency is creamy and when rubbed onto the skin, it dissolves instantly and absorbs without leaving a greasy residue. I rubbed some on a laceration on my leg and the coconut oil relieved the itching and left the skin noticeable softer and smoother.I used it in baking and frying with excellent results. My family gobbled up the biscuits and fried potatoes, and the only comment they made was that the fried potatoes had just a hint of coconut flavor. However, everyone agreed it was an intriguing flavor twist.Our favorite experiment with using the oil was to pop some organic popcorn. We all agreed the coconut oil added a little extra flavor to the corn, and I ended up popping two batches because everyone wanted more.I am not going to discuss price point comparisons because to me other considerations are more important than price. For my family, I'm willing to pay a few cents more to get an organic product that is packaged in a BPA free container and certified by the NON GMO Project as a pure food. It's also important to me for the oils I use to be extra-virgin, cold pressed and unrefined so Viva Labs Coconut Oil is the perfect match for my household needs.I'd recommend this product to anyone who is concerned about the increasing proliferation of genetically modified organisms being introduced into our food supply and looking for a healthier option.Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this Coconut Oil free  book free from Viva Labs in exchange for a product review. I was not required to  write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.""",5
"I use this for oil pulling, and moisturizing my hair and skin. This is such a great product. I'd recommend it for anyone who has really troublesome, dry skin. I have eczema and putting a thin layer of this coconut oil on my face before bed has done wonders, not to mention the lovely scent of fresh coconut! Will definitely be buying this again.",5
"I  bought this to try the latest trend... oil pulling.  I travel a lot for work, so haven't gotten to try it for that much (because I'm not going to take it with me!), but I have done it a couple times.  I have also used for deep hair conditioning (make sure to shampoo your hair at least twice!), body moisturizing, and plan to use for cooking.  I haven't tried any other brands, but I do like this one.  Very versatile product, and fast shipping.",5
"Great quality coconut oil. I don't use it for cooking but I use it for just about everything else. I put a tablespoon in my coffee to help burn belly fat (this really works when used in conjunction with exercise and a healthy diet of course). I use it as a toothpaste, a moisturizer, diaper rash cream. It's fabulous.This brand in particular has nice mild coconutty flavor and I love that the jar has a wide mouth and is easy to scoop out the oil. The jar is plastic however which is my only issue with it but I will continue to order it.",5
"This is my first experience with coconut oil. I bought this to make popcorn in a stovetop popper (eliminated microwave popcorn as part of my ""clean eating"" initiative). I tried making the popcorn with other oils and/or butter, and hands down the coconut oil is the best for this. No coconutty taste either.",5
"I ordered this coconut oil because I saw this product have almost 5 star with 700 above reviewer to wrote the review, so I curious about this product, and suspect is it that good?! After I received the product, I opened it, and have coconut smell that not too strong,like a nature coconut smell that would not make you feel sick. I also like the texture too, it is not too light, but not too thickness,  the texture is a little bit thicker than all of coconut oil I bought before. I must admitted that this coconut oil is more moisturise that other coconut oil I bought. I usually use this oil and organic extra virgin olive oil mix together, to put on the body before going to shower. I like taking shower with hot hot water, so if I put oil before shower, it can protect my skin, and not too dry that prevent to cause pityriasis. It is really important!!! People who have pityriasis, might thought that is because gene or inheritance,I think it is not true! My mother,father, and sister did not have that problem but me(So sad>.<)! I had pityriasis one time before, I realized that was because the body lack of oil and moisturise, and actually that is the signal, the body is telling you,"" I feel sick, please give me water and oil"". So just like we are human being need oxygen and water!.Using oil before shower actually not just prevent have skin problem, but also a tips for you guys that it can treat as massage, and relax the body. Most importantly, after shower, you wont feel dry!",5
"I live in MN...so when the mailman dropped this off, it was frozen. I was eager to use it, but couldn't. But the smell of it is out of this world!Once I was able to use this product, I used it in my hair as an over night mask. It added shine and vibrancy  to my hair instantly.I've used it on my feet as well, and not sure where I've been, but this product is well worth your money.I don't use it for cooking, but strictly for bathroom (hair, skin, etc.) use.",5
I bought this product as recommended by my gynecologist for post menopausal symptoms as related to intimacy.  It was everything they said and more.  I would highly recommend it!!,5
"Wonderful coconut oil! Great quality, I love using it on my biracial daughters hair...I put it in after its wet and comb through and it helps combat frizz for days. I also put in a Tbsp in my hot tea for added health kick...also a great skin moisturizer....so many wonderful uses and impressed with the brand, just as good if not better then Natures Way...",5
Product is really good and doesn't make skin or hair oily. I would recommend this product and it is Organic.,4
CoffeePork ChopsVeggiesCorn BreadDid I mention Coffee? I literally JUST drink coffee with this coconut oil. bomb.com/bombdotcomWEWT!,5
"This is non-GMO and organic.  I look for both of those in coconut oil (in most of our food actually). But this is also a very high quality product at a great price.  It is so white and smells very fresh.  I use coconut oil in a lot of my cooking and ALWAYS when popping corn...if you haven't used coconut oil to pop corn, try it.  Movie theaters have always used it, but I am pretty sure they don't use high quality oil like this.  It makes the BEST popcorn plus ads very healthy short chain fatty acids to your diet.  I also use it on my skin and on my hair occasionally.  We use a LOT of coconut oil in this house.I've tried many brands, including Nutiva and the bucket of organic that Costco sells.  This is at least as good as the best we've used and will definitely be using this product again.  As I said  the price is great for a product of this quality.",5
"I've tried other brands of coconut oil that I like better (e.g., Living Foods), as Viva tends to dry out too quickly. This brand works well enough, especially when you compare it to other types of moisturizers.My usage: I regularly use unrefined coconut oil as a skin and hair moisturizer. In the winter, I like to spread a thin layer over my face, followed by a few min under a steamy washcloth. If I rinse out the washcloth and use it to wipe off the oil, it doesn't clog my pores and I feel moisturized all day.",3
This is the best moisturizing oil I have ever tried and now stick with it. I can guarantee 100% it really makes your skin super moist and unlike other products or lotion where you need to reapply cause it dries. This is the best so far and when I use it my skin stays soft and moist for 2 days. This works great on cracked feet or dry elbows or knees. After trying this oil I threw away all of my moisturizing lotions away they just can't compare with coconut oil. Yes and I suggest you do the same :) I recommend this for everyone. Love the coconut scent. Coconut oil and me are friends forever! Organic products are the best!,5
Smells great.. I use as a moisturizer after I get out of the shower every day. It makes my skin so smooth and you can't beat the price!,5
"The product seems to do a great job at softening my natural hair (my hair doesn't have a consistent curl pattern, but I think it's somewhere in the 3c-4a range? who knows...). And it could just be me, but coconut oil also seems to make my usually fragile strands more elastic and thus less prone to breakage (if that makes any sense).For me, coconut oil works best when worked into natural hair that has been slightly ""dampened"" with water or a water-based product (like conditioner), and then bunned or banded for several hours (like overnight). When I let my hair down, it's as soft as a baby's...skin. I apply the product either as a solid (body heat melts it), or as a liquid (melted in the microwave). btw, I also use the coconut oil for pre-poos, hot oil treatments, scalp massages, or simply sealing moisture in my hair.Needless to say, I really like the product. It's versatility and the effectiveness that it seems to have on my natural was enough to make me want to buy it again. Just to give an estimate, a 16 oz container lasts me about a 1 1/2 months when I use a LOT (I have short-medium hair).The only con, if it is a con, is that this product will stiffen and return to its solid form when exposed to the cold (I don't know the exact temperature). But I thought it was hilarious when my hair stiffened in place during one frigid day in western NY. But don't worry, my hair quickly returned to its soft state as soon as I walked indoors. haha.",5
"I ordered this for me to jump on the oil-pulling bandwagon and give it a go, quite expecting to gag on it and shove it at the back of a cupboard to never see the light of day again.However its proving to be extremely versatile and a great product. The oil-pulling isnt as gross as I was expecting, just the first couple of minutes whilst it dissolves is the hardest. It is early days yet but my mouth and teeth do feel cleaner so I will keep on with it until my next dental check-up and see what my dentist thinks.What I am loving the most about this product is what it is doing for my skin and hair. As a hair masque it is better than anything else Ive used in the past. My hair is shiny, bouncy and very soft. It also makes a great serum for fly-aways and shine. I also like the way it feels on my elbows, knees, hands and lips and it looks like it is clearing up a spot of psoriasis I have on my leg.I will be buying more when this tub is empty and have recommended it to my friends.",5
"It is an amazing product. it works wonders and smells good too. I use it to cook with, condition my hair, and as a body lotion. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.  I even use it on my hubby dry rough feet and what a difference.",5
"I'm happy with this purchase. The coconut oil is very light, and not very dense and greasy as other brands. Also the smell is very subtle. My problem with other coconut oils were the smell was too strong.So yea this is good for both cooking or personal use on the body.",4
Very tasty and a great alternative to butter. Melts very easily if cooking on the stovetop. I tried it with fried eggs yesterday and it tasted great. Very satisfied with this product.,4
I bought this to try oil pulling and it works fine for that. I don't like coconut flavoring very much so was pleasantly surprised to find that it has a very light taste of coconut.,4
"I have tried a bunch of different types of lotions to help with my dry hands and legs.  Problem solved.  I have been using it twice a day for a couple of weeks now and can see great results.  Skin is smoother and doesn't have a dry appearance.  The best part it is not oily.  It goes on as oil but gets absorbed relatively soon and you are left with smooth, silky skin but not oily.",5
"Bought this to use a a body oil for my dry skin. So far, it's been lovely! Got my husband to try it too and we both saw immediate difference after a hot shower. Really helps keep skin moisturized. Last night, I got too lazy to apply the oil, and an hour after my shower, I was itchy from dryness. Makes a difference! The only cumbersome part is having to melt down the oil to liquid with a lighter. But, for good skin - don't be lazy :p",4
"I am very impressed with this product , i use it to take my make up off and it's amazing how well it works. I also use it on my body and i love everybout it , smells like i just ipened up a coconut. Happy i found it .Mary",5
"I have tried a couple of organic coconut oil, but this one is my favorite.  It has the best flavor and smell.  Very strong coconut flavor and smell.",5
"I bought Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil because I had read a article that Kristie Alley liked this for makeup remover and in another article Jillian Michaels loves it for her skin.  And they were right.  IT IS PERFECT.  I have dry skin and this stuff is amazing, forget using it in cooking, you need to be using this for your skin.",5
I bought this stuff at the beginning of the month to make my own lotion with cocoa butter and shea butter. I also use it on my feet and it makes my feet feel soft. Thank you.,5
"I really love this tub, it's filled to the brim with great quality organic extra virgin coconut oil and it smells divine by the way. Fragrance wise it shouldn't be confused with fresh juicy coconut as this is slightly smoky,  the oil has a delicate toffee like caramel coco tone that only lingers for a bit and doesn't clash with perfume, if anything those lipids will give it extra staying power. When the weather cools this solidifies but I just scoop it out and honestly this rarely leaves my bathroom. My favorite way of using it is after a shower or a bath, a nice thin layer of this oil scooped out and smoothed between the hands all over, it makes for the most luxurious skin treatment that leaves me feeling very relaxed, it's great in the morning if I'm not in a rush, it might take few minutes to skin in but it's especially wonderful at night. After using it I ooze into my bed and sleep deliciously, it's very soothing and spa like, my muscles always feel warm and pampered and it makes for the softest skin, even pricier creams don't work this well, I guess it's the nature and not chemical processes doing all the hard work.This is definitely edible, I know that I tend to use it more as a beauty treatment but many people take coconut oil as a supplement as well , I have cooked curries with it; Thai and Indian types, very tasty but not to be over heated as it can separate. For some reason the Viva labs brand feels better on my skin and hair, I have used the Nature's Way brand and it was good but this feel superior when used on the skin, something about it if beyond soothing and leaves the skin extra smooth, I'm going through a very hard cold winter in NY now and I use this oil in the am and pm after showering, my skin feels beyond soft, a real saver in bad weather when lotions aren't enough. This oil also makes for the best hair treatment, rub some in for a few hours and then shampoo out for the glossiest locks.- Kasia S.",5
I bought this coconut oil and honestly did not know what I was buying.  My friend told me that I could use it for several things so since I shop at Amazon and had a gift certificate I looked and chose this one.I use this for my very dry skin and all I can say is after a week of using it I am hooked.  I won't try any other coconut oil because I like this one and I say why mess with something that isn't broke!!!  I will buy again!!!,5
"Wow. I honestly have used more than half the jar in a little over a week. I use it on toast and in my coffee in the morning. And as a face wash, moisturizer and shaving cream in the shower. I have really sensitive skin and this has really helped especially during the cold, dry winter. I'll be buying another jar soon.",5
I love this coconut oil. Smells great and can be used for many things. I use it as moisturizer once a week after a hot bath and leaves my skin unbelievably smooth. I also use it on my hair by massaging it into my scalp/hair and leaving overnight. When I shower and do my hair the next day my hair feels and looks very smooth. This product can also be used on eyelashes to make them healthier and some even say it helps them grow.,5
"Love this for dry skin on cold winter months in Vermont. Smells wonderful, natural not fake.  You only need a small amount in your hair to make a difference.",5
"I'm always looking for a great coconut oil. Look no further! This oil is everything you want! Flavor...Yummm!!!Cooks up perfectly! Melts, ohhhh it melts..just the way you want it.You can not go wrong with this product!",5
"It melts quickly in your hand, spreads very easily and soaks in quickly. I will most certainly buy this product again.",5
I honestly wasn't expecting anything and I was very impressed with this product.  I use this product for my skin and I was very satisfied with my choice!,5
Great product. It smells fantastic and it's very hydrating for the skin. Great price for organic coconut oil and it arrived on time.,5
"Using mostly for my body to soften skin and treat my hair. It works wonderfully! I don't plan to use it for cooking but enjoy it for body care. Who doesn't want soft skin?My husband is also using it in his beard to control it and stimulate growth, he loves it.",5
"This is a MUST, it makes everything taste good I use it to pan fry my fish and it is sooooo GOOD! You can't go wront with this one I LOVE IT!!!",5
"Very light coconut flavor, and works great as a replacement for cooking on the stove, or adding into baked goods!  Good cost and fast shipping too!",5
Cooks well with all foods I tried.  I love the health benefits of it and there is no coconut taste.,5
"I recently discovered the value of coconut oil, and found this product.  I am quite pleased with my purchase and plan to use this product regularly for skincare.",4
I've been using it since I got it. I used it every night after shower . it's really good for the skin!!!!,5
I bought it to relieve my dogs itching from allergies. It works great!  And she loves it! Plus fur is silky soft!,5
This stuff is great. Melts in your hand to create a liquid that doesn't leave any residue/stickiness. Great skin product,5
"I have tried other coconut oils and this product by far is superior.  I have used it in cooking, on my skin just to name a few.  Highly recommended!",5
I received this product quickly and it works great!! My hair is shinier and healthier! It has helped my hair grow! Definitely recommend this!,5
"This one jar goes a long, long way. And it's a delicacy. It's subtly nutty with a clean finish and then something sublime yet haunting. Try it - just a teaspoon will excite the senses.I've never tried anything like this. In a dreamy way it feels in the system like the essence of a tropical island. This is good for the skin. In moderate doses it's very healthy. Extra virgin coconut oil has some beneficial fat that should be taken in moderation. Moderation probably means not more than three tablespoons a day, although I cannot imagine ingesting that much since it is so, so dense.I don't recommend this for cooking even though it can take much higher temperatures than olive oil before degrading. I think it's just perfect all by itself. However, I suppose I'd find more uses for it if I allowed myself this luxury more often.I received a complimentary sample and provided my honest review.",5
"After hearing about the benefits of coconut oil, I decided to give it a try.  I was mostly looking for help in curbing my desire to snack so I could lose weight.  The cost is reasonable so it was worth the risk if it failed.  Well to my surprise, I noticed a difference right away.  The very first day that I used it I noticed a big reduction in my urge to snack and desire of sweets.  I've been using it now for nearly 2 weeks and I've lost 7 lbs so far.  I am on a low carb - high protein diet as well.  I take one teaspoon every morning by itself before eating breakfast.  Some people have recommended cooking with it, mixing it with coffee/tea, peanut butter, chocolate, etc., but it's just easier for me to do it by itself.  I don't know how long it will continue working or what other benefits I might be gaining by its use.  It's too early to tell.  I will be continuing to use it and purchase more when needed and would recommend it to others.",5
"I am new to using Coconut Oil.  I primarily wanted it for my daughter who has a rare disorder and very dry skin.  It is wonderful for her lips, scalp and dry skin.  I love that it goes on like oil but does not stay oily or messy.  I have yet to use it in my cooking but look forward to trying.  I also love that it is organic.  Good stuff!",5
"After reading of all of the wonders of coconut oil on Pinterest, I finally broke down and bought some.  My main purpose of buying it was to use as a hair mask.  I have highlights, which have caused damage to my ends and bangs.  I put a couple of tablespoons on the ends of my hair (while dry) and let it sit for an hour or so, then shampooed as normal.  My hair felt so soft and amazing afterwords!  By the way- I'm also a hair stylist.  This stuff works better than any of the deep conditioners that I've purchased (and I've tried a ton of them!)I've only had my coconut oil for about a week, and I've already used it as a deep conditioner, eye makeup remover, face moisturizer, body moisturizer, lip balm, and to cook my eggs.  I can't wait to discover more uses for it!  Another plus- it smells like a vacation in a jar!",5
"I use this coconut oil for my baby's diaper area and also his body. It has helped in preventing diaper rashes and dry skin on his body. Our family uses only this coconut oil as a moisturizing lotion. It is natural, organic and well packaged.",5
"I keep the jar in our bathroom and use it everyday.  I use it when shaving my legs instead of shaving cream, as an after shower moisturizer, and as a deep conditioner for my hair.  I'll put it on my dry hair and leave it on for a few hours.  Rinse it out and shampoo twice to get all of the coconut oil out.  My husband also uses it when he shaves his face.  This one container of coconut oil has replaced many items.  We are hooked!!",5
"I used coconut oil for years as a massage therapist because it felt good on skin and didn't stain sheets like some other oils.  A few years ago my daughter-in-law touted coconut oil for use in cooking and I did try it thought often forgot in lieu of more familiar oils.  I now use Viva Labs coconut oil daily.  I put a Tbsp or two in the bottom of my blender when making green health smoothies and use what is left on the spoon directly on my arthritic knees (a little bit melts into the skin with just a rub so it doesn't need to be melted until you are using it for a whole body massage).  I use it in baking and in stove-topcooking at high temperatures.  I like the size and shape (3.5"" high and 3.5"" diameter) of the PBA free, recyclable container and it has a subtle but pleasant smell. As a side note,  there is a growing body of anecdotal information (mostly from the UK) about coconut oil helping to reverse dementia.  I will purchase Viva Labs brand coconut oil from now on!",5
"My wife wasn't keen on the idea of using the same product on both our skin and inside our stomachs. So we used it mainly as a type of lotion. I have a chronic dry spot on my elbow, and found this coconut oil did a pretty good job of keeping it moist. There is a coconutty smell that comes when applied to skin, but to me it's not unpleasant (and doesn't last too long). The only problem we came across was with our dog. Having left the jar on a living room table, he got into it and ate nearly half. Since we leave our other lotions laying around, it didn't occur to us that this would be an problem (now we know for sure that it is edible). However, because my dog consumed so much, he got sick and puked it up for several days. Not to mention he lay around looking miserable. So we put the coconut oil in our bedroom, high up on a dresser. Well, a few weeks later, somehow the dog got on the dresser and finished the rest of it off. As if he didn't learn his lesson the first time?So, be sure to keep the oil well locked away from your pets; they see it as food. As for my usage, I think it worked fine as a lotion.",5
"Certified Organic Viva Labs Coconut oil is a great choice for coconut oil. Actually, the cost is only a few dollars more than non certified organic and it contains no GMO's which is excellent. This is a great tasting and very beneficial product.There are a multitude of uses for coconut oil. It's a natural beauty product and it works inside and out. It's very good nutritionally as well as cosmetically. Vita Labs is one of the best coconut oils I have used. Coconut oil is a wonderful, natural diet aid. It's also shown to be beneficial in the fight against aging such as Alzheimer's disease as well as wrinkles.Coconut oil is excellent in cooking even with fried chicken! I know because I've done it and it creates a wonderful, lighter fried chicken. I also like to drink it in my coffee.The texture, scent and taste of Viva Labs Coconut Oil is excellent.Coconut oil can aid in the absorption of calcium and magnesium making it very beneficial for teeth and bone health. It can even help to lower blood sugar levels.Try for yourself! Viva Labs has created the ultimate Coconut oil with all the myriad of benefits this nutritious, healthy oil is known for!",5
"Viva asked me to review the product as a skin care product so here are my thoughts:I recommend that Viva package the product for use as a skin care product separately from its packaging as a cooking product.  I didn't cook with it.That said, I used it every day on my face for a month.  I was pleasantly surprised by its ability to be quickly absorbed.  It feels oily when it's applied, but not after about 15 minutes.  It doesn't alter the skin long term like a peel or a serum might, but in terms of hydration, I found it to be very effective.  I have very dry skin, especially in cold weather, so applying the product to my cheeks daily protected my face from the cold and made it appear more hydrated.  I'm 44 and am just starting to get lines around my eyes and mouth - they were considerably less visible each time I used the product on my face.  This trial certainly proved that hydrated skin looks better!  I am not super fond of the smell but it dissipates very quickly.  I also wear a physical sunblock daily along with a bit of foundation - the coconut oil didn't have a negative effect on those companion products.  I used my daily serum, then the coconut oil, then my sunblock/foundation combo.I recommend this for anyone struggling with keeping your skin hydrated, especially in the cold.Thanks for the sample Viva - nice product.",4
"I spent a lifetime using ""oil free"" products for oily/acne skin, only to finally discover that using good oils with antibacterial and healing properties, like good coconut oil, actually reduce your oil production and combat acne.You can use this in the kitchen, yes, and you should because it's got a delicate flavor and aroma and is clearly very pure. But it really shines in skincare. Find or buy a small container, and for each ounce of coconut oil you add to it, add 3-5 drops of tea tree oil (as a preservative and to keep your skin clear), plus a few drops of Neem oil if you have it and like it. Then use it as a base moisturizer. Try to leave it on for 5-30 minutes before you wipe the excess off and continue with your day. Your skin will take in what it needs.",5
"Thankfully more and more people are paying attention to organic, pesticide and  chemical additive free products these days. Taking that concept one step ffurther, if you have not included the uses of coconut oil both as a dietary supplement or cooking necessity as well as a maintenance care for skin and hair, now it's the time to consider this completely natural product. Viva Labs prides itself on maintaining 100% organic products and this extra virgin, cold pressed coconut oil is precisely that. Or as they phrase it, `every coconut that goes into Viva Labs Coconut Oil is handpicked at its peak for optimal freshness and nutritional value. USDA certified organic, non-GMO, non-hexane and free of bleach or deodorizers.'Some people may already use coconut oil as substitute choice where butter is called for in cooking and this wonderfully tasting product is as pure as any on the market. Others may be using some form of coconut oil as a skin moisturizer or hair conditioner. And there are those health conscious people who take advantage of the health supplement effects of adding the medium chain triglycerides (a unique form of fatty acids that are used by the body as a source of energy) to help maintain a healthy weight, increase stamina, promote thyroid health for an efficient metabolism, and boosting the immune system.Now, here in one well-packaged jar is the source of all of these uses. It simply is the finest money can buy. Highly recommended for all of the above stated uses. Grady Harp, October 13",5
"I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.  And I'm so glad I did, because honestly, the product is awesome.Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a great product, and I tried it in a few of the ways suggested on the side of the product.As a supplement - Okay, so this way is not for me.  I tried to take it as a supplement and I'm not a fan.  However, my husband thought it was great.  I would use the coconut oil as a supplement in something like my tea or coffee, though, but not straight up.As a moisturizer - Oh my gosh, this product as a moisturizer is just amazing.  I used it on my arms and legs, and not only did I smell like something that you'd want to eat (in a good way!), I also looked tanner and shiny without being oily, with a ""glow""!  Is it wrong for me to say I'm excited for the winter time so I have more excuses to wear the coconut oil as a lotion???To cook with - Skinny Bitch (a no-nonsense-get-healthy book) talked about using coconut oil to cook with, so I was REALLY excited to try it.  Last night, I decided to make a curried fish with baked sweet potato ""fries.""  I melted a little, coated the fish and the sweet potatoes, covered them with my curry powder, and baked it all in the oven.  It was delicious!  Not to mention healthier than using regular olive oil, so it's a win-win for sure.I haven't used it as a moisturizing mask yet for my hair, but I do plan on doing that in the winter once my hair is a little drier.  You know, so I can get the full effect of what it can do for my hair.  It'd probably also be great in the summer when my hair is affected by chlorine and salt water, too.  And obviously my hair will smell amazing.  I (hopefully) won't be able to keep my husband off of me!Remember: Coconut oil is solid, so you have to melt it for some of the uses, but it wasn't a problem at all for me.  It was actually pretty convenient.The only drawback was that on my specific jar, there was a UPC sticker covering the suggested uses.  It was inconvenient because there's a nice white space on the opposite side of the jar that would have been perfect for the sticker so as not to block the ""instructions.""  I had to scrape and peel off the label so that I could see the suggested uses.  Now this might not be a problem on everyone's jars, but I do believe it is something the company can easily fix and by doing so, will make their product even more amazing.Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book",5
"This is a lovely coconut oil:  Fragrant and full of flavor.  A big plus is its price-point and the fact that it is ""Cold Pressed"".  (Read my fourth paragraph.)I enjoy using coconut oil in my cooking and I'll even work a tablespoon into my hair every once in a while--especially in cold, dry weather.I have been using Jarrow's Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil prior to trying this one from Viva.  They are very close in taste:  Both are organic, with wonderful flavor and coconut smell.  I think maybe Viva's is a little fuller and stronger in flavor.  There is a big difference in price (comparing 15 and 16 ounce jars, not larger 2 pound jars) at this point in time, with Viva being much more economical.  I recommend giving it a try.I was curious between the difference in how the coconut oil is extracted:  Viva's oil is a ""cold pressed"" extraction process, while Jarrow's is ""expeller pressed"".  This is what I found out while researching:  ""Expeller pressed"" involves squeezing the oil out by way of a screw-type process.  Temperatures can reach up as high as 99 degrees Celsius.  ""Cold pressed"" actually presses the oil out and the process takes place at low temperatures usually below 60 degrees Celsius.  Bottom line?  The cold pressed method will preserve a bit more of the nutrients because of the lower temperature.  So again, Viva comes out the winner.I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs, and I will be buying a jar from them when this runs out, because I do like it very much.  (My first jar of Jarrow's was a sample, too.)",5
"I've recently gotten into coconut oil. I kept hearing everywhere about how good it was for you so I thought that I would do some research of my own on the subject. Tons of information is available on the web and some great pins on Pinterest if you are a pinner on the subject of coconut oil.Coconut has some amazing health benefits as well as being a wonderful moisturizer. You can use it in all sorts of homemade beauty products.For beauty products, you can probably use most coconut oils on the market but I would still stick with one that is Organic and Non-GMO. If you are going to use it as an oil in food or for a health supplement then I would get one that is also Extra Virgin. Everyone is probably aware of that term from the use of olive oil.The Viva Labs coconut oil is high quality oil that is suitable for cooking, health applications and beauty applications. It's organic, extra virgin, and is Non-GMO certified.This brand has that wonderful coconut scent and flavor. The flavor is very mild so if you think you might not like the flavor of coconut, don't let that deter you. Some brands have oils out there that have been processed and taken the flavor and scent out but not this one. It smells amazing! It smells like a wonderful toasted coconut and makes me want to slather it all over.It's pure, organic, smells wonderful and sold at a good price, I couldn't ask for more. This is my favorite brand of coconut oil that I've tried and will definitely be on my shopping list.~ I received a sample for review.",5
"Coconut oil is used everyday in my house from cooking to skin softening, to support for the thyroid in both humans and dogs. It has so many positive uses that I can't imagine living without it. I have several requirements when it comes to coconut oil and this product fits the bill. It must be organic, it must be NON-GMO, it must taste fabulous and it must be easy to cook with. This coconut oil is all that and more. I highly recommend Viva Labs coconut oil and I would like to suggest that the company make this product in a larger size jar for those of us who use it regularly. I need at least 32 oz a month as this would be more cost effective for me.As a nutritional supplement, coconut oil helps with the following:Improves digestive health/functionImproves absorption of nutrients (vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fat soluble phytonutrients)Prevents vitamin/mineral deficiencies (enhances nutritional value of the foods)Improves athletic performanceEnhances fetal growth and brain developmentImproves lactation and milk qualityActs as a protective antioxidantPrevents/treats malnutrition (better than other oils)Fortifies infant formulaFortifies hospital feeding formulasEnriches breast milk (nursing mother consumes the oil)Helps to keep blood sugars in balance (good for diabetics)Moderates glucose release into bloodstreamImproves insulin secretionImproves insulin sensitivityHelps with weight managementReduces steatorrhea (improves fat indigestion)Helps heal damage caused by celiac disease, improving nutrient absorption",5
"Most of us can probably remember back when coconut oil was considered a no-no for health reasons.  Times are changing and now it's being recognized for the many benefits it offers both in the heart-healthy diet and also as an external beauty aid.  Lauric acid, which is a saturated fat in coconut oil, has been shown to increase the good HDL cholesterol in the blood to help improve cholesterol ratio levels.  Studies also show that consuming coconut oil can help us with resistance to both viruses and bacteria, as well as fighting off yeast, fungus, and candida.In the kitchen, I love coconut oil for stir-frying vegetables and also as a base for salad dressings.  I've tried to increase the amount of fresh kale that our family eats and I find that the coconut oil adds a sweetness to the sometimes-bitter kale that other oils can't provide.  For supplements that are supposed to be taken with fat, I find it simple and tasty to just take them with a small teaspoon of the coconut oil straight from the jar.Viva Labs' extra virgin coconut oil has a very mild coconut taste and aroma.  It hasn't been refined or heavily processed and it has a creamy texture that sets up quite solid at cool temperatures and transforms to a much softer or near liquid form at very warm room temperatures.  I especially like the fact that it's certified organic and non-GMO (not genetically modified).I love using coconut oil outside of the kitchen, also.  It's a wonderful hair conditioner and body moisturizer with its abundance of protective vitamin E.  Just scoop a small amount out of the jar and allow it to warm and soften/liquefy in the palm of your hand.  For my hair, I'll then rub my hands together and massage the oil through my hair and scalp.  I try to leave it on for at least an hour before showering and shampooing my hair.  As a moisturizer, it smooths into your skin with a bit of a sheen, but leaves behind a nice fresh scent.Coconut oil is also great for pets.  I give both of my dogs coconut oil every day...about a teaspoon for the little one and nearly a tablespoon for our large German Shepherd (gradually increase to that amount).  I've also used it on dry, cracked paw pads.  It softens and soothes them and, unlike other moisturizers, it isn't harmful if licked off by your pet.  In fact, it's healthy for them if they do.Much of what I've read on coconut oil suggests a daily adult intake to be around two tablespoons per day for maximum benefit.A product sample was provided for reviewing purposes.",5
"I got interested in coconut oil a few months ago when I read on line that it has been found to be helpful in preventing Alzheimer's Disease.  You can do your own research, but as I am 65 and my mother died of this, I am hyper-alert to info of this nature.  Viva brand is the third brand I've tried so far.  I bought some from a local producer here in Ohio from a farmer's market (and have lost the name of the company and won't bother to get it again).  I have also used Sonoma Harvest from California.  In fact, I still have some of the Sonoma Harvest left in my kitchen so I did a side-by-side taste test.  The Viva brand is a much purer white color and tastes more truly of fresh coconut. I don't know if that matters to you, but it does to me.  I am using it in my cupcake baking right now.  It cooks up lovely.  Its not an overwhelming taste, but you can see the etiology of the oil from the origin.  The fact that its 100% Certified Organic is nice and extra virgin too.  I often use this coconut oil when I make oatmeal: about a tablespoon mixed in after cooking to have a pleasant way to eat it for the prevention of Alzheimer's onset.  As far as a skin lubricant, I am testing these side by side as well. The Sonoma Harvest is 'greasier' feeling anddoesn't absorb as nicely.  The other brand has a slightly rancid odor as well.  All in all, I find Viva brand to be superior in every way that counts.  One other comment.  For those who really are concerned about Alzheimer's I found a recent tip from the Edgar Cayce readings....published in Venture Inward magazine awhile back.  I will quote it in its entirety:  Its from Kevin Todeschi's column, A.R.E. Today (www.edgarcayce.org for more details).""Physically:  ""In the 30+ years I have been involved in the study and application of the Edgar Cayce material, I have been helped in countless ways.  At the present it appears that the Cayce health readings are literally saving me from the fate of both my parents and six older siblings, all of whom now suffer from, or have died with, Alzheimer's. I started using the Radiac seven years ago about the age the earliest signs of Alzheimer's showed up in most of my family.  (Two had acute Alzheimer's and died in their 50's and 60's).  At the present time I have none of their symptoms.  I shared the Radiac information with my one younger sibling, who is following my lead and using the Radiac. He is doing fine too.""  You can get info about purchasing the Radiac from www.iodinesource.com.I have been a speaker for the ARE for more than 30 years and am very familiar with their products and the integrity ofthe organization and the miraculous nature of Cayce's readings, particularly on health.  If you are interested in reading about Cayce, check this product link:Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet  Between this wonderful Coconut oil and the Radiac device, I am much more secure that I can keep Alzheimer's from my door.  This is just my opinion...no guarantee implied on any level.  This is excellent coconut oil, however.  Highly recommended!",5
"I have been struggling with my face breaking out in what is most likely a mild form of adult acne for about three years now and nothing seemed to work. I literally can not but any type of moisturizer on my skin or anything with any kind of spf without my face breaking out horribly. After reading through an online article about how coconut oil has been able to help with acne I figured it really couldn't hurt to try. So I have been using it at night on my face after I wash it before I go to bed once a day and honestly I can already see a result. I was afraid at first that it would clog my pores and make my face super shiny but it doesn't at all. I only put it on at night because it feels a little greasy and I don't want my face to get oily looking during the day. But I must say I have not had any major breakouts in the past week that I have been using this product and some of my scars/dark spots are even starting to fade. I will continue to use this product as long as it continues to make my face feel and look this great.I also tried using it in my hair which was another use I read about online. I have long, thin, blond hair that I wash twice a week. I woke up early and put some of the coconut oil in my hair and let it soak in for about 30 minutes and then washed it out which took about two washes to get it all out. I know a lot of articles suggested leaving it in for a few hours but since my hair is light and thin I didn't want it to be too oily. The 30 minutes seemed to be the perfect amount of time. I blow dried my hair and straightened it and it felt so much thicker and looked shiny but not oily and I was very happy with the end result.I have already recommended this product to everyone that I have seen on a daily basis since I started using it last week and there are still so many other uses I have planned for it! If you are thinking about buying this product, don't hesitate! You won't regret it!",5
"I am a coconut oil addict. I use it daily to wash my face and remove makeup(especially eye makeup). I cook and bake with it, even fry with it.The only thing I have not been able to figure out how to use it for is salad dressings. Anyway, this coconut oil is a tad bit more expensive than others I have been using, but the quality, taste and texture is amazing. It is the only coconut oil I can eat directly from the spoon. I highly recommend this brand.",5
I bought your product after Dr. Oz recommended coconut oil for skin care.  There is an improvement in patches of dry skin. My elbows are much smoother and not dried out.  I intend to use the coconut oil on my face to help with wrinkles.,5
"WOW! First off there are a ton of LONG reviews on here. I'm going to keep this as short as possible. I'm an avid coconut oil, coconut water, coconut sugar and coconut milk user.The first thing I noticed about this product was the USDA ORGANIC label. Many other labels don't have that same recognition. The second thing I noticed when I opened my container was I could smell fresh coconuts. For me, I love the smell and it made me feel like this product was more fresh. I have never tried any other brands that have that smell when you open it up.Now for the unfortunate part of my coconut oil smelling like coconuts. When I'm trying to cook with it and or use it on my popcorn with my special seasonings it leaves that coconut/sun tan lotion smell on my food. It tasted GREAT! I mean it was much lighter and cleaner tasting then most, but sometimes I try to hide the fact that I use that oil on my food for others sake. My neighbor and friends HATE coconut and when I tried serving it to my neighbor and friends they wouldn't even try it because they could smell the coconut.SO if you don't mind the coconut smell then I would say this is a great choice because it does taste better.",4
"I was so excited at the opportunity to try and review this product. I have been using coconut oil for many things these days and it has been a great help to my health and the well-being of my family, so when I was asked to review this product I jumped at the opportunity.Viva-Labs has a great, quality product here. I whipped up a small batch of oil with some essential oils to slather on after my shower and this oil was the best! It absorbed into my damp skin beautifully, and left me feeling velvety soft until my next shower. The texture is wonderful and the taste is very pleasant, especially for oil pulling and toothpaste. I have also been using this jar as a carrier for my essential oils and the very subtle scent of coconut is refreshing and does not take away from the scent of the oils. I have just a bit left that I will be using to make deodorant with.I haven't yet had the pleasure of trying this in my baked goods or on toast like one reviewer uses it for. But I can't wait to try!",5
"I don't give out five stars regularly. Usually, if I'm very satisfied with a product, I'll give it four stars. To give five stars, it must be something special.And this product certainly is. I use coconut oil in cooking, and this is a fantastic cooking oil. It has a great taste to it, and it just feels right; the product is invigorating.I'm not sure what else I can say, other than that the other rave reviews are accurate. This product is a winner.",5
"One of the finest coconut oils I have ever used! The flavor is pure and mild, the aroma is fresh and subtle, not overwhelming like some other brands. I use it in cooking, and with every recipe I have tried it with, it retains its mild individualistic flavor without overpowering the other ingredients in the recipe. Highly recommended as an supplement to your daily regimen, free of toxins and residues, it brings a wonderful taste with every bite. Definitely a 5 star product!",5
"Viva labs provided me with a sample of this wonderful coconut oil and I soon learned that not all coconut oil is the same.  I'd been using other products found at my local organic grocer, but never gave much thought to the consistency or oil textures.  Viva's is amazing!  It melts uniformly and solidifies uniformly.I decided to give the product a thorough test drive, so I used it as prescribed on the label.  For hair and scalp care it has done wonders clearing up my dry scalp and I no longer need to use conditioner.  In fact I was pretty thrilled to know that I wasn't putting any unnatural chemicals on my body.  I had a blister that healed quickly by rubbing some of it on, which took away the pain also.Since receiving the sample of Viva Coconut Oil two weeks ago I started adding a teaspoon to my tea in the morning.  What I noticed after about a week is that my appetite for unhealthy foods has been curbed significantly and I attribute this to the magic of coconut oil as a dietary supplement.  I decided to take a break from olive oil and use only the Viva Labs coconut oil for cooking.  I like the way the oil flavored a couple of ahi tuna stakes when I grilled them.  I even made a coconut cream cake (dairy free) using this oil.  The cake's consistency was nothing short of high end, which I attribute to the quality of the main ingredient, coconut oil.For the discriminating health conscious consumer, I highly recommend this product and will seek it out next time I'm shopping for coconut oil.  My experience with this product has me curious about others put out by Viva Labs.",5
"I will start off by telling you I am Italian, I have used Olive oil my whole life and never tried anything else. So it took me a while to know what to use this product with.  (Trial and very bad error!! don't make spaghetti or tomato sauce with it).I found that cooking American, Japanese  dishes or Italian deserts works well with the oil. BUT NOT Spaghetti..( cold shivers)But I also found that my dog ( 2 ) and four of my  (12 ) cats... just kidding  ( 5) cats love the taste and I found that it is very good for their coats and skin. One day while trying to cook with the oil my two dogs (Prissy a shih tzu and Shotzi my Pompom) were in the kitchen jumping up and down wanting what I had. So I took  a spoon ( that my husband says his and only his ... so don't tell him) and let them lick a little oil thinking they would taste it and leave, after them the firkin cats had to get in on the action and the next thing I know I had to lock everyone out of the Kitchen. Needless to say, their coats are sleek and shiny. ( I tried to put a little on Prissy's tummy for dry skin but she would not stop licking herself.Do some research look at what can be done. I had a ball working in the kitchen with it",5
"As someone who enjoys coconut oil for cooking and skin regime and has tried many different brands in the past, this coconut oil is second to none.How I use it:Every morning, i take a small dime size amount of coconut oil and rub it in my hands together until it becomes liquid, then slowly apply over arms and enjoy as natures best moisterizer.  No need for $100 creams.  This $9 tub does the trick, is all natural and is just as good if not better.As a family who eats rice virtually every day, we love substituting regular oil for coconut oil in our rice.  It has just a hint of coconut and tastes far better, not to mention is medium chain triglicerides and is far healthier for you.Final Comments:It's not the cheapest coconut oil, but for aproximately $1 more per tub it's well worth it considering the quality and freshness.",5
"Yesterday, I did a taste test.  I tasted a brand of coconut oil I have enjoyed, then I tasted Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  It has a smoother texture and a delightful coconut flavor.  I love it for cooking.  It can be used as a spread, instead of butter, and my husband likes it on his oatmeal.  I also make an uncooked sugar free chocolate candy with it.  When refrigerated, it is as firm as any chocolate candy bought in the store with a texture similar to chocolate truffles.  I also love what coconut oil does for my skin.  Since I have begun using coconut oil as a moisturizer, I can see a difference in the texture of my skin.  I transfer some into a small sterile jar and keep it with my toiletries.  Why use expensive creams when I can use something natural that gives my skin a more youthful appearance and a glow?  Really--I'm not kidding.So I am back to including coconut oil in more of my meals.  Last summer, I lost 8 pounds by substituting coconut oil for some of my butter and by cutting back to almost no sugar.  I think I am ready to do that again, since recently, I have been a little lax in watching what I eat.  Using coconut oil is a healthy alternative to other types of fats, and it actually helps improve the body from the inside out.  I put it in pancakes, muffins, and cakes.  I also saute and fry foods in it. On days I haven't cooked with coconut oil, I have even been known to add some to a smoothie.Yes, I am sold on the benefits of coconut oil, and I'm happy I tried this brand of coconut oil.",5
"Great oil and great flavor.  The extra virgin coconut oils are sweetish, this oil has a wonderful sweet flavor when cool, but when added to meats and cooked it doesn't alter the flavor of the meat it only enhances it.  Previously with cooking meat I made sure to only get virgin or normal coconut oils, this oil also has such a nice texture that I'm happy to use it as spread on my toast instead of butter.  And it adds nicely to the flavor of sweets and icings that just need a hint of oil and sweetness to improve the overall food product.",5
"Ok, full disclaimer: I was given a review sample of this product. Oh, and we can't usually afford organic extra virgin non-GMO coconut oil. We have six kids, and a small budget :)Moving past the disclaimers, this was good stuff. First of all, it arrived right on time, and I like the package. I suppose it was tough for them to decide what kind of package to put this in: since it is marketed both for cooking and 'skin and hair care'. The package stressed a little of the latter, but was good for both.So far we have used the oil primarily for cooking. We have been trying to get away from the standard 'cooking oil'; especially as we have learned more and more about the evils of GMO foods and the way the big farmers and seed companies are using them to destroy small farmers and sufficiency growers. So I was glad to add this to the list of different oils we have been trying.Coconut oil was fun to use, with a couple of tricks. My daughter says it burns a little easier than some other oils, and I found out you can't use it in a marinade if the meat is too cold (the oil solidifies). But it was really great to use with my Chinese cooking. It really added a different taste twist, especially to my chicken meals (we're not rich enough for me to have been able to fool around with shrimp like some other reviewers. Perhaps I can find a shrimp company that needs reviews :) ).I also used it on chicken that I would saute and then bake, and it did well there. We found it goes well in a breaded baked chicken, adding a different zip to the bread.All in all we really enjoyed this product, and plan on continuing to. I can't speak to the price or comparison with similar oils, as we are still getting started with our testing. Next I think we're going to try some Pecan oil...",5
"Some months ago, the manufacturer of this Coconut Oil contacted me and sent me a sample of this product for review. It sat unopened until this week, when we used up our previous jar of coconut oil (from Trader Joe's).This oil is truly amazing, and pure. It is an excellent cooking oil, which we have used for fried tofu, and also to eat by the tablespoon, as a dietary supplement.Given the curative properties of coconut oil, and the particularly extra pure nature of this item, I can well understand why there are now nearly 1,500 mostly rave reviews of this item.Thank you Viva. I love this product, and I will be back for more.",5
"I had heard everyone talking about how great natural coconut oil was so I ordered some to try it for myself. For the money you get alot and just a little goes a long way too. My husband has terrible dry, cracked feet and we had tried everything....this worked wonders on both our feet. Its great as an all over moisturizer, lip balm...the list goes on. The bonus is that you smell like a tropical island as well.",5
"I love this stuff.  I've never ordered coconut oil before, and this has me converted.  It'll last forever, it doesn't expire, it's an incredible moisturizer, and it  It smells absolutely incredible, and it actually tastes surprisingly good, too.  I didn't buy it to eat, but it's a really good, much lower cholesterol alternative to butter.  I'm buying another one as soon as I run out.",5
I use it on my skin and hair.I especially use it on my hair.I am a natural AA women and this is great for sealing moisture in my hair as well as moisturizing. I will be ordering more when I get low.,5
"This seems to be a very good coconut oil, and a good deal on Amazon after researching and reading. It is lightly fragrant, enough that if you don't like it you won't want to use it for delicious softly scrambled eggs. I am sharing it with my greyhound, who loves some mixed in his breakfast kibble. As others have noted, it is a solid at temperatures less than about 75 F. We're about half way through our first jar, and I will order more.",4
"I have read all of the hype on coconut oil and it's benefits so I decided to order this. I cannot say enough about this product. I bought it for relief of my dry hands and skin. I am always seeking something that can heal my hands. As a nurse, the constant hand washing and gloves leaves my hands dry and cracked. Thank the oil gods who discovered this! This product is so nice on the hands and feet! It is a bit congealed in the container but starts to melt immediately when in contact with skin. Unlike other oils, it does not clog pores or stay greasy once applied. It has a nice mild coconut smell thst does dissappear quickly and does not clash with any fragrances applied after.The true magic of this oil is it seems to help all skin issues. Not to over share, but in my household it has cleared up razor burn and bumps, athletes foot, my dogs itchy hot spots, and is making progress on a toe fungus. Applied daily to feet, toes , and itchy areas after a shower seems to be great treatment! My feet are softer than they have ever been just by doing this routine.I will by this product again and again, just unbelievable.I know some use this oil to cook or add to food, or coffe, but I do not like the taste of coconut,  so for me it is a topical only.",5
I gave this coconut oil 5 stars because so far it is the best I have used on my skin and it smells delicious. I started using coconut oil on my face in the evenings to help with breakouts and to help my skin look fresher. I immediately noticed a change in my acne and also the redness started to disappear giving me a more even skin tone. I even used it on my hair one night when my ends looked a bit fried. It softened them right up after keeping it on overnight. I will definitely continue using this brand of coconut oil.,5
"I just received this Coconut Oil and truth be told, I only ordered this one because my current one couldn't be ordered through prime, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  My old favorite is EfaGold, so I will compare a bit.  The Eva Gold from Nature's Way has a stronger aroma upon opening, but is somewhat harder in consistency and not as easily spreadable off the bat as the Viva.  The Viva didn't have a strong aroma of coconut oil upon opening (I know that some people don't like the stronger aromas, but I do), but once I cut into it, I could definitely smell a very light and pleasing scent.  I actually put it into my teas in the morning time and like the taste of coconut oil mixed with my herbal teas.  I know this is gross to some, but for me, it's heavenly.  I also use this for my skin, hair, and cooking. I believe that coconut oil has controlled my appetite, smoothed my skin, and allowed me to loose some weight.  Time will only tell if it will meet all of my needs, but I wanted to point out the lighter less heavier coconut taste and smell, and also the creamier spreadability as I know from reading other reviews that there are many differences in opinions.  I can definitely see spreading this on toast or a bagel with ease, or even using it for frying. So the only reason I'm giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because I like a super strong coconut taste and smell.  Otherwise, it's great!  Shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. Hope this review helps somebody.",4
I have to admit that I have been using nutiva coconut oil for all of my needs and never thought I would use anything else until I found this product. Viva Labs organic coconut oil seems to be of a greater quality and richness. By far the best brand I've tested.,5
"I heard great stories about coconut oil and they are indeed true! I use it for my hair and my beard and oh are they so soft! I let it sit in my hair for 1-2 hours before a shower and does the trick. You can also use this product in the bedroom, if you know what I mean ;)  I would buy a second jar for hygienic reasons if you do.",5
"Great for a face wash with baking soda, great for extra conditioning hair, there are a ton of uses for coconut oil...",5
"After using steroidal creams, OTC products, and every kind of dandruff shampoo on the market, I finally decided to give going natural a shot. The last product I tried was a sulfur-based ointment that not only made me have a horrible allergic reaction, but also stank so bad of chemicals that I was ready to try a kinder, gentler treatment. I was skeptical of using something as simple as coconut oil, but figured for the price, what did I have to lose?The day after I placed my order, Dr. Oz had a segment on natural remedies and, sure enough, coconut oil was at the top of his list for scalp eczema. A little more hopeful after that endorsement, when I received the oil I followed his suggestion and warmed the product just enough to melt and use a cotton ball for application. I then put on a head wrap and left it on overnight, washing out the next morning. After two nights of doing this, I can state unequivocally that it puts the other products to shame.The icing on the cake is that this product smells terrific and it makes my hair so soft. And it's so affordable! I was paying upwards of $40 for some of my prescriptions, not to mention the cost of doctor visits. What a find!",5
"I can't really believe I'm saying this, but coconut oil tastes good. I've never liked coconut anything, but after reading about the health benefits of coconut oil, I decided to try it. It adds an amazing flavor to almost anything. My morning oatmeal is delicious. Homemade popcorn - out of this world. Definitively a great purchase.",5
"I use it form my face and body, it is great : ))my skin become beautiful :)does someone know, may I use it everyday? I know, using oil everyday, it provoke suppress pores. thanks.",5
Disclaimer: I am using this as moisturizer so I don't know how would it work as cooking oil. Moving on:I have started using coconut oil as all over moisturizer. I love my skin and I have no complains. Extra Virgin cold pressed oil is recommended for best results. I am going to review about this particular brand.1) Does not have strong smell which means I can use it at day time as well.2) I love the packaging - it has wide mouth which means I don't have to melt it in winters.3) It is much softer - I have used Wholefoods brand before and this is much softer. Melts fast on my skin.4) It was cheaper than what I would get in Wholefoods. It is a bigger tub for almost 70% off.Overall happy and satisfied. Now I wish it was subscribe and save and I would get it every 3 months.,5
"As a dietitian, I recommend this coconut oil to my patients.  I love that it is non-GMO and organic and the taste is fantastic. I love using it in stir-fry's and it bakes very well also. This is definitely a high quality coconut oil that does not disappoint.Angela Grassi, MS, RDNAuthor, The PCOS Workbook & PCOS: The Dietitian's Guide",5
"I love this oil, I use it for everything, I only ordered one, and I will order another since I use the one for hair, body, wounds, etc... It works for everything. I'll get another one for cooking. Best oil, the best ALL in One no need to buy a bunch of different oils.",5
"Let me start by saying - I am NOT a fan of eating anything coconut. I have used many shampoos and conditioners that have a coconut fragrance and I am fine with that.Prior to using this product, I had used one other jar of coconut oil from a different source. There isn't much difference (in my opinion) in the two, other than this being extra virgin and the previous one being virgin. The textures and scents seem very similar. (I rated this product 5 stars and would rate the other product I've used as 5 stars.)If you have not used coconut oil before, know that it is a SOLID oil at room temperature, not like most oils. It will warm up and melt in your hands if you use it as a beauty product - or on the stovetop if you cook with it.My container of coconut oil stays in the bathroom and I keep a spoon there to be able to easily get it out of the jar.One of my favorite ways to use coconut oil is on my hair - I simply put a little bit in my hands and rub them together to melt the oil, then spread it through my hair after I shower. I tend to just leave it in my hair for the day and wash it out the next day when I shower, but it will leave your hair oily/greasy looking, so you may not be able to do that. I wear my hair in a bun and just call it a hat day when I've got oil in my hair. If you can't leave it in for a whole day, try putting it in your hair overnight (you may want to use something to protect your pillow from getting greasy if you try this option), or just put it in fifteen minutes before you shower. Any of these options will have a similar end result, with your hair being shiny and soft. I'd recommend using it on your hair about once a week.Another of my favorite ways to use coconut oil is to mix it in with my face moisturizer. I don't care for putting the coconut oil directly onto my face because it is very oily, but mixing it in with my moisturizer leaves my face with a fresh, shiny glow...and I like it as a base for using liquid makeup as it gives it good spreadability. You can do this as often as you like or just do it once a week for an extra treatment.Now, I was curious because I've heard so many people saying that coconut oil does not taste like coconut, but the smell when you open the jar is like a pure tropical explosion. I did taste a bit straight out of the jar, and it didn't taste like I was eating shampoo (which most coconut foods taste like to me), but it did have a slight flavor. Definitely not as strong as I was expecting.I also used this in place of the oil in my regular pizza crust recipe, and it gave the crust a wonderfully crispy texture and only if I was being really picky would I say it altered the flavor. It was the very slightest difference from the normal taste, most people probably wouldn't even notice it. (My family didn't.)If I planned to use it in the kitchen and as a beauty product I would get two jars, but for now my one jar stays happily in my bathroom.FTC Declaration: The manufacturer has provided me with a complimentary container of this product. This does not change the fact that I will give my honest opinion in my reviews.",5
"This coconut oil is great. It smells like coconut, of course, but it's not overtly fragrant. It's a real great consistence. It's solid, but melts into a clear oil instantly upon applying to the skin.My kids and I have varying degrees of eczema and I'm always looking for something non-prescription to make it better. Not only is this natural, it's organic. It's non-GMO. So pure you can eat it - which is actually recommended for weight loss. Supplemental information is available on the label, as well as skin care and hair care instructions.",5
"I have been using coconut oil for about 7 years now, and I use it for lots of reasons: frying, baking, different types of skincare. The Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil worked great for all of those things (details below). But what set it apart from the other brands I have tried (the brands usually available at my local Whole Foods store) is the rich, fresh coconut smell. Now, I don't use any oils that smell ""off,"" but this oil had the freshest, sweetest smell of any coconut oils I have tried. Here's how it worked for me:Baking: I melted a half cup of oil to make brownies. If your house is kept pretty warm, you might find coconut oil to be soft at room temperature, but we had to add some heat. Since I have lots of friends on modified diets (for reasons either religious or allergic), I like to bake gluten free, dairy free brownies fairly often. The coconut oil worked well with both GF flour and regular wheat flour. It moistens about the same as butter, but leaves a lighter crumb. While the fragrance of coconut oil is strong at first, it does not overwhelm the other flavors in baking. The Viva oil was a win here.Saute: I often cook greens or brussels sprouts in olive oil, but I wanted a saturated fat this go around. The Viva coconut oil did great for sauteing brussels sprouts, and again, though it smelled nice, it left a neutral flavor.Treating eczema: The Viva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil actually eliminated a bout of cold-weather eczema when I treated the affected area each night before bed. I was actually surprised that the eczema totally went away! I don't know if it was the freshness of the oil, or a mild case, but I usually have to wrestle with a recurrent patch of eczema for a few months, and this oil got rid of it in two weeks.Facial moisturizer: My skin is quite sensitive right now, as I am expecting twins in the spring, so my usual moisturizers were irritating. Taking advice from a friends, I tried this Viva oil, and it works great as a facial moisturizer for sensitive skin. After a few minutes to soak in, my skin felt smooth and non-greasy. The fresh scent was lovely, too.Lip balm: This goes right along with face moisturizer. A nearly tasteless, but rich smelling alternative to processed lip balms, and it felt great!For shaving: Worked great!All in all, I would say that this oil worked as well as other organic extra virgin coconut oils for kitchen use, but its smell was the best of any others I've tried. The potency for skincare was unparalleled, though. Highly recommended!",5
"I am one of those people who keeps their food and beauty products separated. I remember in the 90s when mayonnaise was praised as a great hair treatment for all sorts of problems, most likely also attracting the discerning bear when they come after you in the park. Then there is olive oil, great for hair and skin. Though I am sure that there are benefits, I just have a hard time thinking of lugging in a tub of Hellman's to the bathtub in the hopes my hair becomes extra smooth. So you can imagine my skepticism when I received Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (henceforth referred to as EVCO) and read the label. There is also the minor issue that, while I love the smell of coconut in my shampoos and the like, there are few coconut food products that I eat (unless you count Lava Flow mixed drinks...). But, I agreed to give my honest opinion of the product, so I set my jaw and went to work.Flavor, Food, and DrinkAs I mentioned above, I am not a huge eater of coconut foods. I absolutely despise shaved coconut on anything, but the flavor of coconut infused into something without having to nosh on those horrible shavings tends to go over better. While apprehensive at first, I opened the tub and dipped my finger in. The taste, as can probably be imagined, is VERY concentrated. It is not overpowering, but between the lovely aroma and the strong ""tropical"" flavor, you are definitely adding a distinctive flavor to your dish.For me, I decided that I would use the oil for homemade ice cream. My recipe was simple: vanilla yogurt, granulated sugar, a tablespoon of the EVCO, a pinch of salt, heavy cream, and some pineapple chunks. I blended everything together; the EVCO did not separate from the mix like you might expect. When combined with the creaminess of the dairy products and the traditional marriage of coconut and pineapple, the result was delightfully exotic and definitely took me back to the time that I spent in Maui several years ago. In addition, once added to the ice cream maker (I use the Kitchenaid kit for my mixer), it blended smoothly and into a consistent mixture of ice cream. Finally, after sitting in the freezer overnight, the EVCO-Pineapple ice cream set beautifully and was served over a slice of pound cake. The EVCO added a lovely flavor of coconut that was not overpowering and truly brought out the flavor of the ice cream.In summation: there are lots of other recipes that this product can be used for; I see other reviews that show it being used as a frying oil and also for other tasty vittles. Thus, if you want a lovely coconut flavor for your savory, sweet, or mixed drinks, the EVCO is a fine choice and is sure to please. The added bonus of it being USDA Organic is also a plus should you be concerned about the use of pesticides.Health & BeautyAfter I was able to get over my weird issues with bringing something that I have ingested as a food into the bathroom, I discovered that EVCO is more than amazing when included in your hair and skin care routines. I first decided to try the oil on my fingernails; due to my lupus the skin cracks around them and it is rather painful. I have tried all sorts of lotions and creams, to no avail. Since I had nothing to lose I gave the EVCO a chance. Over three days I used it twice daily, massaging the oil into the skin. By the third day the skin was definitely softer, but the cracks were still about the same as when I first started applying the EVCO. So, as a moisturizer I can definitely attest to the efficacy of this product; if you have severely dry skin you may need to supplement the EVCO with another product. This is why I deducted one star from my rating. If the oil had healed my skin more so than it did, this product would be a 5-star ""must have"".For hair care I took the following steps: I would shampoo my hair as normal with my usual brand (Garnier Fructis). After a thorough rinse I would pat my hair dry (not completely, but enough so that water wasn't dripping) and massage the oil slowly through my hair by starting at the scalp and working it down through the tips. My hair is curly and roughly shoulder length so it took roughly five-to-seven minutes to complete this part. Once I worked it in I let it sit for two minutes, and then I rinsed it out completely. Afterward I allowed my hair to dry naturally; the end result was shiny, lustrous hair that was not greasy or ""wet-looking"". In fact my hair looked so healthy that I have permanently shifted the bottle from my kitchen and into my bathroom! It has replaced my V05 Hot Oil Treatment products as my weekly deep moisturizing routine! It smells great, leaves no residue, and you will end up with sexy, smooth, shiny hair that will definitely earn you many compliments!Final SayTo summarize, as I know that this review is rather lengthy:Pros:1) Smells great without being overpowering;2) Adds beautiful shine and a healthy nourishment when used as a moisturizer for hair;3) Helps to soften the skin when used as a lotion;4) Tastes great and is a wonderful product for both savory and sweet foods;5) Is USDA Organic, so you know that you are getting a healthy product without the fear of fertilizers or other contaminants.Cons:1) While it helps as a skin moisturizer, for any condition beyond ""regular dryness"" you may need a secondary product;2) I wish that the tub had a spout or some other method to ensure that the product stays sanitary when moving from the kitchen into the bathroom and vice/versa.Thus, as you can see, Viva Labs has a great product for you to use. It smells wonderful, is extremely flexible for a variety of uses, and no matter how you choose to add your purchase to your daily regimen I can assure you that you will be satisfied with the results!**Disclaimer: This headset was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

"This is a five-star product IFF you like the smell and taste of coconut. I made some oatmeal cookies and make some frosting/cream stuff with the coconut oil to put in the middle, like moon pies. I don't like the smell and taste of coconut, and the smell was strong. However, all the guests at the party I brought those cookies to liked them and most had two or three.At room temperature the coconut oil is a solid and can be used like you'd use shortening or butter. It's white, so it would color well if you're going to make frosting and decorate a cake.",5
"The coconut oil comes in a plastic container in a very solid consistency. You have to really did at it to get the oil out. You do not need as much as you would vegetable oil, so keep that in mind.I have been using this product for a little over a month now and I am hooked. Why would I use any other kind of oil again when cooking vegetables? No reason! I am a true convert. I have used this product for a variety of food products including sweet plantains. I was surprised at how well the food turned. First, your kitchen smells amazing, but the flavor is not strong enough to alter the flavor of your food.I have started using the coconut oil for its beauty benefits and will update this after a few more weeks of use. To date, I am happy with the results.*The vendor/manufacturer provided me with this product for free for the purposes of an honest review.",5
"This was my first venture into real coconut oil.  Great stuff!  I am using it for my skin, haven't tried cooking with it.  It smells heavenly, and a tiny bit goes a long way.  My troubled skin (acne, eczema) feels soothed.  I have yet to see if it breaks me out, but I will definitely use this to relieve itching for my eczema.  I had been using a coconut beauty oil from The Body Shop to help up until this point.  It's a keeper!",5
"I was sent a jar by the manufacturer. I've been using it in many ways to see if it really was all that is was cracked up to be.It is.  From using it in my hair with spectacular results to boosting my animals' daily meals, this stuff is amazing. I've even used it on my heels to take them from ""omg is that a crocodile on your foot"" to ""baby butt soft"".My favorite use is in my hair. I have curly hair that dries out in the Texas weather. Putting the coconut oil in for a few hours then washing it out has really helped. Even my honey has noted that my hair looks better these days.And the dogs both have beautiful coats. I am sure that it is this oil that has helped. They've always been on premium dog foods but the coconut oil addition really boosted their coats to a gleam.I don't know that I would have tried this otherwise, but I am very glad that I did.And I haven't even tried cooking with it yet! :D New horizons await!",5
I used my free coconut oil in baking and it performed very well - you can read my experience here: http://www.brokenteepee.com/2013/11/baking-for-firemen-chocolate-cupcakes.htmlI was pleased with the way my cupcakes turned out. It is a bit costly for me to use on a regular basis but I was very happy with how it worked. While still a saturated fat it is slightly better for one than other saturated fats. I haven't tried it in any other applications but they sound intriguing. I love the taste of coconut but my husband does not so I need be careful where I use it when I cook. Overall I was very happy with it.,4
"I'm a big fan of coconut oil and have posted my thoughts about it in previous reviews. The benefits of good coconut oil can also be found online in various venues. To make a long story short -- if you're looking for a quality, multi-purpose coconut oil, then Viva Labs #1 should fit the bill.It works great for cooking applications, especially those that might benefit from Viva's mild yet noticeable coconut flavor and aroma. It is also excellent as a tonic for the skin and hair. It can be eaten with pleasure by the spoonful as well.This isn't a cheap product, but I don't think one can dispute it's quality. It feels wonderful on the skin and can be used sparingly as a conditioner for the hair. I can easily sip a spoonful for its healthful properties, and it mixes well with many different dishes. It makes a great cooking oil as well. The taste is mild so isn't overly intrusive in any dish, but it will give food a ""tropical"" flavor.I have no complaints about this product. Some may question the use of a plastic container, but I don't feel that it impacts the quality of the product in any way. I received a complimentary sample from the distributor for review purposes.~ Kort",5
"Other than extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), there is seldom a product that is as useful and healthy as it is delicious. There are simply too many uses for extra-virgin coconut oil (shall we call it EVCO?) to name, and Viva Labs makes THE BEST coconut oil ever. First of all, it's non-GMO and organic. Secondly, it smells like you are holding paradise in the palm of your hand. From there, you can go crazy with it. Use Viva Labs coconut oil to curb hunger for a while between meals (some people swear by coconut oil as a weight-loss tool--I don't know for sure, but it's worth researching--and it does sate your appetite). Use it to stir-fry veggies, meat, noodles or any combo thereof. Add a smidgen to chocolate to smooth the consistency. I've used it as an ingredient in homemade body butter--yes, like the stuff you get at The Body Shop--only made by you. Coconut oil is an amazing food/beauty product. Google it and you can read for days about its many uses. But if you are going to buy coconut oil, be sure to buy Viva Labs, because you will be getting the very best available.",5
"If your only experience with coconut oil is some low quality version such as Lou Ann's then you have no idea about how amazing it can actually be. Viva Lab's Coconut Oil is the first one I've tried that I lick the spoon clean after scooping some out. The flavor is rich and completely coconuty without any cloying vegetable oily flavor. It also has a very pleasing, smooth texture which in combination with its light, tropical scent makes it perfect a base for my various herbal ointments. While rubbing the ointments onto my and my children's skin makes me think of the beach rather than the greasepit at McDonalds.One other tip, a mixture of 2 parts Viva Labs Coconut Oil blended into 4 parts Nutella gives and excellent, power-filled ""goo"" for backpacking.",5
"This is a nifty oil that is versatile.  I tried it for skin conditioning, it's about on par with baby oil in the texture, but has that  nice ""I'm in the islands"" smell.  So, rather than just moisturizing, you're having a mini-me vacation experience.My husband is the family chef, and declared that the bottle should reside in the kitchen, not the restroom, because he intends to cook with it.  He claims that all really good Chinese style dishes are created with this oil as the base instead of olive oil.A little goes a long way, and since you can eat it, wear it, and use it to polish wood floors (by accident of course)  it is a good accessory for any home, well worth the money.I was given a sample of the product in return for a fair honest review.  My only complaint is that I should buy another jar, so I don't have to go looking for it every time I need it.",5
"This coconut oil can definitely compete with the other top brands and is at a great, competitive price. It has an excellent, mild taste. I use it for cooking (frying eggs, sauteing veggies, and baking.) I also eat it by the spoonful, use it as a skin moisturizer and use it in my DIY body care recipes. You cannot beat the health benefits of coconut oil and I highly recommend this brand.",5
I bought this coconut oil on the advice of fellow members of a lichen sclerosis forum. It works so well at keeping the affected skin lubricated that I now use it as my sole body lotion and my husband uses it too.,5
"I love products that are versatile and natural. This is both. Just some uses I found:Hair: scoop some out, warm in hand, work through hair. Leave in 1-2 hours, then wash. I washed once and it didn't feel greasy. Left hair shiny and smooth. I use it about once a week.Skin: this is fabulous for dry skin. Hands, feet, elbows, wherever. Looking forward to using it this winter. Just working it into dry skin then washing it off made a huge difference.Lip balm: I couldn't find my lip balm so I tried a bit of this. Very moisturizing and smells nice.Massage oil: no worries about spilling. Melt a bit between your palms and it is the perfect temperature. The texture is just right for a massage oil and the scent is very tropical but not overpowering. I received this product for my honest review and plan to keep using it. A wonderful product.",5
"Skin care: Viva Labs' coconut oil is excellent for softening that dry spot or rough patch, and is very soothing to the skin. Additionally it helps to combat skin infections. For me coconut oil is too heavy to use EVERYWHERE at once.Dietarily: This coconut oil smells delicious, and is incredibly smooth. I require a lot of calories, so it is common for me to just eat a spoonful of coconut oil (which, in this case, is a treat).I am thrilled with Viva Labs' coconut oil!",5
"This is a very good quality product. 100% certified organic, extra virgin, cold pressed, 100% pure, food grade coconut oil. Extremely fragrant, this oil is a delight to use. I have been using coconut oil as a hair and skin moisturizer and am extremely pleased with this product by Viva Labs.A sample was provided by the manufacturer in return for an honest review.",5
"This coconut oil is great for dry skin. It takes a little while for it to soak in, because it is an all natural product. I especially like the aroma and it is excellent on toast too. My wife and I both enjoy this oil for skin care and I highly recommend it.",5
"If you haven't been living under a rock you have probably heard about the health benefits of coconut oil. It softens your hair, moistens your skin, cures your cuticle problems, and smells delicious, which brings up its other virtues. You can cook with it. It's a great substitute for butter or shortening in muffins and other baked goods. I love it on sweet potatoes.There are many coconut oils on the market. For purity, this one from Viva Labs cannot be beat. It is certified organic and GMO-free. It is, as some have mentioned, hard at room temperature, but it has such a low melting temperature that it dissolves on your skin. If you make your own cosmetics, you will want to add a jar to your kit.",5
"The list of healthful benefits and ways to use coconut oil are too numerous to mention here  Google it and youll see what I mean. Ive used this jar of Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to cook a fried egg (it was crispy and delicious and the kitchen smelled like buttered popcorn) and to moisturize my skin and hair. It even works pretty well as hair gel, though the coconut smell is not ideal. A little goes a long way, so apply it sparingly on your body. As a moisturizer, coconut oil might work best on dry elbows or knees, the extremities of your body rather than on your face. It leaves a sheeny gloss on your skin that you dont normally see after using most moisturizers.Eating a few tablespoons of coconut oil could do your body a world of good, so you might consider it. As expected, its oily and tastes like coconut, with a buttery taste. Though it takes a bit of getting used to, coconut oil has a refreshing taste that grows on you.When its warm in your house this oil is soupy and easy to spoon out; during the winter it turns harder. Ive heard it works well as coffee creamer  maybe Ill try it tomorrow morning.Finally, Ive heard over and over to use organic extra virgin coconut oil, which is what this brand is. Overall, I like this coconut oil a lot.",4
"Viva Labs ""Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil"" appears to do everything right.First of all the product is excellent high quality coconut oil.The appearance is great, a nice beautiful ""off white"".  It's smooth and not gritty (while solidified).  The aroma is a nice gentle ""coconut"" smell.It's nice that it's non-GMO certified but as far as I know there are no GMO coconuts so that is a bit of moot point currently.The labeling is excellent.  Good information is provided.  I really like that the label specifies that it is good for cooking up to 350 degrees (most sources just mention that coconut oil is good for ""high heat"" cooking, few bother to mention that you shouldn't go above 350 degrees).The labeling doesn't leave you guessing.  They specifically mention that it is: * Free of pesticides, bleach, hexane and trans fats * certified organic and non-GMO * unrefined, extra virgin, cold pressedGood healthy stuff!",5
"I love this coconut oil for my body and also to cook with, adds a great flavor to shrimp!  Good!",5
"This is an amazing product.  I was loyal to Nutiva coconut oil for years, but we're stationed overseas and can't get it shipped to an APO address any more.  The Viva Labs coconut oil is perfect for both cooking and skin care needs.  It has a nice, subtle flavor that we use for everything from stir frying, topping popcorn, diaper rashes, and hair masks.  We go through a container every few weeks, so the price on this is perfect.",5
Quality oil.  Has the aroma and flavor of coconut.  Never thought I would replace butter with anything but now love this and don't want the butter.,5
"I found the oil to be very useful in numerous ways. And the amount you need is far less than I originally thought--it really goes a long way.I tried it instead of shampoo and found it really made my scalp feel good. You only need a tiny pinch of it, lest you want to have an oily head all day. You are not looking to coat the hair so much as spread a very thin amount around and work it into your scalp.As for a body treatment, again, you only need a very small amount. I was worried that I would smell like a pia colada, but found that it was a soft, mellow scent that went away soon thereafter. I was shocked at how little I really needed, about a tenth of what I normally use in lotion form.While I normally hate the taste of coconut, I found it to be quite smooth and palatable. I personally don't see myself eating it straight, but if I had to I would eat this brand. Cooking with it would be more my speed as a replacement for butter.We live in San Francisco, so the contents remain really solid. It melts immediately to the touch, so if you live in an area where it is warm you may want to keep this in a cool place.A high quality product that I can recommend for a multitude of uses from replacements for lip balm, lotions and shampoo, to a great cooking ingredient. This tub will last you a long time.",5
"I have dry, itchy skin a lot of the time, and I'm always trying to find a way to get rid of it. Especially in the winter, since it is so cold and dry here. A friend of mine recommended I start using coconut oil. I did, and I've tried several different brands of it. Some have been better than others.Viva Labs is definitely one of my favorite brands so far. The part I love most about it is the smell. It smells like coconut, but not in an overwhelming way like a coconut-scented product might. When I put it on my skin after my shower, it smells so sweet and fresh! (You might not know it, but not all coconut oils actually smell good. Oils made from young coconuts smell lovely, while oils made from old coconuts are unscented.)You may notice that this comes in a white, plastic jar. This is a good thing, I promise you. I've had coconut oils that come in glass or clear plastic jars, and they don't last as long. The coconut oil I bought right before this came in a glass jar and actually got moldy! The white plastic jar protects the oil and keeps it fresh.I am also glad that it is made with non-GMO coconuts. Even though I am using it for skin care, and not eating it, it is important to me to have non-GMO products because they are better for the environment as a whole.When I run out of this jar of coconut oil, I am definitely going to look for another jar of Viva Labs!",5
"I use coconut oil every single day. I was recently asked if I'd like to try one new to the market, for free, Well, why not??  I use it all the time already, so was delighted to receive a jar of Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil from Viva Labs in the mail.I did warn them: when I do a review, I am ALWAYS honest. No sugar coating... if somethings a dud, it's a dud, sorry.No worries: THIS IS A WINNER!Here are my test results:1) The ""Sniff Test"".  First thing when I opened the jar was the most fresh, fragrant coconut smell. Nothing slightly ""off"", like I've experienced from a couple of other brands (and well known ones, at that!).2) The ""Taste Test"". I dove right in, and plopped a little blob right into my mouth: fresh, clean VERY mild tasting, and NO gag reflex. Sorry, but I've had that reaction to those ""other"" brands. Like they were old, or a tad bit rancid or something. Not this one. Fresh from the coconut tree, thank you very much.3) Now for the ""Pet Test"". Yes, I feed a tiny bit each day to my Kitties and Mini-Schnauzer. A very tiny lick each, and they all are lively, healthy, shiny coated, with fresh breath. Yep: it passed the Lick Test. They love it.4) Next, the ""Beauty Test"". Yeppers, I even use coconut oil on my face. I'm not a spring chicken, but coconut oil gives me the facial skin of one. ;-)  But some brands have that ""off"" smell, and feel kinda greasy. This one was great to use! The fragrance doesn't linger too long, so you don't go around smelling like a tropical island, but it soaks into clean skin fast, leaving it soft, silky and NOT greasy. It only takes a little bit, too. Really... you just have to try it.5) Now for the ""Cooking Test"". I was a little leery of this one, since I actually do NOT like to cook with coconut oils that have a strong coconut flavor. After awhile, you get mighty tired of everything tasting of coconuts. But not to worry, it was pretty mild. I could barely detect the flavor of coconut oil. Even though my frying pan is supposed to be non-stick (one of those healthy green coated kinds), it still works better with a dab of ghee or coconut oil. Besides, coconut oil is GOOD for you, it handles the heat of sauteing, and is supposed to slightly speed up metabolism to aid in losing weight, among other things. So, passed the cooking test alright.6) The ""bullet proof coffee test"". Sorry... nuthin in the world can help me there. I just can't choke down coffee with ANY brand of coconut oil floating on top like an oil spill. That's not the coconut oils fault... it's my gag reflex. Guess I'm a coffee snob, but give me ""real"" coffee with cream and stevia, thank you very much.Overall, I really enjoyed trying this brand of coconut oil. It was a positive experience, and I would definitely use this brand again. I had never heard of it before, so am glad it's on Amazon. Highly recommend!PS: at the time of this review, I noticed a different supplier selling this same brand and size jar for about $80!!  Ridiculous! So be careful who you order from.",5
"I ordered this for my significant other.  She loves it, she has used it for hair conditioning, makeup removal, and I have used it for cooking. It seems like the real deal to us and it comes exactly as described. If you want a real treat try sauteing some shrimp or caramelizing onions with it, they both have come out great! This was the second coconut oil that I tried and I have to say I will be ordering it it again.",5
"I am very impressed with the Viva coconut oil.  I use coconut oil for many things; including in my deep fryer.  It doesn't start to get that ""old"" smell, even after several uses, and it browns beautifully.  The Viva does have a slightly stronger  (but delightful) fragrance, as other reviewers have mentioned, but it doesn't linger or affect the food it is cooked with.  The label says that it can be heated up to 350 degrees.  Fortunately, I didn't read that part before I used it.  I used it as the ""fat"" in my Southern Cornbread recipe, which bakes at 375 degrees.  Also used it to grease the pans.  No problem whatsoever.  I am also certain that frying a pork chop in the oil was a bit above 350 degrees.  I have to say that I like the consistency of this oil very well.  It's also great on my hair (Which is very dry) as well as on my skin.  Altogether, I have to rate it even above Nutiva.  I'm very glad to hear that a larger size will be coming out soon!",5
"I received a sample of this coconut oil from Viva Labs to give it a try. I had not used coconut oil before in any capacity but the list of uses on Amazon and online were marvelous and intriguing enough for me to accept the sample. It has a beautiful coconut smell there is NO chemical smell at all, it is a wonderful texture and my husband (who is the cook in the house) has been using it as a substitute for cooking oil with breaded chicken and pork. The food comes out a golden color and has a slight tropical taste that is delicious.I noted the dietary supplement option and did taste it as such and it is an oil so you have to be prepared for the filmy taste all oils have but otherwise it was not bad at all, there was a coconut flavor but it was not overpowering but also not all that present either. I would recommend this product to those interested in a cooking substitute and if you are interested in a dietary supplement, but I think its cooking purposes are more versatile.My review is in no way influenced by the fact that a sample was obtained. I would in the future purchase this product.",4
I love this item. I have sensitive skin that's also really dry and this oil was not sticky when I apply it on my skin.  It makes my skin really soft.,5
"I generally use coconut oil in my soap making. I buy 20 lbs at a whack from a wholesale company that sells organic oils. I always thought their oils were much nicer oils than those I occasionally buy ""on the cheap"" at Costco or other retailers. This product, however, is definitely the highest quality that I have used-- far too nice to use with lye and turn into soap. This is definitely food-quality oil and works well cooking anything you generally cook with other food-grade oils. I used it on my electric griddle to make french toast and it adds a subtle and slightly sweet flavor to the finished food.I think as more people are exposed to alternative oils like coconut, particularly for cooking, they will be pleased with the way their food tastes. I think the quality of Viva Lab's coconut oil is one that I feel good about eating and serving to others.Viva Labs provided me with a free sample for review.",5
"This coconut oil is the real deal. The aroma is so sweet and pleasant. I recommend this product. It's amazing! I purchased it to use in my homemade body butter, on my hair & to cook with it.",5
"Because of skin and food allergies, I've used several coconut oils. So when Viva Labs sent me their ""Extra Virgin"" version, I figured it wouldn't taste or feel much different than any other oil and that the slightly higher cost probably wouldn't be worth it. But I was honestly and truly wrong.This oil even smells better than most, especially when I rub it into my skin. Because it is ""Extra Virgin,"" it has a stronger coconut taste than most other oils, but it isn't overtly noticeable. It also bakes a lot better than most other oils. I used it in a batch of chocolate chip cookies for a party, and everyone raved about how good they tasted--even before they knew I didn't use butter and also substituted whole wheat flour for regular white flour. And days later, when my whole wheat cookies are usually crumbling, these were still moist and holding together.I am not a vegan, nor am I usually focused on buying organic items. My big concern is finding work-arounds for my dairy and corn allergies. I simply look for quality deals at a reasonable price. And this product is worth the cost.",5
"Being vegan, I'm always trying new things for cooking and baking. I've been dubious of coconut oils as some brands/types can leave a coconut flavor in the food, which isn't necessarily bad, but depending on the food isn't necessarily good, either.  So, to try it out, I wanted to put it in something that wouldn't be ruined if it tasted like coconut.The day after I received this oil, I used 4 oz of it as a substitute for butter in Banana Bread. Came out fantastic! There was no trace of coconut taste, and the loaf was as moist and tasty as ever.  So I tried it again, but this time in some fried potatoes and veggies. This was exactly the type of dish that would be ruined if it came out tasting like coconuts.  It didn't. Not a trace. Fantastic! Worked well too. Normally I'd use olive oil for that, but this coconut oil worked great.This oil has changed my mind completely about cooking with coconut oil. I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you've tried other oils in the past and weren't happy with them.",5
"The Health Benefits of Coconut Oils is Amazing!After researching and looking at all the health benefits that coconut oil have I had to try this product. It is said that Coconut Oil has unique combination of fatty acids with powerful medicinal properties, populations that eat a lot of coconut are among the healthiest people on the planet, it increases your energy expenditure helping burn more fat, it boost your immune system, it kills hunger and makes you eat less, and improves your blood cholesterol and many more. The list could keep going.Most clients and blog followers of mine, know that I am always looking for ways to help teach others healthy cooking ideas and give honest reviews. So here goes...Yes, I would recommend this wonderful product. The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell. It smells just like a Mounds candy bar .It has just the yummiest aroma about it.  Of course, after opening the jar and smelling it, I had to try it on my hands. I Love it!  It made my hand look and feel silky soft.  I thought to myself ""I will love to use it on my hands before washing dishes."" Being a chef and washing dishes as much as I do while I cook (no I don't have a dishwasher, it is just me) my hands can get dry. You simply can't put on gloves each time you wash a dish, while cooking, it is just not possible, it slows me down too much. So my hands normally suffer. So, that was the next test, and do, you know I love using this product right off the bat! On my hands, it holds in my natural oil and repeals water. Wow! I was amazed. I could wash dishes after cooking all day and my hands were still silky soft. I will have to try this product in my other beauty regimen. Maybe try it on my hair, body, and face next... Will keep you posted.See my blog for more recipes ideas  http://www.theartofcuisine.com/apps/blog/show/33548605-the-health-benefits-of-coconut-oils-is-amazing-Next, I used it to try a simple healthy recipe that even my kids loved.Oatmeal - The Heart Friendly BreakfastI like the old-fashioned oats as they have a fuller flavor and are healthier.

"I am highly impressed with this coconut oil - it was love at first smell! I used this particular brand/product for my body, not for cooking purposes. I have used it religiously for the past couple weeks when getting out of the shower, and I've noticed an improvement in my skin's dryness. I also slather it on my face and it does not make me oily at all. One of my favorite things about this particular coconut oil is that I love the texture, especially how it firms back up when under cooler temperatures. With other coconut oils I feel like once it melts, it returns to a bit of a waxy state, but this particular brand did not. It smells great, feels great on my skin, & is overall just a wonderful product. I'm hooked!",5
"I've been following the paleo diet/lifestyle for almost 7 months now and can't recommend it highly enough.As a quick side note, I highly recommend the following two books: Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health and Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life, they both helped me change my life.  I've lost about 40 pounds and gained muscle and feel amazingly better, both physically and mentally.Enter coconut oil.Coconut oil was recommended to me by various authors (some paleo, some general nutritionists) for the following functions:  cooking, butter substitute, frying, hair, skin and oil pulling.Oil pulling is the weirdest one, you put a tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth and swish it around for 20 minutes and then spit it out.  It's supposed to do wonders for removing toxins and for general teeth/gum health.Anyway, the consistency and  smoothness of this product was first rate when used for oil pulling.I've used it combined with some ghee for frying veggies and eggs and on some popcorn (yes, popcorn is my big paleo cheat) and it works great.I wasn't sure if there were any differences between this and my normal coconut oil besides consistency, so I asked my girlfriend to try it and she exclaimed right away the smell was different than my normal oil.  And sure enough, several other reviewers noticed this as well.  I smelled and tasted this oil along side my normal oil and sure enough, it's a bit different in consistency and taste.I like all the claims about organic, non-gmo, and so forth, I'm going to assume that most coconut oils come from similar places (I think the Philippines probably leads the pack, this is where my normal oil comes from), so it really comes down to processing and the care that goes into it.  I give this product 5 stars in that department.Like several other reviewers, I was given a free sample to try at home, which I was more than willing to do being an avid fan of coconut oil.I do put it in my hair on a regular basis and apply it to rough spots on my body like my elbows and I will sometimes lightly coat my face before going to bed with it.  It seems to be a really great skin and hair product, and being totally natural, I think it's the place to start before using chemicals.Oh, one more thing, I drink a green smoothie nearly everyday using this Vibrant Health - Maximum Vibrance - 24.81 oz. with a few things added, sunflower ""milk"", ice, some raw eggs, some nuts, some fruit like blueberries, sometimes a bit of kale and always a tablespoon of coconut oil.Now, it's hard to say exactly what does what, I also use fish oil on a daily basis, however I don't add that to the smoothie as it ruins the flavor, as where the coconut oil enhances the flavor, so it's hard to say exactly what health benefits I am getting from the coconut oil over say the fish oil or the other vitamins and supplements, but I am confident that coconut oil is very beneficial to my health and I intend to continue using it on a daily basis, that is from all the reading I've done about coconut oil in general.As far as this specific product:I do recommend it and feel it's first rate.",5
"I have tried coconut oil before, but my results were so so. The kind that I had bought from a store was really hard, and I had to pry it out and melt it. It also was expeller pressed which I think had a major difference in its quality and how it performed on my skin and hair. It was organic, but it was also refined. I like using all natural products to solve my skin and hair needs and had always heard how great coconut oil was for these purposes. When I received this coconut oil in the mail, I immediately opened it to see if it was the same hard stuff that I had gotten before with the other brand. I was so happy to see that it wasn't. Not saying it flows like a lotion or anything, but I could get it out easily. It also has a beautiful smell that the other kind didn't. I tried it on my horribly dry feet and hands, and they felt so much better after I used this coconut oil. I continued to use it on my dry skin, and my skin hasn't been this smooth in years! Next was to test how well it performed on my hair. I applied the coconut oil all over my hair except my roots, wrapped it up with a plastic bag, then wrapped it up with a hot towel. I left this on for about an hour then rinsed it all out. I could tell a difference in that my hair did feel more smooth and there was less frizz. I plan to do this about once a week now :)I haven't tried it with cooking or anything, but I do know of a study of coconut oil and alzheimer's. Alzheimer's runs in my husband's family, so the ones effected have been seeking methods to help with it. It has been shown that coconut oil has helped people with alzheimer's. I saw on Discovery Health once about a woman whose husband had alzheimer's pretty badly. She decided to try the coconut oil approach to see if it would help him. There was one point where she had him draw a clock, and the clock was completely unrecognizable. After a time of cooking with coconut oil, taking coconut oil supplements etc., the drawings of the clock continued to improve. Now, I am no doctor, but I do know that coconut oil is helping my husband's great aunt in her struggle with alzheimer's. Seems like coconut oil can not only help with the body on the outside, but may be able to help heal the inside.I received this product for my honest review. This is my opinion after receiving and testing this product myself.",5
I usually use Nature's Way EV Organic Coconut Oil but decided to try Viva Labs EV organic Coconut Oil. This coconut oil has more of a slightly nutty coconut flavor than Nature's Way which tastes like just a bland oil. Both have the same lightness. I have also tried Trader Joe's coconut oil but found it felt like a heavy bomb in my stomach. My favorite use for coconut oil is to put it on my gluten free toast with a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top of that! I also like to add 1 T of coconut oil in my Caffix (or coffee if that's your pref) with goat's milk then add some coconut sugar to sweeten. Finally then whip it with a wire whisk (just rub the whisk handle between your hands like you are starting a stick fire!) then it froths like a rich cappuccino!,5
"Like a lot of other people, I've jumped on the coconut oil band wagon and use it for all sorts of things, from conditioning my hair, to moisturizing my skin, to cooking.Since receiving my jar of Viva organic extra virgin coconut oil, I've used it for all of the above purposed with fabulous results.  I love the fact that it is organic and I like that it hasn't been overly processed.I prefer the texture of this oil to the others that I have used, especially for my hair and skin.  It's hard to explain why but it just feels better to me.  It's not as grainy.It still has a pretty good scent and taste of coconuts so if you use it to cook, there is no mistaken that you've used coconut oil.Overall, for the price, I'd say this is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it.I received a sample for review.",5
"I've used coconut oil for a while now, for everything from hair conditioning to skin care and even putting it in my tea (and protein shakes) from time to time. It's also great for cooking - it's a much healthier alternative to other cooking oils, and provides vital nutrients. In short, it's just an awesome product that has many uses.For those that don't know, coconut oil melts at roughly 76 degrees, so be careful when opening it on a hot day. It melts rather quickly just sitting in the palm of your hand, and spreads easily on the skin. As long as you don't use too much, it doesn't leave a gross residue or anything. I recommend putting a bit in your hair about an hour before showering - it will really help with dry, damaged hair and possibly with dandruff. It really replenishes your hair and leaves it nice and shiny and healthy.Overall, this is one of the best organic, unrefined coconut oils I've used, and I highly recommend it.",5
"Viva's Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is excellent for cooking, for taking internally, for oil pulling, and for skin care.  Spelling slightly of coconuts, my just oiled hands call the pets to lick it off.I use this oil for sauteing instead of olive oil because it does not smoke when I heat it to high heat while olive oil will burn easily at high temperatures.  I have also used this coconut oil when making brownies.  The slight coconut scent is just barely noticeable after cooking and makes these brownies memorable.I have not tried this oil on my hair, but on skin, it's great!  I use it daily on hands and feet.  It soaks into skin quickly and leaves it feeling supple.Viva's coconut oil contains only small amounts of medium chain triglycerides, so if you are attempting to increase the amount of those in your diet, this oil will not be what you want.  MCT oil is available on Amazon.com.I have used Viva Labs products in the past and found them to be as good or better than any other similar products from other manufacturers, so I have developed trust in products from Viva.  This coconut oil has so far been as good or better than other coconut oils I have used, and, with so many uses for this product, I like to have an extra jar on hand. I highly recommend this particular oil.Five Stars!",5
"When I first discovered coconut oil, I picked up an organic jar from the grocery store - however, I wasn't impressed and didn't find it to be the miraculous product everyone had claimed.  In fact, it didn't even smell like coconut.  After some label inspection, I discovered it was refined and therein lied the problem.  I embarked on a mission to find a truly organic, unrefined, extra virgin coconut oil.Which brought me to Nature's Way EfaGold. Organic, Pure Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 32-Ounce Jar.  Finally I understood why everyone was nuts for coconut oil!  I started off using it in a few recipes and even tried it as a luxurious lotion.  Then I began to use it in baking, which is when I really fell in love.  I was amazed with its ability to completely substitute for butter.  Now I use coconut oil for everything from cooking, baking, topping, cosmetics.Viva Labs contacted me with this product and told me I wouldn't be disappointed.  A cocoNUT convert, I eagerly hopped on the opportunity to try it.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the jar was the delicious coconut aroma.  That's how I knew it was the real deal.  But would it pass the taste test?That night, I put two tablespoons in my popcorn popper.  Result?  Delicious, buttery corn!The next day, I made a cake and when it came time for the frosting, I subbed out the butter for an equal amount of coconut oil.  The result?  Rich, creamy, mouth-watering frosting, with just a hint of coconut.A couple of days later, I made chocolate chip cookies and again, subbed out the butter for coconut oil.  The result?  You guessed it: nummy cookie goodness!I used it in a sea scallop saute.  I spread it on toast for breakfast.  I put it on waffles.  I put this coconut oil through every test in my house and it passed all with flying colors.  I'm hooked!For me, the only con is that it is only available in a 15 oz. tub.  As you can imagine, I use a lot of coconut oil in the kitchen and a 32 oz. container not only makes it easier for me to get a measuring cup inside, but it also creates less waste.  I'd love to see it become available in a larger size.",5
"Worth a try if your palms and heels are cracking. Only 1 ingredient listed; smell is rather mild. Solid at 70 degrees but quickly liquifies, then disappears when applied to skin; liquid when warmed just a little: can be used on any part of body. Try on your worst dry or chapped areas.",5
"With so many brands of coconut oil to choose from, I based my decision to buy Viva Labs based on the reviews and the price point. I have to say, I am very impressed. I use this product both in the kitchen, and as an all-around beauty product. The kitchen uses are endless. This brand melts wonderfully, and isn't too overpowering in flavor. I use it to fry eggs for breakfast, in smoothies, and in my coffee, and love the extra depth of flavor this product adds. I have yet to bake with it, but judging from how it has preformed elsewhere, I'm sure it will be great. As far as using this on the skin/hair- I love it! Right after I got this product, I had a pretty bad sunburn. This soothed my skin, and has proven to be a better lotion than the pricey ones I am sometimes inclined to buy. My skin is also ultra-sensitive. I have used this on my face a night twice, and both times I have woken up with bright skin, many of my breakouts were cleared up, and the surface of my skin looked and felt smoother. This product is truly a must-have for any kitchen or bathroom. From hair masks to baking cookies and cakes, the uses are literally endless.I will say that there is a distinct coconut smell that may transfer onto clothes or sheets. I don't mind this because coconut is one of my favorite scents, and the smell tends to dissipate quickly, but just one thing to keep in mind when purchasing this product. Other than that, I cant recommend this product enough!",5
"I decided to find out what all fuss was with benefits of coconut oil.  This product is good quality and good price.  I have been using it to add to smoothies, for my hair and plan to try ""oil pulling"".  I'm sure I will be ordering again.",5
"I purchased Coconut Oil, as I read of the many health benefits it provides. I specifically purchased it to use for oil pulling, which naturally whitens your teeth. I look forward to a brighter smile! :)",5
"I use it for my hair and skin, it smells so good! I also have started to use it for oil pulling. Very happy with my purchase!",5
"This is by far the best coconut product I have found.  I have multiple allergy and skin problems and have tried multiple products.  Although the other coconut oils were in  the most part satisfactory this product is appears to be the best.  It is gluten free, follows USDA ,standards and is BPA free.",5
My wife and I cook with this oil and our food doesn't need seasoning!  She isn't a big fan of coconut but she uses it for everything!  This oil can be used on your hair to give it shine and bring it's health back.  I recommend this!,5
"This is real coconut oil, if that is what you need. Smells great and you can use for everything. For food, hair or skin. I loved it",5
"I love this product and the price was great!!  I checked around and this was exactly what I wanted,great deal!",5
"I purchased this product to use in hair and skin treatments, and so far it has been great! I use it as part of my regular hair mask, but since it's all natural and organic, it needs to be warmed up a little in order to melt and work as a carrier oil to be mixed with other products. I've also used it for cooking several times.",5
"IT IS AWESOME. doesn't smell too strongly of coconut either. Warning: it's pretty hard inside, so i just let some hot water run over it.",5
Good stuff. Perfect for my dry hands. I put this on my hands at night and wear a pair of gloves to bed. When I wake up my hands are healthier looking.,5
Came right on time and is very nice quality and consistency.  I just started using it and I am very happy with it so far.,4
"I use this coconut oil as a daily facial moisturizer as well as a body moisturizer.  Its best when you apply it to damp skin after getting out of the shower.  What I love about it is how is keeps me moisturized throughout the day without having to reapply lotion.  Lotion makes your skin dry after a while since its first ingredient is water.  I'm on a journey to all things natural and after I read about the benefits coconut oil has on your skin, I decided to switch.  I'll never buy lotion or facial moisturizers again.",5
"Fantastic stuff, I have only used it for cooking so far, but it made for some great pancakes. I can't wait to discover more uses for coconut oil.",5
"The coconut oil is the most effective solution to everything. I've cooked eggs and turkey bacon with the oil and it came out with such a light oily flavor. Also, I use it on my hair and body. For my body, it makes my skin to shine with moisture along with clearing up any spots and marks on all areas. It has such a light feel. For my hair, it's great to lock in the moisture. I will definitely continue to buy more! Also, the coconut oil is wonderful for oil pulling which is a process to whiten your teeth and clear the toxins from your mouth. Thanx Viva Labs!",5
"I had a hard time finding coconut oil where I live so I had to order it from Amazon and I couldn't be more happy I did, this meet my expectations and it's just amazing. I use it for my hair and sometimes in recipes and it works perfectly fine.",5
"My trainer first told me a about using coconut oil. He had it right on all accounts. Whether for chapped lips, dry skin or cooking dinner, coconut oil is amazing. I was absolutely delighted with this purchase!",5
"I have naturally dry hair and did a lot of research on ways to improve it. This stuff is a miracle. The first time I used it, I followed instructions from an online video and covered my hair in it as well as my roots. I put a shower cap on and went to bed. I woke up, showered, and washed my hair really good. After my hair air dried...I cpuld tell how amazingly soft it was! Normally I have to put a lot of product in to make my hair manageable and temporarily soft. I legitimately used nothing...not one thing. After flat ironing my hair...I couldn't stop touching it. It felt so healthy and smooth. Since then, I've been putting a tiny bit in at night and brush it through and wrap it in a scarf. I wake up to beautifully soft and easy to manage hair every day.",5
"Great coconut oil. We use a lot of it at my house. We eat it and use it on our skin. Had been using a different brand that was good but was having shipping issues. Bought a different brand at the grocery store and it smelled rancid! This one has been great, and a good price too. I think I'll be sticking with this one going forward",5
"This coconut oil melts easily, has a nice smell, good flavor in cooked dishes, and excellent price. I will buy it again!",5
Very nice and useful and smelled nice thank you very much and sure i will order it again and again.,5
Great product! Fast shipping! Very good quality I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a healthy alternative to cooking with oil!,4
"This product arrived exactly as described. This oil is very ""clean"" - smells and tastes great. I purchased this product for ""oil pulling"" and it works very well.",5
I bought this oil to oil pull and so far I love the results.  My mouth seems cleaner and my TMJ hasnt been bothering me at all.  I have also used it to moisturize my body.  I havnet yet used it on my hair but plan to.For me to put it in my mouth straight it must be good!!!,5
"This is my first jar of Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  My previous jar of coconut oil can't even compare to the quality of the Viva Labs!  My previous jar brand shall remain nameless, lol!  The Viva Labs oil actually smells and tastes like coconut and the texture is so smooth!  I use this product for oil pulling and as a moisturizer.  I love it!",5
"Very concerned that I received basically rotten coconut oil that smelled like vomit.  Thankfully Amazon has refunded my purchase, but Viva Labs doesn't seem to care that a very bad batch of coconut oil is out there.  I tried calling customer service and the number did not work.  Then I emailed and got a form letter response that the matter was resolved.  Very disappointed and will not purchase from this particular company ever again.  Coconut oil that has gone bad can make you very ill, if you have purchased from this company and notice a strong rancid odor, please do not use it.",1
"It's pure!!!  I know coconut is the best thing for your skin, being a skin specialist. It's so healthy. I use it as a night cream. All over the face. Paying special attention to eyes and neck. No more wrinkles/ puffiness or dark circles. It's amazing !!!!",5
"I purchased this coconut oil for the process of ""pulling"" as well as for my hair and skin. I am in love. They shipped it very fast and it tastes and smells wonderful. I have no complaints!",5
This smells just like a bag of shredded coconut.I have used it on my dry winter skin. The house smells like a tropical paradise afterwards.,5
"Coconut Oil is great for so many things.  Of course, it is good for cooking.  But I also use it to make toothpaste, hand/foot scrub, deep hair conditioning, and sometimes as a moisturizer. Organic,Extra Virgin, and cold pressed coconut oil is always a good thing to have on hand.",5
"I love this extra virgin coconut oil. I have been using it as a moisturizer for my dry skin. It melts in my hands when I rub them together and goes on smoothly. I love the light, natural scent. I have also heated it in the microwave (10 seconds) and used it as a hot oil treatment for my hair. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a natural solution for dry skin and hair.",5
"Couldn't be happier with the purchase!  Not only has it worked great, but it arrived as described and I've had an extremely good customer experience with the company itself.  Definitely will be a return customer!",5
"I had never used coconut oil before but this seems to work the way it should.  I am trying it for oil pulling, I've only used it once but it looks like it worked fine.  It tasted fine so that was a good thing.",4
"Love it ... had a problem with dry, burning skin and this worked to relieve it.  I used it in my hair, too.  Have not used it for cooking.",5
"I have just hopped on the Coconut Oil bandwagon, and let me tell you, it is everything they say it is. This stuff is the most incredible moisturizer/conditioner [though you have to shampoo it out, not just rinse] and the PERFECT oil for oil pulling. It has just a hint of coconut smell/flavor, and it melts really fast. I love it. The first Coconut oil I got was not organic and the difference between the two is astounding.",5
"Smells fresh, tastes fresh and my body considers it fresh too!I'm literally using it for everything with a frying pan, chicken tastes great roasted in this.I even put it in my hair overnight. Took a shower in the morning and good lord. My hair was shining like a goddess :D",5
"Smells great! I can't stop smelling it, it literally smells like coconut. Works great for oil-pulling and hair! It left my hair feeling moisturized and not dry or damaged, and with the teeth, it cleans so well, I don't floss anymore haha.",5
"I am using this for oil pulling & it works great. The taste isn't too strong so I don't gag on it. I highly recommend it for oil pulling, except it comes in solid form so you have to let it melt in your mouth before swishing. I haven't tried it for cooking, but I am sure it would be great.",5
"I started oil-pulling last week, and let me say, this oil smells and tastes AMAZING!  This is a great quality oil, and, for oil-pulling, works GREAT!  In one week, my teeth are significantly whiter, the edema (water retention) in my ankles has dramatically improved, and, believe it or not, I have lost weight without any changes to my diet (and with no exercise).  I will be buying this product again and again!",5
The product met all my expectations and beyond. Shipping was quick.  I have no complaints at all.  I would recommend to anyone.,5
I use this oil for oil pulling and even though it has no real taste it still taste great.  Its also good for skin and hair and I have been using it liberally all over.  It smells heavenly.,5
"I love this product so much, I plan to buy more when I finish it.  It taste just like fresh coconut!",5
"I bought this to improve the health of my teeth in conjunction with Vitamin D and Fermented Cod Liver Oil. I selected Viva Labs for it's top quality, organic production. I prefer this is my smoothies, but it is so delicious in oatmeal and on toast. It's even delicious plain! I have also noticed an improvement in the health of my hair and skin clarity since using this coconut oil. I occasionally rubbed it into my skin during the winter when it was dry, but I found that my dogs just tried to lick it off when I did. Love this product!",5
"Really good deal for the price. Exactly what I wanted. Perfect for baking, skincare, and other healthcare regimens. I would purchase again.",5
"This is an excellent quality coconut oil, excellent consistency and excellent taste, would recommend to all interested in a quality coconut oil",5
"After all the hype recently I thought I would give oil pulling a try, and have been pulling with this product for the last week. So far I have not noticed any miraculous results. My teeth seem to be slightly whiter and the process overall is fairly relaxing.",4
"By no means am I a coconut oil expert, but based on the price, packaging and delivery, this coconut oils is right on par with others that I have tried. I use it for everything - skin, smoothies, and cooking - with good results. I would definitely not hesitate to buy Viva Labs again.",5
"I use this every night on my face as a moisturizer. It gives me the perfect amount of moisture and definitely hydrates my skin. I have acne prone skin and this does not clog my pores. I think it actually has improved the complexion of my skin. I recommend this product to anyone! It is also great to put in your hair and use it as a hydrating mask for your hair and scalp. Organic Coconut oil also has a lot of great health benefits. This brand gives you a lot of product, and I know I will have it for awhile! Great buy!",5
"Tastes great, great for cooking,I use this instead of canola oil and sometime olive oil.I'm looking for it to help raise my HDL. Like the idea that it's organic too.",5
I got this specifically to use on my skin and nails. So far I absolutely love it! It smells amazing and the smell is light which I like. It takes a few minutes for it to fully absorb into your skin so it is a little oily at first. I love how soft it makes my skin and how healthy my skin feels,5
"I use this  alot with my cooking....and to take off my make-up!!  Great product, highly recommend, especially if you try to stay organic.",5
I love coconut oil. It is so beneficial to not only humans but pets! I use it for my dry arms and I also feed some to my dog to help with his skin and hair. It's amazing how many benefits it has!!! I ordered this and it came in the mail in a promptly time.,5
I thought this would be a little weird(I use it for oil pulling) and have a weird texture but it tastes just like coconut and it isn't slimy nor does it leave that annoying film. I've already started feeling the affects from it and it's just great stuff. Very pleased that I decided to go with this brand.,5
This was delivered promptly and is as described.  Their website also provides you with uses for this coconut oil.  I am using it primarily for pulling and have no problem working with the oil.,5
OMG I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COCONUT OIL I JUST MADE POPCORN WITH IT AND IT IS AWESOME!!! I USE THIS OIL FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING SPREAD ON MY BREAD AND BAGELS COOKING FANTASTIC FOR MY SKIN !!!BEST MOISTURIZER EVER !!! THIS IS A GREAT DISCOVERY FOR ME...,5
"First time using coconut oil and now it's my and my daughter's choice for moisturizer - fromlegs to and arms to face and lips. It smells wonderful, non irritating, and seems to be hypo-allergenicfor us both (we have had some allergic reactions to moisturizers in the past).  Will order this again -but not sure when, as it will last us a long time.",5
"I have been really happy with this coconut oil.  Not sure why I started using it but have been using it for ""oil pulling"".  I have found that my teeth are no longer sensitive to cold.  Not sure about the other benefits yet, I have only been doing this for a week, but for anyone that has hot/cold sensitivity, give it a try.",5
My reason for purchasing Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil was for hair and skin careJust discovered it's also benifitial for your Dental Health - Oil Pulling With Coconut Oil[...],5
"The quality and consistency of this product is outstanding.  I use it in many different ways ... diet and beauty regiment.  Thank you Viva Labs for a pure, organic, extra virgin oil.",5
"I decided to try this product as a new facial moisturizer and I'm absolutely in love! Started using it about 2 months ago and it don't think I'll ever go back to a chemical filled moisturizer again!  Smells great and I'm excited to try it for other beauty uses (like a hair treatment!). I'm also 7 month pregnant and have been using this product on my belly as a moisturizer and so far, no stretch marks! In love!",5
Even our puppy loves it . I could eat it with a spoon but I do put it in almost everything !,5
"Bought this for oil pulling (swishing oil in your mouth for 20 minutes) I bought it here because I live in a small town and our health food store carries a lot of the same stuff and jacks up the prices. It's cheap, it works, package came on time in good condition.",5
"I really love this coconut oil. It has a pleasant coconut scent (not all do) and silky smooth texture. I've used it for oil pulling, sauting, baking, shaving, as lotion, in a DIY antiseptic ointment recipe, to soften cradle cap, and a few other things.This is a great value, and I love how versatile it is. I always have one jar in use and another waiting as back-up.",5
This is great.  Works on everything it says it will work on.  I would buy it again when I am out.,5
My wife had problem with chaffing lips. She used this and actually works. It came in on time and the value is good.,4
"We have been using coconut oil for the past few months. We used a couple of cheaper brands from the local store and you can really tell the difference between cheap coconut oil and the Viva Labs brands. The texture, smell, and density is outstanding in the Viva coconut oil. We have lost weight using the coconut oil, it also has helped in our digestion process.",5
"I love this product. I don't think I've ever used anything more moisturizing. The smell is so pleasant, I rub it on my face every night!",5
"I purchased this product to make diaper cream for my children, although my experiment didn't work. I've been just using this as a lotion and I could see the positive affects within minutes. It felt great on my skin and cleared up my sons rash so quickly.The smell of this is amazing compared to some of the others I have tried and I love that it is organic, that always lets me know there isn't extra stuff added into it. This is definitely a great coconut oil for the cost and I would recommend it to others!",5
"I just started taking this item daily as a supplement, and I'm very impressed with the quality of the product.",5
"This was my first purchase of coconut oil and I am delighted with the product.  To date, I have used coconut oil  in baking chocolate chip cookies (part butter and part coconut oil) and also in frying chicken, and added  it as a flavoring when cooking vegetables such as kale.  Other uses include treatment for dry and unmanageable hair and dry skin cream.",5
"Fast shipping, Great staple product to have in your home. I use it in food as well as for my hair and skin.",5
"If anyone isn't using coconut oil, you're a fool.  Super healthy, and even great for dogs!  I give my dog a teaspoon with his breakfast and his coat quality improved a ton!",5
"Great price! delivers fast! Works great on my skin, great for stretch marks!! I recommend this product to every person!",5
"I chose the rating of 5 stars for the Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil - 16 oz because it is really a nice coconut product. I first used it to make several batches of light and fluffy popcorn then, because I had some on the spoon, rubbed the rest into the skin on my hands and forearms. Fabulous! Best moisturizer ever. There is a very light coconut smell, but it doesn't linger.  There is a nutty scent when used for cooking but not a coconut scent or flavor.",5
"Love this product. Great for skin and hair AND cooking !! . Also, can be used for 'pulling'.I also apply this to my lips and can smell and taste it - like a big cookie. It's also great as Aromatherapy, before or after a shower.I will continue to purchase this product. Thanks Viva Labs and Amazon !!",5
"I bought this on recommendation from my daughter, and I freely admit, she was right!  I use it on my face each night before bed, and the results include, softer, brighter, healthier looking skin.  I also started using it for ""oil pulling"" and already see whiter teeth.  This replaced so many items in my medicine cabinet that were useful for just one thing. I can now travel lighter and be healthier with one product.",5
Unless it comes out of a box or a can I don't cook!  I tried this for the first time last night on my face. Like sleeping on a tropical beach all night!!!  Aahhh!!  Nice soft skin this morning!,5
Love it...My skin loves it..Use it to brush my teeth.My teeth are so white!!!.It really good to cook with too.,5
"Recently, I have become interested in coconut oil as it has so many uses.  I am starting to oil pull and though I have not noticed any effects yet, this coconut oil is wonderful! I have amazon prime and it came 2 days after I ordered it very well packaged.  Thanks Viva Labs!",5
"I have tried a lot of Coconut Oil products and this by far is the best one I have come across on the market today.  It has a great consistency, is perfect in recipes and I love the way it makes my skin feel extra soft, conditions my hair and I have even tried oil pulling with very positive results.  As far as the oil pulling goes, it has not helped with aches and pains but my teeth are much whiter and I no longer have any gum/tooth pain. I love this product and its many uses.",5
"I am using this coconut oil for oil pulling, and the taste and texture are wonderful.  It seems like a really high quality product, and I'll buy it again - especially since I'll probably go through this quite quickly!  The taste is so good that I'm considering using it in baking to replace butter.",5
I bought this specifically for oil pulling! It is nice and smooth and worked perfectly. I will be purchasing again!,5
"This is a great product. I use it for ""oil pulling"" once daily and it is great for this purpose. Highly recommended.",5
This coconut oil is great.  The smell and taste is fantastic.  I also use it on my face and it is so smooth now.  I LOVE IT!!!!!,5
I just started eating paleo. I have used it for my morning eggs and so far works great. I'm excited to use it for more stuff soon.,5
Great price for a big jar. I use it for my skin and always love the glow coconut oil gives. I've never used it for cooking but decided to try it. I made a minestrone soup and came out so good. What I liked is that this oil is very light. Definitely recommend.,5
"After reading up a little on MCT's and their importance I asked myself how could I incorporate this into my daily regiment. I had read where one person had used this for cooking, but decided for that to just stick to olive oil for my omega's. I decided to add 1 tablespoonful to my coffee in the morning instead of creamer (which is not good for you). Now my  morning coffee smells like coconut, with a slight buttery taste.  Believe it or not this is pretty darn tasty. Try it and do something healthy every morning",4
"It's pretty straight forward. I use it for cooking and oil pulling, and it works well for both uses. No complaints.",5
It works well for everything. And it's nuts how much it changes consistence. Adds different flavor to dishes I've made for years. I enjoy it so far!,5
"It is a decent size for the prize compared to other places. Smells nice and tastes good! I add a spoonful to my coffee an hour before i eat breakfast or lunch and it has helped me lose weight and has cleared my acne pretty well. It is more moisturizing than anything i have ever used, this is some godly stuff. Just sipping it from my cup of coffee makes my lips moisture.",5
"This is my first use of coconut oil.  I really did want something with the coconut taste, and this is great.  So far, I have only used it in my morning coffee (delicious!!), but look forward to using it in more ways!",5
Very pleased with the quality of this product.  I've tried other coconut oils but this one is the easiest I've used for oil pulling.,5
"After searching and reviewing several (many) coconut oils, this is the one I bought.  A friend that has used Coconut Oil for a year saw this product on my counter and asked me where I got it. He was very impressed with the quality and price! I guess I lucked out and I will buy it again!",5
Not only does this oil smell good and feel good it dries very quickly and it does the job. Coconut oil and Kukui oil are excellent for whatever you need to moisturize,5
I have just started experiencing the benefits of Coconut Oil.  However from what I have experienced I love it.  My skin has cleared up some and I have been pulling oil for a little bit and my teeth are so much whiter.  I am excited to see what else I notice.  Project was shipped super fast and I received it a day early!,5
I started using this product for moisturizing my skin. It definitely gives me a better feeling afterwards. It is a feel good mosterizer,5
"I cook with this product and have found the taste of the food no different than the other cooking oil I use--which is a good thing. Same flavor minus the health issues. Would love, however, for the price of coconut oil to come down. It is a shame these products are super expensive when they are an excellent replacement out there for those products that wreak havoc on one's health. Looking forward to VIva Labs helping in the mission of making this product easily accessible to everyone through lower prices.",4
Good quality product at a competitive price. Very satisfied...and smells wonderful! I would definitely buy again and recommend to others!,5
"Recently read about oil pulling and thought I'd give it a try.  Only a day or two in.  Mouth definitely feels fresher, but need more time to experience further benefits.  Oddly, swishing with this product is not only non offensive, it's actually quite tasty.  I'd say give it a try!",4
I use this for everything. Has great taste and does wonders for dry skin. Will definitely be buying this again and again.,5
So far my dog loves it. He has severe allergies so I rub it on his dry skin and he takes a tablespoon a day. I have not used it long enough to see an improvement.We also have been using it for oil pulling (the new trend) and I can say it does taste better than the others we have tried. Not an overwhelming flavor. Light enough to be ok.,5
"I ordered this so that I could try oil pulling. So far, it's working. I love the flavor. also great on my skin.",4
"I've been using it for oil pulling for a week now and I have certainly noticed my mouth is fresher. My breath is much better and when I floss it no longer smells like death. I haven't noticed it curing anything else on me, but I'm happy enough with a cleaner mouth. Plus, it tastes great. I've been adding a spoonful to my oatmeal every morning.",5
"I have never had coconut oil before.  I did some research and decided on Viva Labs.  Their reviews were impressive.  It was shipped very quickly and was as described.  The aroma is amazing.  I cooked some chicken tenderloins in it and I was a little skeptical about the flavor because the aroma was great.  Not only was my chicken great, the house smelled like coconut.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I've already spread the word at work.  When this jar is empty I will be getting another one from the same company.",5
"great taste and consistency. Shipped fast for a good price, what more can you ask for? Great for cooking too!",5
Have not noticed any difference between this product and my last purchase of a different brand. I like it and it works well for my 15 months old who has mild eczema.,4
I put this on in the shower while still wet then blot dry with a bath towel.  I have skin allergies and I finally decided to try one ingredient instead of a bottle of many.  It is working for me.  I love the smell too.  It fades after a while.This is nice and smooth and just melts into your skin.,5
It's the first time I have tried coconut oil and I was not disappointed!! This seems like it is a very high quality oil!,5
"I bought this originally to try ""oil pulling"", which I have not yet done! What I have done is use this as a moisturizer. Oh, my, it is wonderful! Not greasy or too thick, it absorbs easily and yet your skin maintains its softness. I will eventually get around to the oil pulling.",5
"Using for oil pulling. So far so good. It helps greatly with halitosis and whitens teeth. Kills bacteria in the mouth supposedly. I let it melt in my mouth then swish for 20 minutes, wash my mouth out and go! no problem!",5
This product is so versatile from skincare to baking to everywhere in between! I love that it is organic and unrefined too.,5
"I tried this oil based on reviews.  It has a good flavor and texture.  It is not a really ""hard"" oil. In other words it's not hard to spoon out.  Excellent quality coconut oil!!!",5
"I got this oil with plans to oil pull, and maybe occasionally cook with. The oil has a very subtle coconut flavor (which I love). It is smooth and cooks well. I am looking for more recipes with which to use the oil.",5
"Product arrived promptly. Product is great, use mainly as body moisturizer.  Smells nice and even sampled a taste...tasted good.  Actually bought a second one for my daughter.",5
"I ordered this from Amazon this week and I couldn't be happier with the product. It has been great for cooking and for moisturizing my dry, winter hands. Coconut oil has so many great uses and this product is absolutely one of the better ones I have tried.",5
This is great coconut oil for a good price.  I love coconut oil because it has so many uses.  I'll definitely buy it again.,5
"I was a bit skeptical before purchasing this Coconut oil because it said, ""for cooking, skin, and hair.""  Really?I initially purchased this product for the purposes of feeding it to my dogs, to keep their coats shiny.But, oh boy, what a pleasant surprise!  I actually do use it for my skin, cooking, and, yes, I feed it to my dogs.The coconut oil does NOT leave your hands or face oily/greasy after applied.  It just gets absorbed quickly leaving your skin smelling wonderful and moisturized! If you haven't tried coconut oil, I strongly recommend!",4
I love this oil. Good for oil pulling. It's unrefined and organic. Happy with this purchase. My husband and son are oil pulling now. Our mouths feel healthier.,5
"This stuff tastes AMAHHHH-ZING! I just received it yesterday, and used it this morning for oil pulling. So tasty. I cannot wait to cook with it later!",5
"I like the plastic jar, in case I drop it:)  Also, the coconut oil is bright white, and tastes great!",5
We have switched from cooking with most oils to using coconut oil (it has a higher flash point and is healthier).  This one has a great taste and we will use it again.,5
A tablespoon a day is great for my system and it has nice flavor and I love coconut flavor (the real deal) anyway.,5
"This product is Okay, A little underwhelming for the price. I purchased it for Oil Pulling, and the Coconut Makes it bearable to have the oil in your mouth for 20 mins. I would recommend it for that purpose.",3
this is exactly what i was looking for. i use it for oil pulling and a moisurizer. it smells great too,5
I did not realize when I purchased this just how large the jar was going to be and it was worth every penny!  Great all natural product that can be used for so many things.  I use it as a moisturizer for the body and feet and it works wonders.  If you use a lot then it can get greasy but it will absorb over time so if you don't want the greasy feeling just use less. It is in solid form but once your hands are in it it dissolves nicely!,5
Pure and creamy Organic coconut oil at a very reasonable price.  Much less expensive than the other ones out there with all the great quality of Organic goodness!  I highly recommend it!,5
"I bought this product because it had one of the best prices, but I am very happy with the taste and quality as well. I am trying to use more coconut oil in my cooking and for a beauty product. I am happy that I will be able to do so with an affordable product.",5
"Great for cooking, as a lip balm, or as a hair conditioner. The odor is mild and far less than that of comparable products.",5
Great value for the price. This coconut oil is as good or better than others on Amazon and its organic! What more could you want?,5
"This coconut oil is the best!  There's no residue or aftertaste!  It's just all NATURAL goodness!  I use it for ""oil-pulling"" and cooking!  I highly recommend this product!",5
I purchased Viva Coconut Oil to perform oil pulling and it works wonderfully. It was a great taste and easily dissolves without leaving any residue. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great coconut oil.,5
"Used this product to treat itchy, dandruffy dog  coats. One tablespoon per day solved the problem and enhanced the shine and texture of their coats. Also tried in baking in place of butter very successfully. Selected brand for competetive price point.",4
"I had been shopping for coconut oil to use for a variety of reasons - from cooking to personal hygiene benefits.  The main requirements were that it be organic, and extra virgin, to avoid any impurities or questions about quality due to processing.  I stumbled upon Viva Labs after searching through different brands that Amazon had to offer.  The reviews were great, the product was exactly what I needed, and it had the best price for what it was offering that I could find anywhere, even just on the web search.  I had this within two days and couldn't be happier.  I purchased one for my girlfriend as well who is also new to coconut oil and happy to experiment with it's many uses and health benefits.I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good, simple, pure coconut oil!",5
I use it on my hair and it provide shine without a lot of buildup and grease. I love how supple it makes my skin feel. I recommend it.,5
This was my first experience with coconut oil and then I switched to another brand (still organic and extra virgin) which was a big mistake. will switch back to this. I use it as a lotion and before shower for conditioning and my skin and hair feels and smells great,5
"After reading many reviews,I ordered your product.Nine months ago I had total knee replacement,besides the recovery being difficult,I also have issues with scar tissue from this and other surgeries.This Coconut Oil has done wonders for my skin,and a little goes a long way!And Hey,It also tastes great to cook with!Many Thanks Amazon !",5
I started using coconut oil for the supposed mental benefit...no body likes a dumb old person...but have also started using it as a hand and body lotion during this extremely long and dry winter we are experiencing this year.  My massage therapist also uses coconut oil as a base for her massages...no smell and no stickiness.  Love it.,5
"I use this mainly as a moisturizer, and it works very well.  I've also used it on my hair (left it in for an hour then washed it out) and it leaves your hair soft and silky.  As other people have noted, it is a solid at room temp., but it doesn't take much to melt it.  It melts in your hand (I've also used the microwave).  It has a slight, pleasant (in my opinion) smell.",5
I love this coconut oil. It has the best flavor of any that I have used. I received it super fast.,5
"Just what I was looking for to oil pull for oral health and internal organs.  Received it quickly, and will purchase again.",5
"They product cam a day early and is awesome! My teeth are whiter, my skin is smoother and you just cant beat the price! Thanks so much!!",5

"Very good coconut oil for hair, Body, or even the oil pulling!awesome Product and pretty big container.Came very fast also",5
"I have nothing to add that the other thousand plus reviewers haven't already said, so I won't waste your time or my time by repeating the obvious.",5
"This is the first time I've purchased this brand of coconut oil. I am impressed with the ease of melting as I use it as a face moisturizer. I am also pleasantly surprised by the fragrance: it has a deeper coconut scent than previous brands I have purchased. I will use this for cooking purposes as well, but I am still finishing up a previous jar of coconut oil for that purpose.I will definitely purchase this brand again in the future.",5
1 week in to my supplement / oil pulling routine and I must say that the quality of this product is outstanding.,5
I really like the smell of this and the feel on my skin. It goes on easy and melts. nice feeling!,5
"A lot of people have been sleeping on coconut oil. My masseuse from Ghana told me about this and why I needed to use this. I am African American and this oil absorbs and moisturizes ethnic skin really well. I use this on my scalp before I officially wash my hair, and it has so much luster and sheen to it. I recently used this product to treat a yeast infection a week ago and, let me just say this gave me a LOT of relief with the itching externally and internally. I also take 1/4 a teaspoon of this daily in the morning to keep the good fats in my system. This product is a must have!",5
"you can eat,put on your body/face or hair. smell really good. 16oz about 10 dollars I think it's a pretty amazing product!",5
Extremely happy with this product...I just use this on my skin and have been happy with the results of better looking skin.,5
"I love it! It works well, and i have tried all kinds of different uses for it.  It also came in the mail on time and they provided me with what I ordered (did not seem tampered with and I did not notice anything out of the ordinary). Trustworthy sellers",5
"I've been reading about using organic extra virgin coconut oil for quite some time. However, the truth was I assumed that it was just the same as any other oil -- even vaseline. I stand corrected! First of all, the scent is amazingly fresh, clean and sweet. I love the smell of coconut. I've washed my face with this product several times already, massaging just a bit into my skin. A little goes a long way. Then, I used a face cloth with hot water and briskly cleaned my skin. It gave me a fresh look, but not dry or irritated. There was just enough moisure to allow my foundation to go on smoothly. Because I was careful to remove the excess coconut oil, I did not get an oily look on my face as the day went on, and my skin felt great.Incadentally, I thought my face was already clean when I applied the coconut oil, but more foundation came off on the cloth! Because this goes so far, I can imagine this 16 ounce jar lasting for months. After doing tons of housework, I massaged it into my cuticles with excellent results. It even seemed to improve my nails, preventing the annoying chipping at the edges I've been experiencing. Good stuff!",5
"She LOVES this stuff! Don't know why it's not my favorite smell. I might try cooking with it after reading about it's health benefits. Wonderful for cracked dry skin AND it's organic and cold pressed, perfect for my puppy to eat to help with her dry skin. And it has! Noticeable difference after only a week. Would and do recommend.",5
This is easily one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon. I use it as a moisturizer for my face and hair. Simply incredible product. Great for whitening teeth and suppressing hunger as well.,5
"I love Viva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut-I use it for a moisturizer for my face at night -  perfect for my elbows, hands and all areas of my body-The best of all it even handles my cracked heels of my feet-It's just a wonderful.  You must have Coconut Extra Virgin Oil in your home I can't live without it-Barbara Reboh Schader",5
"i mean really where can you go wrong with organic coconut oil, its awesome, and im sure i will order again, actually my mom-law order 2 containers also.Awesome sauce",5
"If you are one of those people who have joined the bandwagon on the coconut oil craze (as I have), this is a great brand.  I've tried others that have been grainier, which I know varies with brand, and even with batches of the same brand, but I loved what I got.  I primarily use it for skin care and make-up remover.  In the winter I can't stand how my skin feels once it starts to get itchy and dry, and it's nice to know that this stuff will soak in , stay with you all day, smells pleasant but not too strong, and is natural.  Love it!",5
"I have become a user of coconut oil in the last year.  I was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal problem, and have had to change many things in my life, including my diet.  I have found that avoiding certain foods and replacing them with healthier choices, I've been able to make life easier, and control my problem to a large degree.  Viva Coconut Oil is one of those changes; I've replaced all previously used oils for cooking and baking with this product, and with these results, I'll continue my healthy lifestyle.",4
"I highly recommend this product, my family loves using the coconut oil for so many different purposes from cooking to skin care.  The price was very reasonable and the shipping was super fast!  Also, they are going to donate $10 to Vitamin Angels, a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing child mortality worldwide by connecting infants and children with essential nutrients through vitamin supplementation. (which I thought was awesome!)",5
"I initially bought it to try out the oil-pulling method. I then discovered how many more ways I could use it. I've only done oil-pulling twice since I received it last week. Works fine for that, I personally just don't have the time/patience to swish it around for 15-20 minutes in the morning. I'll try again in the near future though. I did however use it for deep-conditioning. And I must say that my hair afterwards was super soft! I'll definitely use this for deep conditioning! In terms of other usages, it's all over online (and on the package) that it works for other things like removing make-up, as a body moisturizer, etc. So I do recommend this product!",5
Smells awesome. I use it all over for moisturizer. I apply it at night and it's lessened any redness on my face.,5
"Recently learned the benefits of Coconut Oil and am using it daily. It's a great skin moisturizer which I use both on my face and body and under eye. Plus it smells terrific. Haven't cooked with it yet, but I rarely cook! Coconut Oil sounds like the DOES EVERYTHING product (like Windex!) Hurry and buy it!",5
Worth it's price! Smells amazing and great texture. I will use it for a homemade body lotion and I'm really excited.,5
I use this as a moisturizer. I love the organic extra virgin type only for my skin. It is much better than regular.,5
"Coconut Oil is fantastic! The product arrived quickly in excellent condition. It's a white, not yellow oil. I love that it's organic and GMO free. The price is great! I highly recommend this product.",5
"Was bought for my GF and she loves it, wants more of it. Great size container for the price. Highly recommend it.",5
"I take a tablespoon a day for health reasons, and Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has a better flavor than the other Coconuts oils I've tried.",5
My first time using this product and I'm very happy with it. It's easy to use and full of flavor,5
"Love the way it feels on my skin, soft and smooth, not oily. Has a pleasant smell that does not linger so I can use other fragrances without a conflict.",5
I use it on my face since I have dry skin and it works great. I would definitely recommend it...,5
"I absolutely love this product. I use this for everything skin, hair, nails, pulling oil, & cooking. I will definitely be ordering this again. Fast quick delivery too. The light natural fragrance is by know means overwhelming. This is on my A list.",5
"I BOUGHT IT TO NUTRIENT MY HAIR, AND FOUND IT CAN USE AS BODY CREAM, AND EAT WITH BREAD! GOOD PRODUCT.",5
Chose the Viva Labs coconut oil over other brands based on the Amazon reviews. It does not disappoint. I use it for cooking and as a moisturizer.,5
"This product is lovely. The texture is great and it smells like coconut, not chemicals. Excellent to use in making lotions or on its own.",5
"My doctor recommended supplementing with coconut oil to help alleviate my high cholesterol.  I chose this based on other reviews, and was not at all disappointed.  It's incredibly delicious!  Even my kids are loving toast with the Viva Labs coconut oil instead of butter.  Love it!",5
"I decided on this brand because a vitamin I bought from them was sourced from Scotland rather than China where most suppliers are.  I used the coconut oil to make body butter, which turned out very well.  I""ll buy from this company again.",5
"I'm not much for writing reviews so I'll make it short and to the point. This stuff rocks my socks off! You can eat it, cook with it, slather it on your entire body, head to toe. You're hair will be silky, your skin as smooth as a baby's bootay and you'll be super healthy. What have you got tolose? Try it. The end.",5
We received the coconut oil quickly and we are very satisfied with the quality.Overall a we had very good experience.,5
Using coconut with my essential oils and also alone.  It is great for skin and has dozens of uses.  Love it as a carrier oil.,5
Feels lighter and tastes good too.  Use it for burgers and chicken and I can't complain.  Give it try and you won't be disappointed.,5
I received mine in plastic jars. Would rather prefer that the oil be packed in glass containers. Smells and taste good. I use it as a skin moisturizer for my body after shower and eat a tablespoon daily.,4
"Did not work as well on my hair, when I tried it on my skin it just made it greasy. I don't think I'll be purchasing a second bottle.",2
"Tasty and good.  Exactly what I paid for.  It has a very good consistency,, though it stays liquid at room temperatures (at least in my place)",5
"I had been wanting to try coconut oil but wasn't sure which product to choose. After a little research, I settled on Viva Labs and I am so happy with the product. It is great for moisturizing my dry skin. My hands were so dry the fingerprint scanner at work could not read my prints.  After just a week it was not a problem anymore.  It is wonderful in my morning coffee! It kinda just sits on top but it gives my coffe a delicious toasted coconut flavor and leaves my lips moisturized. Love it!",5
"I bought this with the intention of making my own eczema cream, but my skin didn't like the mix of ingredients I used. Instead, I have been using this in my hair as a mask.I apply it all throughout my dry hair and comb it through with a wide-toothed comb to make sure all strands are coated, and then wrap it into a bun. I let it sit for at least twenty minutes, then shampoo and condition as usual. It makes my hair incredibly silky, shiny, and healthy. I also use it on my face after my nightly skin care routine over top of my moisturizer and it really helps with skin elasticity. It hasn't clogged my pores at all, and that's saying something because my skin is very sensitive.Oh, and I've also melted it and mixed it with a little flour, milk, and seasonings as a chicken batter, and rubbed it on steaks with salt and pepper before cooking! And it goes great in smoothies. It really is a multipurpose staple.",5
"I love coconut oil i use it for my hair, skin, oil pulling, cooking and anything else i can come up with lol.  This one is probably my favorites and tastes the best!",5
I bought this oil about a week ago. It shipped quickly and arrived on the estimated date. I bought it to use for cooking and ersonal use. It did wonders to my hair!. I bleach it a lot and was having a little bit of breakage but the oil made it look and feel fantastic. I use it for cooking and I will never use anything else! It leaves a slight coconuty taste but nothing too overbearing. I used it to make an omelet for breakfast this morning. We eat all organic at myhouse and the viva labs oil has made its wayonto my grocery list. Love this oil!,5
I am very pleased with this product and will order again. I like the taste of the oil and plan on cooking with it.,4
"I was very satisfied with this coconut oil. Nice flavor, good price.I use it primarily for my bulldog. He has some allergy issues and applying a small dab to areas that appear on his skin really help them heal. He loves the taste as well. I give him a spoonful twice daily. It's great for his fur, nice & soft.I also use it for my nightly facial moisturizer and under the eye area eye cream. It's a great mascara remover, too.",5
"The BEST Coconut Oil around!! I absolutely love this product. GREAT PRICE for the freshest, sweetest, organic UNREFINED coconut oil I have been able to find. I use this to make toothpaste, lotion, and as a leave in conditioner and it works wonderfully for all those purposes. As soon as you open the lid, you can smell the sweet aroma of virgin coconut... Amazing! I will certainly be buying this product again and again.",5
I love my coconut oil moisturizer! i put it on every day after a shower. i love the scent and freshness it gives to my body. it is nice and smooth. highly recommend this!,5
"I've bought coconut oil before, but this smells so amazingly wonderful! I put this on my feet and legs before going to bed and keep some in a container in my purse so I can have it with me at all times. My hands feel wonderful. Even used it for oil pulling, the taste is amazing......thank you, I will purchase again!!!!",5
"I use this on my skin, just now used it to sautee the onions in my soup, and use it on my puppy's dry kibble to make it more palatable and to make his coat shiny.",5
"The flavor and aroma of this coconut oil is wonderful! I first decided to buy it to give to my dog, to help control his allergy related itchy skin. The oil helps with the itching and has made his coat lush and soft.I've been using it on my skin as a moisturizer because I like its fragrance and the purity of the product ( it's pure organic coconut oil). It feels great though a bit greasy so I towel off some of it. It's also great treatment for dry hair hair as well. I highly recommend Viva Lab's organic coconut oil for people AND their dogs!",5
Great product for hair and skin care!. It works better than any other lotion for dry skin. It is easy to use. I'm very pleased with this purchase.,5
"This product is as advertised, emidiettely its opened youGet a natural coconut scent. I use it  to maintain my hair naturallyWill recommend it without any hesitation.",5
"Maybe all of the coconut oils are this expensive, or maybe it's because it's ""organic"" and/or extra virgin, cold pressed.I liked the taste, use it on popcorn and pancakes but I haven't tried it in recipes yet.",4
"This Coconut Oil seems to fulfill the needs those needing it for cooking or for skin.  I have used it mostly for skin care, and it work as well as other lotions for dry skin--and the aroma gives you the sense of being at the beach.I don't see any reason for this product not to be the Coconut Oil of choice for consumers.  It is organic and extra virgin which is what I have seen to be recommended as optimum.",5
I whipped this up in a mixer and put in mason jars to use as facial moisturizer. Completely satisfied with this product.,5
"This is the first time I've used coconut oil so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but it smells amazing and works really well in the lotions I've been making.",5
"I bought this item for hand moisturizing purpose but, also found it best as a make-up remover including removing strong water proof mascara. I used to buy an expensive brand name remover but, no more!You massage the coconut oil all over the face and tissue off everything in the end. You still need to wash your face with face soap but my case, skin got much softer.",5
"It is okay, thought it would be nice, but it is nothing special. Makes my hair so oily even after washing!",2
"I've had the coconut oil for a few weeks and so far, I love it!  I'm pregnant and have been using the oil as a moisturizer on my belly and rest of body.  It makes my skin very soft and smooth.  The smell isn't too powerful so you're not walking around smelling like coconut all day.  I'm eager to try it for a moisturizer for breast feeding.",5
This is my first time purchasing my own coconut oil. I have been using it for everything and I love it!,5
"Great brand, I wanted an unrefined, unbleached, coconut oil and this was it. I use it in place of olive oil in my cooking and its great. I also use it as lotion after I take an exfoliating shower; either use directly or mix with vaseline and vitamin e oil, that and sleep in satin pajamas. You will wake up with the softest skin. I also use in my hair occasionally as a mask and it has worked wonders for me. I highly recommend to those looking for a natural oil/lotion substitute. I know I will be using this over the summer with aloe vera as an after sun care for my skin. Will be buying more soon!",5
"Very natural, it feels and smells great, it can be used for cooking or as a beauty product, totally worth it.",5
"Therapeutic results.  Cleared mental "" fog"" substantially.  Started on 2 tbs a day for 1 month.  Now on 1 tbs a day.  I put a tablespoon in my morning coffee, but it can also be taken with peanut butter or just plain ( though I don't prefer it plain -- has no taste, but I don't like the texture).  I highly recommend this product to improve mental clarity.",5
"I started using this as a facial moisturizer to get away from harsh, chemical filled lotions. This smells amazing, is USDA certified organic and is just simply amazing. It leaves my skin feeling extremely moisturized and looking vibrant! A little goes a long way, I'm so happy I found this!",5
This product was amazing on my hair and skin!!!  It makes a wonderful moisturizing hair mask.  You can also cook with it.,5
Coconut Oil is good for inside your body and skin.  Try it and you too will be a fan.Sarah G,5
"I've been using Viva Labs coconut oil for cooking and baking, and sometimes for beauty products. I like this better than some of the other coconut oils I've purchased in stores.It's a great product overall.",5
"Always happy with Viva Coconut Oil! We use it for hair and skin treatments, and it always works great for us.",5
"For the price - this is an amazing product and lots of quantity.  I was relaly happy with my oil and I use it for cooking, skin creams, hair, everything.",5
"First of all, when I opened up the jar the smell was incredible, just like a normal coconut smell. Second of all, the price and the shipping, when I ordered the shipment was expected to be completed in about 15 days, I was surprised a little but I still wanted to place the order, so I did and after just 5-6 days the shipment was complete and also it was free, I recieved it in just 2 days later from the shipment, Also I would like to mention that it is hard to find this in regular stores and the best place to get it is probably here, for 3 major reasons, 1st Price, 2nd Quality, 3rd Free shipping, that's all we need",5
love how versatile & natural this product is. I use it as a moisturiser & carrier for using essential oils.,5
"I have been using this oil on my skin for 2 weeks; it is difficult to get out of the jar but I like the way my skin feels after applying.  have tried most lotions and couldn't find one for my type of skin, very dry in the winter.  this oil seems to work......hasn't smoothed out the wrinkles but that's ok.",3
I use this oil as a moisturizer after showering and it's been working really well to keep my skin hydrated in the winter. Also use it as a lip balm - works great too.,5
"I loveeeee this. I saw it had great reviews and decided to give it a try. I use it for cooking, smoothies but best of all my hair. I apply about a tablespoon with a cotton ball on my scalp. Cover it and sleep with it on. I wash it in the morning. After a month of using it I've been receiving compliments on my hair left and right. I tried it several times as a moisturizer but its almost too greasy for my taste. Ordering this product again soon.",5
"Smells great tastes great. Used to make homemade deodorant. It is amazing, even my husband tried it. Also used to make brownies and as a carrier for essential oils. Awesome would buy again.",5
"texture is great, I use to cook with, put on as skin crme, hair conditioner, and smells wonderful...looking forward to some dessert recipies",5
"As described, I have red patches of eczema and dry skin on my face, it's a miracle for dry skin! Also works great for massages, and immediately softens dry skin on feet- apply lavishly, put on socks over night, and voila- better than a pedicure!",5
works good for dogs skin and coat. never tried it before. will buy again and want to try it for cooking.,5
"The smell is good but in fact is that it wasn't ""a miracle"" for my hairI use it during the night before washing my hair, wrap oiled hair ( only the length) in a food filmIt's easy to wash it off but I can't see any difference when I'm not using itMy hair - bleached with splited ends.I've also tried it as a skin moisturizer - it  works better than on my hair, but still no ""drama effect"" for me",3
"My wife and I have been moving to a natural diet and lifestyle, and the latest move was to get rid the Dove, shampoo and even lotion.  I am always up for a challenge, so we got coconut oil as a lotion substitute, and as a base for deodorant.  I have to say that my face has never been so well-balanced, in terms of being able to regulate it's moisture, as it is by using coconut oil instead of lotion after showers.The smell is amazing, but it doesn't last once the oil sinks in (I prefer not to smell like coconut all day anyway).  The taste is equally amazing; we have used it for popping popcorn and making chocolate so far.  So far, there's nothing this oil hasn't been able to do better than the chemicals it has replaced.  I like knowing that the moisturizer I use is healthy enough for me to eat, and that it actually tastes great!  Definitely recommend!",5
"This coconut oil is perfect.  Not the refined junk you get in the stores.  It's organic, pure, extra virgin, cold pressed and smells delicious.  It also comes in a huge container.  I put some in to a smaller container and put it in the diaper bag, some in the kitchen and some in my bathroom since I use it in all 3 places.  This jar gives you a ton and for a great price. Thanks again, I will definitely be coming back to you guys.",5
"This Coconut Oil is so good tasting and love cooking with it. Cook my husbands eggs and French toast with it and he doesn't know the difference,",5
"I love Coconut oil I used it from cooking,to my skin,hair,nails,instead of buying body lotion I mix it with essentials oils apply head to toe..instead of olive oil,I use coconut oil in cooking chicken and salmon.I like the fact that Viva gives back as well.",5
"I checked around for prices and this was a good value. Also it is organic which I liked, with good smell.",4
I use as a skin and hair conditioner and absolutely love it.  Definitely good value for the money.  Will purchase again when I run out.,5
This coconut oil has a light taste and works well for both cooking and applying to skin  I use it on my face and cook with it.  Very happy with it.,5
"I use coconut oil for my hair, skincare, and as a supplement.  I cook and bake with it, but I use Viva Labs  in my oatmeal or I eat it melted by itself, because I've learned how good it is to restore the balance of good and bad bacteria in my digestive system. It can be used for soooooo many things that I wish I had known about coconut oil sooner.  I also use it as a moisturizer and I add it to other things to care for my skin.  It makes your hair grow faster, when used as a hair mask.  I am thrilled with the changes that I am seeing since I added coconut oil to a healthy diet.  The price and shipping was great, I would definitely order this again.  :-)",5
After some seriously positive professional reviews I decided to try this product. I spread some on toast instead of butter. I tried this brand after reading all the positive reviews and stand in agreement that it is top quality. The overall benefits will take time to evaluate. The immediate results are that I feel full and satisfied; plus it tastes (subtly) excellent.,5
"I've been using this product for a while as part of my hair care regimen and I have to admit, I love the way that it leaves my hair! Soft, strong and beautiful! I also use it in cooking and the smell is just delicious. I will definitely purchase this again.",5

Bought this to help my dogs skin and coat improve. Saw results right away and he loved eating it every night.,5
I would have given this product 5 stars except that it's in a plastic jar ...  the plastic takes away flavor. ... otherwise it's pretty good.,4
I purchased this product because my clean was getting very irritated due to the chlorine levelin the gym pool.  Put this product on prior to getting in to pool and problem cleared up!Makes your skin feel so soft and not greasy!!,5
"Very nice. I slow cook my powdered decarbed flowers in a jelly jar with coconut oil, inside a pan with water on the stove.Cook for 2/3 hours, freeze, cook again for a little bit, freeze, defrost, and serve by the spoonful. You can keep it in the cupboard for months if you want.",5
This coconut oil is very smooth and delicious. I've used it for cooking and in my morning cup of coffee and it works great either way.,5
"I've actually used this for both cooking and a hair mask and it works equally well for both.  It has a delicate smell, but I barely noticed the taste in the food.",5
"I read the descrecption and comparrd it to the information online as to what is considered the best type of Coconut oil, and I decided to purchase it. Once I started using it, I immediately noticed why it was by far the best. It quickly soften my hair and immensley improved the look of my skin after just ONE use overnight. I didn't purchase this for cooking or baking but I can only imagine my food would taste greate as well!! I am in love with this product!! LOVE IT!!",5
You can tell that this is wonderful coconut oil just by the taste.  I can eat it raw by the spoonful and the taste is heavenly.  I just wish it came in a glass jar.,5
My favorite brand of coconut oil by far. Good value and lovely coconut aroma. No need to look further - buy this one!,5
I've never seen or touched coconut oil before but this is great stuff. I used it to make homemade deodorant. I didn't have to add any essential oils and the mixture smells lightly of coconut even after all day.,4
"I bought this product after reading about how it could help with digestive issues and canker sores, and within days, I saw major improvements in my overall health.  Five weeks later and I have no had one canker sore and my digestive system has never been better.  Highly recommended.",5
"Great product that I now use for everything (cooking, baking, skin health,etc.). No more other oils or EVOO being used anymore!!",5
"OMG!! I love love this stuff. I use it on my hair. I put it on once a week before bed comb it and pull it back. It's the best thing i have ever used for my hair. I have used a lot. I don't know why or how but it smoothes my dry damaged ends, and hydrates my wavy hair. I wash my hair the next day and it looks fab. I will never stop using this stuff!!",5
"I wanted to get the best coconut oil and thanks to the reviewers and Amazon, I believe I found it. This product is pure, delicious and there are so many uses for it, I am still amazed. I purchased it for cooking, as well as the health benefits and I have not been disappointed. It is a solid at room temperature and quickly melts at body heat level. It makes a great moisturizer and superb for dry hair. Multitask? What else could you ask for in a product?",5
"I love this coconut oil, it does such a great job with moisturizing my hair.  My hair had never been so soft, this is worth the money.",5
"This jar of coconut oil looks better than Snow White, glittering and translucent get rid of is appeared, add hot water, aroma overflowing the whole room, my family like it very much.",5
Smells great! Works great for hair and skin. I mix this with shea butter and castor oil and use for my hair and skin.,5
"Last year I had a strange rash on my shin.  I tried cortizone, neosporin, steriod cream and other lotions with no success.  Then a friend suggested I try Coconut Oil.  Within a matter of days from starting to use the Coconut Oil the rash started disappearing.  Now I very rarely use any other body lotion.  Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is the 4th different brand I have tried since I started using Coconut Oil.  It is by far top quality.  I am allergic to perfume, this oil has a very faint pleasant smell that does not trigger my allergies.  It moisturizes and absorbs better than any other moisturizer I have ever used.  It may seem like it's going on greasy, but it absorbs quickly without clogging pores.  It's great for the whole body, even dry feet.  Highly recommend this product.",5
"This coconut oil is awesome! I destroyed my hair with the baking soda shampoo, vinegar rinse combo, and the only thing that helped was this oil. It is natural, no artificial anything, and it brought the moisture back into my hair. I also use it as a shaving oil on occasion and I have gotten complemented on how smooth my legs are. I even baked with it (I separated it out prior to using it for cosmetic purposes.) This stuff is great!",5
"I use it mostly as a spread in place of butter. 'Love it on my toast every morning. Very mild, pleasant flavor",5
"I use this for everything, except cooking.  You can put coconut oil virtually anywhere !  I think this is a good quality product, just don't wash or spit it down the sink.",5
"Truthfully I was concerned about buying a flavored version of this product.  However this stuff absolutely rocks! I cook with it, I eat by the spoonful when I am hungry and the feeling just goes away?  Like it a Bunch!",5
"This coconut oil is very smooth in taste and texture.  I've used it in cooking, but have also just taken it off a spoon as a supplement.  I would recommend this particular coconut oil for those who take a proactive approach to their health.",5
Yep. Loved the product.. This is the SECOND review I've written because they just keep spamming my email for a review... Does great on my skin and my dogs (hairless dog) and great as a supplement for skin/nails/hair in both dogs and people... That's about it.. Here's hoping they'll stop spamming me.,4
"I didn't know just how many health benefits there are to organic coconut oil!  Amazing stuff!  And then the applications for skin and hair make it that much more of a bargain.  The price, shipping, and product are excellent!",5
"This  coconut oil is pure, organic and of superior quality. I love the versatility of this product.  I have used it for cooking/baking and even in my morning coffee.  It has a nice aroma and exceptional flavor.  I also use it on my skin as a moisturizer and even as a make up remover.  It is also the best natural hot oil home remedy I have tried.  I heat a couple tablespoons of coconut oil and apply it to my hair. I wrap my hair in a towel and leave the oil in for an hour. Then I rinse it off in the shower. I have tried other coconut oils in the past and this is by far my favorite one. I highly recommend it!",5
I would highly recommend this product. I use it as a moisturizer on my hair and face! It works great.,5
"This oil has a mild flavor, and comes in an easily opened container which is also easy to dispense from.",5
I use coconut oil in my cooking.  Viva Labs Organic has a great consistency and it's the best tasting I have tried!  I really love it!  I'm about to order more.  :),5
"Loving this product, use it daily for myself and my son for our bodies, not just for cooking! Thank you for the great deals!!",5
"I received my product on time, no problems with Viva Labs.  I am fairly new to using coconut oil on my skin as a moisturizer, so far I do not like my skin's response. It does not make any sense, but I feel like my  skin is left very dry at the end. I would like to know if anyone else had the same problem. I usually apply it all over my skin at night, before bed. I also add vitamin E oil, 100% natural from trader joe's.",4
The coconut oil has a pleasant taste and smell.  I use internally as well as a face cream.  I give it to my dog too.,5
I love this coconut oil - it tastes great and works well in smoothies.  The item arrived on time/maybe a little ahead of time which was great!,5
I love this product!!! I use it for my skin which is now glowing. I use it for a hair treatment. Hair has never been softer. I pop popcorn with it. This stuff is good for so many things I can't list them all. Good sized jar for relatively low price.,5
"I use this on my 2 month old's hair and since i began using it his hair has grown significantly and his curls are thick and hydrated. I love the smell once its on his head.pros: big container, low price, natural, great smell, works great, can be used on hair skin or for cooking, not too oilycons: none",5
"I have never been a fan of coconut but when I opened the container, I could not believe the wonderful aroma.  I use this in my coffee and it is delicious.  Highly recommend this product.",5
"I bought it to cook with it, but decided to use it on my skin because of an acne break out I had and it works pretty well. Makes your skin feel nice and smooth, not to mention that I read that it has antimicrobial properties.",5
I bought this product specifically for oil pulling [...]I have been very happy with the product and how quickly it dissolves into liquid form.  I also use for cooking as an alternative to olive oil given the added benefits coconut oil has.  Very happy customer!,5
"It is amazing how versatile coconut oil is and this product works exactly as I hoped.  I've used it in food, on my body and in my hair as a deep conditioning treatment.  I haven't used any other brands but I'm very happy with this one.  I highly suggest!",5
"Great quality, fresh smell. I used this for moisturizing due to my eczema and I would definitely purchase this again.",5
"I use this for my hair after shampooing and before blow drying.  At night, I use the oil on my feet and legs just before going to sleep.  I must use the oil on my body at night so my dogs won't try to lick it all off.  It does smell good.",5
I purchased the organic extra virgin coconut oil to use in homemade body butter and am very happy with the quality of the product.,4
"Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil was my first coconut oil purchase on Amazon.  The reviews really helped answer any questions I had, the description was clear and concise and the price was right.  I received it quickly and in excellent condition.  Whenever I am craving sweets, I grab a spoonful of this yummy product and pop it in my mouth... helps me fill satisfied and eliminates the cravings for sweets.  Good to cook with and has many uses!  I highly recommend this product.",5
Nothing to really say other than its the real deal.  It feels and smells great.  Not the same as refined.,5
My search for an effective face moisturizer is over!  I love coconut oil on my face (AND on my legs and hands).  The oil is readily absorbed and is not heavily scented.  I would and have recommended coconut oil to others.,5
This tends to solidify... Once I rub them into my hand..the heat melts the oil.  Been using it for hair and skin.,5
"It goes without saying the product has health benefits but the non-gmo, organic certs is what I was looking for as ideal. The packaging is sturdy, clean, and shipping was fast. I'm good with my purchase and will certainly order again. It's a little hard for skin application but someone recommended that I just hold it in my hands longer and it made skin application much easier. Sadly I'm just used to slithery, slimy lotions and oils...not realizing that this product is more natural approach. LOVED it on the end of my hair! But primarily...I cook with it or use it for a homemade fudge type treat.",5
"This product is awesome!  I wasn't able to cookwith it, but I use it as a moisturizer on my face.",5
"This stuff is the elixir of life. I live over a mile high - just south of Denver, Colorado and picked up this product due to the damage the climate has been doing to my relatively fair skin. I'm 26, have lived here for 1.5 years ad the combination of the arid climate and (awesome amounts of) sun have already begun to take a toll in the form of slight wrinkles on my face. I was recommended by a friend to try out coconut oil and saw that Viva Labs' product was the most highly rated affordable organic choice available. I gave it a shot and am very glad I did so. This tub will last me literally years and I use it every day on my face, in conditioner, and occasionally for cooking! One thing to note is that although it is technically an oil, it comes in solid form. Perfect for use on your face and can easily be melted for a variety of other purposes. This is my first Amazon review and I'm not some glass half full, happy go lucky, give everything 5 stars kind of guy. This product is the real deal.",5
"More and more I am trying to by organic when I can.  I won't go into much more than that because that is a whole other topic and discussion.I received a sample of this product and really enjoyed it.  I used it for cooking, eating straight up, on my skin and in my hair.This stuff tastes good.  A nice coconut flavor and texture.  It cooks well too.  As with all coconut oils, there is a slight coconut flavor in the cooked product so you'll have to decide what you like with it.  Alternatives are other safe oils, grassfed butter or your saved bacon fat.As a moisturizer it is pretty good, but I prefer a mix with other things like shea butter or cocoa butter etc.  Straight coconut butter is a little greasy.Similar as a moisturizer, it prefers the same as a hair product.  Very good at reducing redness and flacks (which I get in the dry winters in Michigan) but a little greasy.Straight up this is a very good snack. Filling, natural and quality. There are a lot of benefits of coconut oil and if you are following a low carb, keto or other similar diet this really hits the spot and can help with cravings too.",5
"Save the gas and time buy ordering this product online.  Virgin Coconut Oil is good me and I use it to cook with, groom my hair, rub down my skin, not greasy.I use Viva labs all the time and have no complaints.",5
"I have used this product for cooking, as a skin moisturizer, in homemade deodorant and in my daughter's hair. Love the smell too!",5
Came in the mail frozen since it was so cold out but seems to still work fine.  We only use it for our newborn.,4
"My daughter was born with cradle cap, so I purchased this to help moisturize her scalp and face. I love the purity of it, it smells good and was exactly what I expected. If I needed a creamy like texture for her face, I'd use it as it is from the container. It would melt quickly as I placed it on her skin, but not so quick that I couldn't rub it in. For her scalp, I needed it to be liquified, so I'd place a little bit in a bowl, then set the bowl in a bit of warm water until it melted, which depending on how much you use, it takes 3-9 minutes. Once liquified, I poured it on her scalp and rubbed it in.  It definitely helped with the dry skin, but because the cradle cap was so stubborn, I eventually I had to start using olive oil on her scalp. It was a little better than coconut oil, and now her cradle cap is almost gone. I still use the coconut oil on her skin, however, and it works SO much better than lotions and creams.Great product!",5
Price is better than other Coconut oils .  The product has a few less milligrams of the active components in the oil than do competitors (not by much though).,5
"I know it sounds crazy but this is great for a dog's digestion. We put a dollop of this in his food every night. He'd lick it straight off the spoon (and has) every night if we let him.Also good for giving pills.I know the coconut oil has many other uses, but that's ours.",4
This is a fabulous product that I just started using on my skin; I have ditched all of the other body and face lotions to switch to this product.  My skin feels so much better than when I used any of the other lotions that were far more expensive.  Highly recommend!,5
"I use coconut oil daily since there have been reports that it could help stave off Alzheimer's Disease. I am occasionally unable to locate organic oil in my grocery store or health foo store. This shipped more quickly than promised, and I didn't have to interrupt my daily dose of coconut oil. It is also great for skincare!",5
"Very good product and seller,  only thing is that if it was in a glass jar, but besides that it is excellent quality",5
"Due to the cold winter we are having in Michigan, my hands became extremely dry and none of my other hand lotions seemed to help.  So, I tried your Organic Estra Virgin Coconut Oil and saw regular improvements.  Gave some to my co-workers and now we are keeping a jar in our office for everyone to use.  Because some of us have allergies or very sensitive skin we can't use a lot of products, therefore your product has helped tremendously.",5
I use this by itself as a moisturizer and I mix it with other ingredients to make lip balms and skin cream. I mixed it with squalane and it was a perfect lotion for my legs arms and feet. Will purchase again!,5
"I use this product in a variety of ways. As a moisturizer, in smoothies, in my hair, and with cooking. I've noticed a difference in my skin since using it. Highly recommend!",5
I bought this to use for a multitude of things. Mostly right now I am using it as a natural moisturizer. It comes in a hard form so you will have to heat it up to get it soft in order for you to apply it to your skin. Smell is very faint.,4
"this product has all the features i was looking for (USDA seal, extra virgin, organic), the price was right & i could get it quickly...can't ask for more!",5
"We haven't had this product long; however, in about four uses, my daughter's eczema is clearing up well. The smell is faint yet pleasant.I purchased a different brand at our local grocery store for cooking. Once that jar is gone, I plan to purchase this coconut oil for cooking as well.",4
"Good price, Great product. I have used many brands of coconut oil. Trying to find an organic, extra virgin oil at a reasonable price has been tough. This one fits the bill. I will definitely reorder.",5
"This product was just what I expected and more.  It goes on light, non greasy, smells great..  The jar will last at least 6 months, a little goes a long way, and the smell is delicious!  I use it on my feet after bathing, elbows, and my hands!!",3
"This is a quality Item, softens immediately on touch and smells delightful.You wont be disappointed. I will buy this again",5
"This is my first experience with coconut oil, and I love it! It smells so creamy, light, & tropical. I love the way it feels. It makes my skin look so healthy and moisturized. It also tastes great! I keep it on the top shelf in my bathroom so it will be slightly melted when I get out of the shower. (Otherwise, it is solid at room temperature.)I will be trying Trader Joe's unrefined organic coconut oil after this just because it is cheaper ($5.99 for 16oz. at Trader Joe's). But if TJ's brand is not as good, I will definitely stick with this brand.",5
"Viva Labs was my first venture into the much sought after land of coconut oil that we've all read about before. I had little reason to be skeptical, just due to the sheer amount of positive reviews I've heard on its many uses. Immediately I used it as a moisturizer, for my arms and legs and more hesitantly, my face (I have somewhat sensitive skin), as a hair treatment, and slowly, in baking and cooking projects as well. I've had nothing but success in each of my ventures using this, and it's easy to find even more ideas (for cleaning, for energy, etc.) on Pinterest. I now can't imagine not having this coconut oil for its many uses, and plan on stocking up with more as soon as this one runs out.",5
I'm pleased with the product because it is: Organic & Extra Virgin. My dog has cancer (in remission) and the Coconut Oil is a very beneficial addition to his diet.,5
"I'm already recommending it to my family, and will possibly a few more to give out as gifts.  I haven't used it for much, but I suffer from extreme dried skin and I frankly used this on my face and felt so good.  Will post more comments as I use on my hair and potentially cook with it too.",5
I got a 15 oz jar for free by agreeing to write a review. It was as good as any I've ever tried so i happily rate it five stars. And it was good to the last drop. Works fine for frying eggs and everything else I tried it for. It tastes fine even cold and solid.,5
"I have used the other two 'main' brands of coconut oil offered on this site, and Viva Lab's product is the best. It's not grainy or granular, very smooth and creamy...Lovely fresh smell and flavor.I use coconut oil in my cooking, and also use it quite extensively as a skin and hair moisturizer. This product is very well priced and excellent quality.",5
this is exactly what you need. you have to use it on your hair a few times for it to start working (leave it in over night each time) and then it makes your hair so much healthier and smells amazing.,5
"I'm using our second container of Viva Labs CO now and we just love it. It is creamy, delicious, and very pure. We will continue to purchase this product. I have bought several different brands of CO over the years, but I think this is my favorite I just wish it came in a bigger container because we use a lot of CO around our home.",5
This coconut butter is wonderful.  I use it to make my own body butters and it is the best I have used so far.  I will definitely buy it again.,5
"I love this Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. Taste good, and make my skins looks good through the day. I will buy again from Viva. Great product.",5
"....to my entire beauty and health regiment.This product is truly wonderful.  I use it for multiple reasons including health and vanity(no shame).In the morning I use it to swish around my mouth for 20 minutes.  This practice is called oil pulling and this jar happens to be the perfect size to travel with.  Sometimes, I do my swishing routine while on my 2 hour commute through LA traffic.  It's great for preventing plaque and removing toxins.  Healthy gums are everything!First thing once out of the shower as well as the last thing before I sleep, I basically coat my entire body and face in it.  It's truly magical for preventing wrinkles, and moisturizing without toxic chemicals.  It smells nice and is not at all overpowering.  I no longer need purchase lotions or expensive moisturizers.  This stuff is natures greatest gift.Prior to eating, I take 2 to 3 tablespoons of it orally.  Coconut oil has strong antiviral powers as well as proving through personal experience that it aids in food digestion and removal of waste.  Viva Labls Organic, in particular, is just my favorite, as far as mild taste, and brilliant packaging.  Not sure why other Coconut oils seems to come in these ridiculous oversized vitamin bottles, however their packaging just happens to make my constant need and dependency on this stuff very easy to access without mess throughout the day.I credit the ingestion of this coconut oil with curing my chronic sinus infection.  If you commit to daily use, the benefits will pleasantly surprise you.  Your skin will glow. You will feel better.  Seriously.Oh yes, I nearly forgot the greatest benefit!  I work as a hairstylist and instead of pushing products, I just suggest my client buy this stuff and use it to condition their hair once a week.  Personally, I've seen a major difference in the softness and movement in my hair since beginning to use it.  Honestly, I can say, it's so much nicer to cut and style my clients that commit to this once a week.  Their hair feels baby soft and healthy.Highly Recommend.",5
"I have combination skin and everything breaks me out. This sinks into the skin. Has a nice ""beachy"" fragrance that fades. All around lovely product. I'll be ordering more.",5
This oil has a great nutty taste and is very pure. Great for cooking or for body and hair moisturizing.,5
"I started using coconut oil about 6 months ago for dry skin. This product is by far more superior than any of the other brands Ive tried. I would definitely recommend this coconut oil and will purchase again when needed. Also, the shipping was super fast.",5
this is one of the products I will use when I make homemade handcream. I really like this product.. Price is reasonable too.,4
"This jar lives in my shower.  Its certainly helped me with the areas of dry skin I had, and it has even cleared up my acne (research lauric acid in coconut oil if you wonder about how this works). My friend used it on her hair and was amazed at how soft her hair was afterwards. I know its anecdotal, but hey that's what reviews are right?",5
I like the oil and it is very good for the price. If you want a good coconut oil you can choose this one.,5
Great stuff. Can tell it's high quality oil and it smells amazing. Would and will buy again.  Much better than the Walmart stuff.,5
"I ordered Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil because I have begun to experiment with essential oils and coconut oil was a part of a recipe for an all natural absorbent antiperspirant and deodorant. Not only does it work in that concoction mixed with baking soda, cornstarch and essential oils, it has a hundred other uses!  My husband doesn't care for the fragrance of some of the medicinal essential oils so adding the coconut oil changes it a bit. We use it as lip balm, for dry skin relief, as part of an essential oil recipe for restless leg relief, etc (Just don't walk on a ceramic floor after rubbing it on the bottoms of your feet!). We've used half a 16 ounce container and have had it for less than two weeks. I will definitely buy more.",5
"I've only tried one other coconut oil before, so I don't have much to compare this brand to, but I like it overall.I use this as a daily moisturizer after showering in the morning. I apply it to my face (a little will do, as it is oily), shoulders, arms, and anywhere else I feel I need it. I have Keratosis Pilaris on my shoulder/back/arm area, and I've found that using this, instead of my Amlactin lotion (Amlactin Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Moisturizing Body Lotion) I have specifically for that purpose, does a fairly good job of moisturizing so I don't have too many red bumps. I've also recently started using Dove Nourishing Body Wash (Winter Care), so that may factor into it.I've also tried it in my hair, but it made my hair kind of oily. Perhaps it's better to apply just on the ends.Pros:-Smells nice - I love coconut scent!-Moisturizes well.-A little goes a long way (will last a while).-Price (I paid $9.45 for 16 oz.).Cons:-Can cause oiliness if you use too much.I'd probably repurchase.",4
This is awesome! Works wonders as a moisturizer for the body and a great product for the hair! My hubby commented on some face wrinkles going away and didn't even know I was using this also on my face. Needless to say he has started to also use it! I originally got this as a lip moisturizer which it has helped with I use blistex like crazy and was trying to find something natural. I will definitely buy again!!,5
"I purchased Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil as an experiment. I wanted to try cooking with it as well as using it as a moisturizing cream.I love this product!It cooks great at low temps, smells wonderful, feels great on my skin and is over-all a fantastic purchase!Thank you!",5
It was our first time to buy such product and it didn't disappoint us.  We bought it for cooking. It can make the food smelling good and we like the smell of coconut .,5
Our family all has very dry and patchy skin. My kids hate the feel of lotion and I often skipped using lotion. I bought Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil to try and the whole family already loves it. We keep it on the bathroom counter. The kids think it's fun to scoop the oil and watch it melt onto their arms and legs. It absorbs quickly and rough elbows and knees are already smoother. It is easy to use and a little goes a long way! They also like the coconut scent. It reminds us of summer. I am also going to try in the kitchen and in my coffee or tea. There are so  many uses of coconut oil!,5
"I love this stuff!!It is great i use it for frying and cooking pretty much everything, it is the best",5
I've bought other brands that were no comparison for this one.  I'll never buy anything else! Great product for the money.,5
"I love this product, its a large container and is a great price for the size!! I recently purchased a different brand in the store because I happened to walk past it, and I HATED it.  I use this for everything, and I was not able to wiht the other brand I bought. :)",5
"Great product I Love it!  I use it on my face, hands and feet.  I also use it on my children.  Great to cook with as well.  I also give to my dogs as a good fat with their food.  I bought it to use with oil of oregano for my daughter's plantar wart and in less than 1 month, it is completely healed.  The wart had been frozen 5 times by the dermatologist without too much success.  This along with the oil of oregano has gotten rid of it.",5
"I enjoy the coconut oil, it feels and smells wonderful. Seems to help my lips and feet that are dry and cracked.",4
"I rated this a 5 star because the packaging was nice, it smells very good, I love the fact that it makes my hair & skin extra soft. Oh and not to mention, I gave mom & my sister some and they love it.",5
"I received a sample of this in the mail and I couldn't be happier with it. It is great for both skincare and cooking. On your skin, it sinks in quickly, moisturizes wonderfully and smells fantastic. The only downside to using it on your skin is that it can be a little shiny, which isn't surprising for an oil, but if you don't like being shiny, put it on at night instead and wake up to soft, silky skin instead.As for cooking, that's where this stuff really shines. You don't want to use it in everything as it has a bit of a sweet flavor (pesto sauce with this in place of olive oil might be a little odd), but anything that can benefit with a little sweetness is great with this. Try it in baking, or cook your pork chops in it. My favorite was cooking coconut shrimp in coconut oil with a few drops of sesame oil. Best of all, it adds all this great flavor while actually providing health benefits. What more could you ask for?",5
This product is by far the smoothest and most fragrant of the coconut oils I have tried.  I will use again.,5
I use it for everything. A great coconut oil. Only contains cold-pressed coconut and has a nice light scent to it.,5
I love this stuff! I use it daily to remove my face and eye makeup. It leaves my skin clean and soft. I'm excited to experiment with it as it is known to have many other uses and benefits!,5
"Had to buy 2, one for the kitchen and one for the bathroom to use on skin after shower.  Its amazing melted and added to pancake and waffle mixes, actually wish the coconut flavor was stronger, but its more versatile since its not.",5
"I use this primarily for oil pulling--[...]and I've noticed that my teeth have whitened considerably. They also now have a very smooth feel in my mouth. I look forward to the dentist visit to see whether the change is more than cosmetic. Typically I have pretty major tartar buildup on my teeth, so I'm hoping that oil pulling will make a difference. So far, so good!",5
"I use this on my face at night... just a little bit goes a long way.  It's very solid, but immediately melts in your hands.  I also use it on my elbows and feet.  My skin absorbs it right away and leaves it feeling super soft.  Don't use too much if you're using it on your face.  It smells delicious.  I have also used it for cooking, mainly stir-frys.  It gives the food a light coconut flavor, and tastes similar to cooking with coconut milk.  Yum!!",5
"MY HAIRDRESSER RECOMMENDED COCONUT OIL FOR MY HAIR, WHICH IS PROCESSED AND DRY.  THIS PRODUCT DOES A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING MOISTURE TO NOT ONLY MY HAIR BUT MY DRY SKIN AS WELL! I HAVE NOT COOKED WITH IT YET, BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY ADD A NICE FLAVOR AND IS NOW ON THE LIST OF HEALTHY CHOICES. SO YOU HAVE A GREAT HAIR CONDITIONER, SKIN MOISTURIZER AND A HEALTHY COOKING CHOICE!!",5
My husband and I use this to cleanse our mouths.  I used this weeks prior to a dental visit and had excellent results from my hygienist and dentist.  Good taste!,5
"I love this coconut oil. It's rich and creamy and extremely versatile. I use it on my skin, in my hair as a deep conditioner, and even in my smoothies. This sized jar lasts me a good while as a little goes a long way. Try it out!",5
"Top quality product! Have used plenty of brands before this one however, viva labs has great texture, purity and  aroma, highly recommended.",5
Am using this product to heal some ugly red marks on my cheeks of my face.  Seems to be working well but it is a slow process.  I can notice a difference.  Thanks,5
I use coconut oil for EVERYTHING! I love this particular brand. It seems softer and smoother. The only thing is that is does have a smell. My kids say it smells like pop corn. But it goes completely away after 30 min or so.,4
My daughter's hair was a bit fried after dying for the ombre effect.  She read on pintrest that applying coconut oil 3-4 times a week really helps with damage.  We tried the first treatment last night. The smell is wonderful!  Her hair is definitely softer as a result of one treatment.  Great value and the jar should last a long time.,4
This was such a great purchase.  I had never used coconut oil before and wanted something that was just plain natural.  It works beautifully.  It is not greasy and is absorbed fast.  I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of putting stuff on their face with ingredients you cannot even pronounce.,5
"This is it! I love using this coconut oil. Organic no GMO's. Cooks very well, a very nice taste. YUM!",5
"I started using this product as soon as I got it. I'm oil pulling with it--a process in which you let coconut oil sit and swish in your mouth for 15-20mins to remove toxins and bacteria. I've seen a noticeable difference in the health of my mouth and sinuses. I also use the product to moisturize my hair and remove makeup. I highly recommend this coconut oil, it's awesome! So many uses!",5
"Great natural oil - cold pressed. A+. Great taste! (Not very ""coconutty"" - just pure and clean.) Thank you very much!",5
"Coconut oil is good for a lot of purposes, but I use it first in the mornings and as a pre-workout fuel together with whey protein (45 minutes before)... It makes your whey and your energy last longer and makes your body gets in to a state where it choose to burn fat for energy instead of carbs (this only works for anaerobic exercises).",5
I put about a tablespoon of this coconut oil in my hair the night before I take a shower and then wash it out the next morning. I cannot tell you how much my hair has improved since doing this. Breakage has almost stopped and the overall health of my hair has greatly improved. I am very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing some more when I run out!,5
"This product works grate and I love using this butter on a gluten free bread Loaf, it test amazing and helps clearing my system.",5
I just began using this product and find it has great quality. Arrived in perfect condition. I would purchase this again.,4
"I put this on my face and not knowing anything about it I felt extremely nervous that I would wake up with more pimples then I started. I looked in the mirror the next morning and it COMPLETELY cleared my skin. I've used it in my hair as well, it does make it pretty greasy if you don't wash it out eventually but it will definitely make your hair feel so soft. I also use it for shaving cream (careful it makes the shower very slippery) but makes me so smooth!!!!",5
"I just ordered it on a random thought without spending much time...But amazingly, this product turned out really good for me. I am not using it for cooking so cant comment on that. But i am using it for some personal body care and just using it twice has improved my hair texture a little...I am sure it is going to help me more :-)",4
"I purchased this mainly for applying to my dry skin. I have been very happy with it. The best part, no chemicals, or artificial crap!!",5
I was very satisfied with this product.  I love the rich smell of coconut as soon as you open the lid.  I have used it for my skin and also for cooking.  Also my order came very quickly.,5
"I ordered this after reading all the reviews, and am so pleased with my purchase.  This has a nice, delicate coconut flavor and I will be buying more.  We use this in our morning coffee and love it.  I have used it to saut vegetables and in eggs, it only slightly sweetened them.  Good product.",5
"I was looking for a nice, food grade coconut oil, and I found it.  Light, pleasant aroma, and it's very versatile.",5
love this coconut oil.  It has a slight coconut smell but not over bearing.  Notice a difference in a few days,5
great for going back natural and for natural also!. i advise this product to everyone and anyone who is trying to transition,5
"I ordered coconut oil. This is coconut oil. It's good, a lot like other coconut oils. I would recommend this product.",5
I purchased this coconut oil because it received good reviews.  I tried a different brand and this is definitely tastes much more smooth and just tastes very pure.,5
This product is wonderful!! You can use it for most anything and it smells great! I truely do love it!!,5
Very pleasant coconut aroma. Delicious to bake and cook with. Good price for quality of product delivered. Will buy again.,5
"We use a lot of coconut oil at our house. We make our own cosmetics, lotions, etc. I cook with it. I bake with it. This brand does not have an overpowering coconut taste and is a very pleasant addition to anything I have added it to. I would definitely recommend it and I will reorder.",5
Works well.  Ive never used coconut oil before but I used it as a lotion very moisturizing and smells good.,4
"Very fast delivery and excellent product.  Great for hair, nails and especially winter dry skin.  All natural and good for even my sensitive skin.",5
This has got to be the BEST coconut oil I've ever purchased!  DELICIOUS!  Price was amazing compared to other products.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that wants to improve their health or maybe just enjoys the fresh taste of coconut oil. Never disappointed shopping with Amazon!  Kudo's!!,5
"Fast shipping from supplier, great product.  I have been gradually switching to non-GMO products over the last six months.  This product is replacing many of my health & beauty products.",5
"Fast shipping, excellent quality, guarantee...what's not to like? I'm learning more and more about the benefits of coconut oil - I'm going to need to order more soon! 1 for the kitchen, 1 for the bath!",5
Good price for the product. We're finding more and more uses for this; almost time to reorder another jar. This is a very high quality product.,5
"First, I hate coconut. I don't like the taste and am not particularly fond of the smell. However, I LOVE the smell of this product! I bought this to use in a recipe for whipped body butter. I love it and cannot be happier with this product.",5
Be careful not to get it too close to your eyes or you will have blurry vision (like I did) all day long. Could not get it out of my eyes. But it is a good moisturizer for the skins. I know you can also eat this product but I haven't gone there yet and not sure I will.,5
I had been purchasing Jarrows Organic (Expeller Pressed) but its pretty pricey.  I was searching for something similar that was still Organic & Expeller Pressed Or Cold Pressed which means more Capryllic Acid due to the lack of extreme heat in manufacturing.I'm pleased so far & the only thing that raises some questions is why it has more of a smell.  Its a Pleasant Mild Coconut type smell but the Jarrows doesn't have this.  This would Not deter me from future purchases & seems to work just as well for skin/hair.,4
"The cost I paid is about same as the local farmers market, but delivered to my door.I did not taste, it's greasy but smells good. It's very good to my dry skin. I use it to my hands, arms and legs, it greatly moisture and soften the skin.",4
"I purchased this product because I was reading an article about the benefits of giving it to your dog, my dogs on medication that I really don't like giving him but it's necessary for his health, some of the articles I've been reading indicate coconut oil could be a better alternative.I realize it will take a while for any of the benefits to show up, so I'm approaching this with cautious optimism that it will work. The product itself seems to be a good high-quality product, I've tasted it and will use some myself, my dog loves the taste and has no problems with it whatsoever.The coconut oil comes packaged in a glass jar with a very good seal on it, which makes it ideal for storage, I don't think it'll be around that long since my dog really does love the taste and if I keep giving him the recommended dosage, which is 1/4 teaspoons for every 10 pounds body weight twice a day, and my occasional use it should be gone pretty soon.Since coconut oil is so versatile you can use it for a variety of things and I intend to do a little bit of experimenting around the kitchen with it. So far I am very happy with it and do intend to buy some more.",5
"This coconut oil is high quality.  I have been buying coconut oil for over ten years and have a lot of experience on what is GOOD virgin coconut oil.  This is it.  Good strong coconut aroma, very very white and solid at under 72F, and even certified ORGANIC and GMO-free. I highly recommend it.",5
I have had this only a short while but I find it to have so many uses. I can remove my eye make up wonderfully and it is great and chocolate chip cookies!,5
This is a very effective moisturizer.  It does not have an overwhelming coconut scent.  It worked very well as an intense hair masque.,5
"One of the reasons I chose this brand is that it is organic, that is important to me. I was buying another brand and they no longer offer free shipping, so I switched to this brand. I use it mostly in smoothies and it tastes good, I have not yet tried cooking or baking with it. The label gives clear information for ingredients and uses for the product. I only gave it 4 stars because I have not yet used it for cooking or for skin care. It has a nice fresh coconut smell.",4
This was my first time trying coconut oil.  I wanted an alternative to the stick of butter that was always sitting next to the stove.  This comes in a tub as a soft/solid and melts easily when placed in a hot pain.  It smells like HEAVEN and I actually mixed a little in with my lotion and it gave my skin a super nice sheen.  I will definitely be purchasing more when I run out.  I didn't notice any coconut flavor to my meals nor did my boyfriend.,5
"Coconut Oil is a wonderful, natural moisturizer that is often overlooked. My experience with coconut oil reaffirms my long standing belief that it outperforms, by far,  the claims of so many ""newly discovered substances"" such as argan oil,etc, that  are now being sold at astronomical prices.  I use it on my face, apply it to my hair after shampooing, but, especially on my elbows and heels.  It is soothing and healing  on my very dry hands that crack easily.At the same time, I often use it to replace cooking oil in some of my recipes.I think it is one of Mother Nature's most perfect creation.",5
It smells and tastes really good.  It gives you a burst of energy and helped with my low carb weight loss.  I have since ordered another brand from here and it's actually better tasting and better energizing.  N.W.,4
"I used the coconut oil on my very dry hair and it works very well. It is not as heavy as the Shea butter, and it has nice coconut fragrance.",5
"Very creamy texture since I bought it. Its the first coconut oil I've had that has given me almost immediate results for skin care. My legs were super soft after just one use!I also put this kind of coconut oil in my coffee every morning and it is delicious, which is surprising because I don't usually like the taste of coconut! :) Thinking about buying several more jars, just to have on hand!Very good product and I HIGHLY recommend for anyone looking to buy organic, extra virgin coconut oil.",5
This is the first time I've bought coconut oil and I'm officially in love! I love that it's organic! The uses for coconut oil are really just endless and I love that I can trust an organic and wholesome company!,5
I never really write reviews... but this is a very good product.  I highly recommend this purchase for anyone looking for a high quality coconut oil.,5
"Great product, quick shipping. I use both in the kitchen and as a skin care product. Difficult to find organic product of this size and quality for a better price. I love that it comes as a solid.",5
"I started using this coconut oil late 2013.  Since then, I have become so addicted that I stock it up anytime I have the money.  It is so great for my hair and skin!!!  The texture and smoothness are unbeatable.  It has no strong smell, so pleasant to use. Great for eliminating dandruff and smoothening rough skin",5
My Chiropractor recommended coconut oil for me to try.  I love it & use it daily in my cooking & in place of butter & margarine.  It's wonderful.,5
"Unrefined and Organic!  Always buy Unrefined coconut oil, which costs a little more because the process is more time consuming.",5
I use this coconut oil with my shampoo to wash my hair.  Have only used it a few times but so far I like it a lot.,4
"Coconut oil is great for all uses, I recommend. But, it is hard especially in the winter months. You will need to warm it.",4
I  have a 8 months old son and his hair is so thick and plentiful that every time I comb it he would cry. Since I bought this product his hair is so much more softer and manageable. I also use it in my hair and I love it!!!  CWL,5
Love this product.  Bought it to make some body butter and for oil pulling.  I will only purchase organic products.,5
"I've only used it for the past week, primarily in my food and so far it's been great. I've put it in oatmeal, some pastry dishes and even added some to protein shakes. It has a fantastic taste and is a really quality product.",5
"I love this,it has straightened my toddler's once really nappy and curly hair. I don't shampoo it out ,I leave it in and comb out the hair,just wonderful. I love it on my skin,its too rich for me to take as a supplement,my toddler does though.",5
Am 77 year old female living in NJ. This product as described.  Working very well for this winter's dry skin.  Recently recommended by my Doctor to apply to my scalp in order to encourage hair growth.,5
"The price was great. It came quickly as promised. Seems equal to other coconut oils I've used. We put in on our skin, in our hair, on our baby, in our food! Good Stuff!",5
so many different ways to use this product.  my dog is a finicky eater but loves this stuff.  mixed this in with her food and she licked her bowl clean.  i will be purchasing again!!,5
I used this coconut oil to make chapstick and it turned out great!  Next I'll be using it for homemade lotion.  Seems like a great quality product!,5
"(THE BEST!) First of all when you use this product it has a light scent of coconut when heated.I used it two days in a row, it stayed fresh! thank you.",5
We recently moved from using vegetable and canola oil to red palm and coconut oil for cooking.Coconut oil is imparts a wonderful flavor into everything it touches. It is really neat too to watch it melt when you put it in the pan.We also have put a bowl next to the sink to use as a moisturizer after washing our hands.  Amazing again how much better this works than petroleum or water based lotions.This particular coconut oil is simply amazing.  The manufacturer sent me a free trial and I can honestly say that I prefer it to the the coconut oil we had been buying from our big box store.,5
"This is a great oil and I am really glad I purchsed with them.  I will definitely re-order with this company.  I use it in the shower and it is heavenly for so many things....skin, hair...and smoothies",5
"This product feels a little smoother than the other coconut oil I've tried. I love the stuff. I can't put it on my face (a breakout was a huge indicator), but I put it on my hands at night and it keeps them silky smooth through the sub zero winter.",5
"This coconut oil is a brilliant all-purpose product. I use it as an overnight hair mask, a body oil- even for the face, makeup removal, and as a cooking ingredient. It smells nice and keeps you healthy.",5
"Such a great product, and a fantastic company as well, they have the best intentions of making customers happy, and making the world a better place, this product is exactly what I wanted, It came in the mail fast, and is just by far great. bravo.will be buying from via labs again.",5
I have just started using coconut oil and am trying out different brands.  I was very impressed with the smoothness and also how it dissolved and stayed dissolved in my cup of blenderized hot coffee/coconut oil concoction.  Will definitely buy again.  Does it come in a larger jar?,5
this coconut oil has all of the necessary things to make it the highest quality coconut oil available!!Try it you wont be disappointed!,5
"Viva Labs is an excellent organic pure coconut oil  ,you can cooking with it or just use it on your skin , I love to use it on my face ,hands or all over my body 5",5
"I like the oil, feels like cream, but when you touch it melts. Smells like a real coconut, but doesen't have taste.",5
I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this product.  I have scooped out some and keep it in a small container in the bathroom and keep the rest in the kitchen.  I haven't used it for cooking yet but I have used it on my son and I.  He has very sensitive skin and eczema on his feet and this helped a lot.  I have also used it as lip balm for both of us and moisturizer on his face.  It melts quickly in your hand and smells wonderful (if you like coconut).  My son even tried to lick it!,5
"We have been using this coconut oil for our young sons' skin, and it keeps them moisturized without feeling greasy. The scent is pleasant but not overpowering.",5
"If I could give this product and Viva Labs a higher rating than five stars I certainly would. I mainly purchased the coconut oil to make beauty products, but upon receiving this I learned that there was so much more I could do with it. Last night, I used it as a hair mask and my hair has never been as soft and shiny as it is today! It's also a great skin moisturizer and smells good too, but not overpowering. I love, love, love this product and will be purchasing more as soon as I get low. Give it a try - you won't be disappointed.",5
Good coconut oil at a good price. The jar was sealed very well. Actually difficult to remove the seal. Preferable to the 2 jars of red palm oil I received last year where both leaking when I got them. I have read that coconut oil is the most stable oil when cooking with it. It has a mild taste and actually adds a nice taste in some dishes. I switch between this and ghee which is also pretty stable when cooking with it.,5
"It smells so good and mixes smoothly with my shea mixture, so of course I love it. Will definitely buy from them again in the future.",5
"This is very premium quality at a great price!  This coconut oil has so many uses, there isn't enough room for me to list them.  It is a must buy!!!!",5
"I recently switched my eating to a more plant based diet and have become more conscious of my oil cumsumption. Coconut oil is healthier and tasty. If you're on the fence, just buy it. There are many recipes out there to try and I am enjoying them.",5
I have tried a few coconut oils and this one is by far my favorite for it's delicate flavor and smooth texture. I use it for high heat cooking and sometimes I eat a spoonful for an energy boost.,5
I am beginning to use this for everything! Feels good on the skin and it taste great with the food I cook it with. :),5
I have used few brands of coconut oil from whole foods/Traders Joe's and some from Amazon but I have to say Viva brand tastes much better.  My friend who denied eating coconut oil because of the nauseating feeling ate it and said 'this tastes better'.,5
Love it I had been using coconut oil with sugar as a body and face scrub n on my hair and it's amazing. I now started to use it on my face and leave it overnight my skin is glowing and healthier than ever.,5
Delicious especially in my Asian stir fry. Also great in smoothies. Luxurious on the skin too! Fragrance is sublime. I'd recommend.,5
"I am very satisfied all around with this coconut oil that I order, it arrived promptly, well packaged and the quality of the oil is excellent.  I used a different brand previously and I like this one better as it absorbs very easily into the skin, it has a slight fragrance of coconut that goes away soon after you apply it.I highly recommend this product.",5
"Tastes and smells absolutely DELICIOUS, I've been doing nearly all my frying with this and my food has never been better. I weightlift for a couple hours every day and the coconut oil is so good I've been just eating a spoonful before my workouts for added energy. I love the flavor and have been putting it on toast instead of butter.Overall fantastic product and the best coconut oil I've ever used.",5
"This is a great oil for cooking, and doesn't leave any sort of taste with the food cooked in it.  And it doesn't taste half bad just on its own.  Give it a try, always a good thing to find a great oil that is a bit healthier for you",5
The oil is fine but two days after I got it in the mail I found a 54oz (the one I bought was 16oz for $11.49) jar at Sam's club for 15.00. I wish I hadn't opened it right away so I could return it.,3
"I originally bought coconut oil because a lot of people told me that it would help with my 7 month-old's eczema. It did, in fact, help her a lot. Her skin has never been so smooth, and it only takes about a teaspoon to cover her whole body. A little goes a long way! Full disclosure, I've never used any other brand of organic coconut oil, and the reason I bought this particular brand was because of the price. I am very happy with this product, and I have used it for tons of different things. I've used it on my baby's skin, on my skin, on my husband's skin (TMI?), as well as in my smoothies and in all my baking. Today I made a banana bread that called for a whole stick of butter ---- instead, I measured out half a cup of coconut oil, and the finished product tasted amazing. I'm a coconut oil fan now, for sure.",5
"I have been using the product for several weeks now.  I use it on my hair, which is curly, and I love how it gives it a natural shine without getting it stiff or dry.  The ladies love it on me.",5
"I can't praise this coconut oil enough! I use it for VARIETY of things- cooking, hair mask, night time face moisturizer, after shower body moisturizer, I use it instead of neosporin on burns, cuts and marks. I LOVE it! First of all - it's natural! Second of all - no chemicals or harshness. I blend it with avocado oil, honey and lemon and use it as hair mask which leaves my coarse and damaged dry hair soft like satin. I use it at night on my face before going to bed - just applying it all over my face and neck and even whole body and I wake up in the morning with baby's skin. Keep in mind you have to give it some time to absorb otherwise your PJ's, sheets and pillowcase will get oil stains. I also use this oil on burns from curling iron, oven and cooking - works wonders and NO SCARING either! So yes, this is a multiuse item with variety of benefits!",5
"I love the Coconut Oil. Once I used it, I could tell from the smell that it's 100% pure coconut oil. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star is that it comes in a plastic container, which made warming it/scooping out some the first time a bit of a challenge. For this reason and because of finding another brand at cheaper cost somewhere else, I probably wouldn't buy it again, not because of flavor though.",4
"The package arrived earlier than expected, which was great. The coconut oil smells wonderful, just like fresh coconut. I initially purchased this product to use on my skin or mix with some Shea butter to make my own skin cream.  So far, I've only used it straight on my skin and it works quite well and absorbs quickly. The oil is solid, so I scoop out a small bit with a spoon and drop it on my hand and it melts almost instantly into oil. Still in search of a good unrefined Shea butter to create my on skin cream to help moisturize my arms, legs and arms during the extremely harsh winter here in the northeast. I also used it on my dry scalp, left it on for a few minutes before shampooing it off and it worked wonders. It left my scalp less itchy and not greasy.I still haven't used it for cooking as shown in the many reviews. I can only say it's a wonderful product at a great price. I purchased a 16 oz. jar and that should last me a while.",5
"Pure coconut oil makes a great addition to your personal health supply. It can be used for cooking, massage, or as a personal lubricant. Solid at room temperature, it melts into a buttery smooth oil within moments of skin contact. After being worked into the skin, it leaves a velvety-soft texture that is neither greasy nor sticky. Do not confuse this product with coconut butter, which is grainy, dry, and difficult to remove by hand.My girlfriend purchased this Viva oil for my birthday, and I love it. It's organic, so I feel comfortable using it as a food supplement. The wide-mouth jar is squat, making it easy to avoid messes. The Viva Labs brand is comparable to other extra virgin coconut oils I've tried, so by all means shop around. But if what you're interested in is a reliably pure coconut oil, you won't be disappointed by this product.",5
Anyone looking for a great tasting and therapeutic alternative should try this.  I like its taste and its moisturizing capabilities very much.,4
"After looking for quite some time at organic extra virgin coconut oil, I found the Viva Labs brand for much less than the others.  I was a little skeptical about the quality of the product, but quickly discovered that this is a very high quality product.  This is the coconut oil I will be using from this point forward.  I highly recommend Viva Labs for your coconut oil or any product they produce!",5
This product has the great coconut smell I've been looking for and makes my skin and hair feel soft and healthy.,5
I love this product! My skin feels amazing after just 4 days of use! I would recomend this product to anyone who has any sort of dry skin.,5
The cocount oil feels so good on my skin and absorbs quickly. I also used the coconut oil on my hair and my hair after one treatment looks so healthy. Great buy.,5
"I've already used it as a body cream, face cream, for cooking and to just eat raw. I love it!",5
"I've just started using the coconut oil as a replacement for a lot of more expensive products on my skin - I have very sensitive skin and I'm very acne prone! So far, my skin has been very smooth and felt much less irritated after using it for just a few days. I'm hopeful that it'll work well on eventually clearing up my acne as well (combined with a healthy skin diet of course! :) )",5
"Great product! Arrived quickly. Worked immediately on dry skin due to harsh winter and hard water + detergents!  Strongly recommend for the price, quality, and positive results!",5
Just started using this for the health benefits.  Better than others I have tried.Product was packaged and shipped propmly.  Would buy it again,5
This is really new to me.  I am still reviewing this product for now.Maybe after a few weeks I give some kind of an approval rating.,4
"I just recently found out about the benefits of coconut oil, and I will highly recommend this to anyone who considering using natural products. I've swapped this for my shaving lotion, face lotion, and body lotion. It's a bit oily on your face, but all you need to do is towel off the excess, and it's perfect. I've been using it for 2 weeks now, and I've gotten no pimples on my face...and the best part is that I'm saving A LOT of money.",5
Great product.  I use it on my hair and my skin.  Has a light sweet coconut scent and feels wonderful.,5
"I have been taking flax oil, but lately when the Taste of the Flax oil changed to Bitter  it occurred to me the Obama administration was trying to poison me with a cheap substitute.  Part of there Government intervention plan for the good of the people.  All Joking aside my Sister whom is married to an Army Doctor at West Point new york told me i should start taking coconut oil and i have noticed and immediate good result.  My skin is softer and less headaches as the FAT  POISONS  BREAK  DOWN  IN MY BRAIN  VEINS so i dissapoint the Government STROKE  PLANS  FOR  ENEMIES of the State.  Funny Eh.  Murder nice and legal like.Rog",5
"I love the coconut oil!  I'm using it as a moisturizer, and it does such a great job on my face and other places on my body where the skin is very dry.  I highly recommend it to anyone.",5
I ordered this cause someone said it could help me with my dry shin.  I love this product and it has helped a lot with my dry/itchy skin due to the cold weather.  i highy recommend this product.,5
I love this stuff. You can use it for literally anything. Product came quickly and was packaged in a sanitary matter,5
The taste was amazing -- better than other coconut oils that I have purchased in the past.  Will definitely buy again!,5
First time using coconut oil. I've been using it on my skin and used it to make some homemade deodorant. Feels smooth on my skin and it's not too heavy for my generally oily complexion. It has a pleasant odor like coconut that you bake with.,5
"I am so glad to find such a great way to purchase organic, cold pressed coconut oil.  The service was first rate.  Quick delivery, and quality product.  I am so careful about the food I eat, and organic coconut oil is such a beneficial fat.  I try to ingest 3 Tablespoons a day.  I cook with it, fry with it, use it like butter on toast, and even use it as a body, face, and hair moisturizer.  To have it delivered so quickly to my door saves me shopping time.  It couldn't be more convenient.",5
I have very dry skin and this product goes on well.  It makes my skin feel much better.  It also smells wonderful.,5
"I don't dislike this product, but it wasn't what I hoped it would be. I bought this for my daughters dry natural curly hair hoping to add lots of moisture and help keep her hair nice and healthy. But it didn't seem to do much at all for her hair. I do still use it every so often on her hair. I let it sit well she's in the tub then rinse using a leave in conditioner afterwards. I also add a little to her bath water sometimes which seems to help moisturize her skin some as well. Not a complete loss, but I'm not sure I'll order again.",3
This is a very smooth high quality oil. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does not have much coconut flavor but this could be a plus for some people depending on what one wanted to use it for.,4
"I started using Coconut Oil last summer after reading some reviews online.  I have been a die hard fan since then.  I haven't bought a bottle of lotion since.  I have 2 kids with eczema, and since we started using coconut oil, they have not had any breakouts.  The prescription creams we had didn't even work as well.  I only wish I'd known about this stuff years ago.",5
I have tried numerous brands of coconut oil. This is my least favorite. I found this to almost be on the watery side.,2
"I ordered it as a  part of my diet. I love to cook on this oil, smell great and it's very healthy.",5
This has done absolute wonders with my hair! The longer you leave it in the better! I love cooking pancakes with it as well! Leave a little coconut taste! Yum!! I can't wait to check out more products!!,5
Made my skin super soft and made my hair super silky. I can't wait to try it out for cooking too,4
"I wasn't sure what to expect from coconut oil but it had been recommended by a friend an alternative to butter and olive oil.I was extremely excited to find that coconut oil is delicious and even my husband enjoyed this. Great for making popcorn and spreading on toast, too!",5
"I've been using coconut oil not only to cook with but as a diet supplement, and hair and body lotion. Viva smells fainly, as well as tastes like coconut. It is a nice white color and of course melts as the temp rises. Believe me, it is good enough to eat off a spoon, which I do  on a daily basis.  I also use it on my hair to tame the flyaways and to make it sooo shiny. Just use a little because it goes a long ways. It makes my skin so soft, and gives me a slight coconutty fragrance. It's organic, it's extra virgin and those things count in a coconut oil used for health reasons especially. Thanks Viva, for a great product.  Also, this product came sealed and did not leak from the container. It also smells and tastes very fresh.",5
"I almost hate to write a review as it might make the price go up. This is a very good price for Coconut oil. I use it as a moisturizer for my horrible dry skin, and the second jar I bought, I use for cooking.",5
This has been the most effective product i have found to sooth itchy dehydrated skin conditions.I would highly recommend this for anyone who suffers the same.,4
"I bought this to help my dry skin during the winter months, but love the fact that you can use it internally or externally.  The light texture spreads easily, and the fragrance is heavenly.",5
"Its an awesome product. Bought it mainly for hair care, its not sticky and at the same time serves the purpose of a great hair oil. Coming from Southern part of India, the secret behind long strong hair for women in those places in the daily use of coconut oil",5
I was diagnosed with ALS a year ago and need Coconut oil as a nutrient and this organic virgin oil is perfect.,5
"If you are trying to stay on a ketogenic diet, coconut oil is superior to heavy cream in terms of carbs. I had a reoccuring UTI and after much research I discovered a 1902s Harvard educated doctor who had treated patients by putting them on a VERY low keto diet for 21 days. Maintaining ketosis  under 30 carbs a day is tough and this coconut oil is great for that. Start out low at first, it has a laxative effect if over done.For breakfast I make a ""Magic Bullet"" coffee which is freshly brewed coffee  mixed with 1-2 Tablespoons coconut oil and 1-2 Tablespoons butter. I just use my blender for 15 seconds on highest speed and have a yummy frothy high fat zero carb breakfast.  Love the faint coconut taste of Viva Labs product and it is easier to scoop out of the small container in the colder months.Medium chain triglycerides in coconut oil are superior fat to any vegetable oil (PUFAs) out there and since PUFAs have a direct link to cancer, I either use coconut oil or lovely saturated fats such as lard from grass grazed animals, bacon fat or my beloved duck fat when I can find it. Try it, you'll be happy you did.",5
"Viva Labs Coconut Oil arrived very quickly and was everything I expected.  There are so many ways to use coconut oil - it's health benefits are known far and wide.  As it is organic, it was the coconut oil of choice for me!",5
"Yep, it's great.  Totally soothes my skin.  Smells delicious but smell fades in less than hour.  Great stuff.  I love it",5
"This is my first time to make body butter, and this coconut oil was very easy to use.  It is not too thick and even though there is a scent  of coconut it is not overwhelming.  I'm not sure what other reason there is to use coconut oil, but for making body butter this was a good choice.  We have had bad weather which delayed delivery, but the company cannot be faulted for that.  I did receive an e-mail stating that UPS would not be able to deliver products on time, but no one here could have expected on time deliveries due to a huge snowfall.  The e-mail was a nice PR touch!",5
"This is great stuff, I have no complaints. There are so many uses for coconut oil I wish I had learned about it sooner. Get yourself some and you won't be disappointed.",5
"The written description and pictures are accurate. My order was received on time. It tastes great, and I recommend this brand of coconut oil!",5
"I use coconut oil head to ""tail"" - literally. Just look up all of its uses. There are over 100. It has replaced my hair masks, moisturizer and eye makeup remover. Give it a try!",5
"My first purchase of coconut oil was a refined bottle. I didn't look closely enough to see that it was refined, and at the time, I wasn't aware that there were different types of coconut oil, processed-wise. After doing more research, I've learned how much better organic coconut oil is for you. Let me say, organic extra virgin coconut oil is worth the price! The taste is really different too!",5
"We have tried several brands from various manufacturer/ distributors. We use coconut oil to brush our teeth, for our scalp, to cook with, and we ingest it by the heaping teaspoon full.We have found that coconut oil by the teaspoon is great just before bed for people with acid reflux. This is probably why we really love this brand. It is easy to take by the teaspoon full. It has a light coconut flavor which we like. Some other brands are unpleasant to ingest.Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a fantastic overall useful coconut oil.",5
"I'm am so happy with this product... Using it to reduce inflammation , and it's helping. Coconut oil is so helpful with so many things.",4
I prefer to use this for cooking.  I recently started using coconut oil as a sort of mouthwash. This does just fine for that. Although I do wish it has a little more coconut flavor to it. That said though it is wonderful substitute for butter or shortening . I used it in a white cake mix and it was yummy!,4
"I use this for baking, frying, lotion, and in homemade deodorant. We're on our second jar now. I have no complaints!!!",5
I absolutely LOVE this coconut oil. It is pure coconut oil with no preservatives. I use it for my face and hair and it does wonders. A friend of mine put it in her tea and she said it tasted very well. Great buy !,5
"I ordered this to help with stretch marks as I am 37 and pregnant with our first child.  I figured it couldn't hurt, right?First, I will say that it's a bit hard to scoop out of the jar.  I just use a small spoon that I keep in the jar - you don't need very much and the good thing is that once you scoop it out and put it on your skin, it pretty much instantly melts.  It smells WONDERFUL also and as I am pregnant in the wintertime, it's a nice summery natural coconut smell which makes me think of the coming warm months.  A very high quality product!  I also use it on my arms or anywhere else I have dry skin.",5
My purchase came in the mail as scheduled and since i have used the product I've enjoyed it ! I am primarily using it as a beauty supply and am satisfied thus far with the overall product,4
"I use it mostly for skin care and its therapeutic properties, but I'm sure I'll use it for cooking as well once my grocery store brand is depleted.  I love the light coconut scent of this, and I was pleased to find this totally organic and natural product for a decent price.  I will definitely be ordering from Viva Labs again.",5
This is amazing stuff!! This is transformed my super dry skin! I can even use it on my face with no breakouts! Takes a few minutes to absorb but sooooo worth it! I have KP that gives me fits during the winter months. This makes my skin so smooth!,5
I bought this product for a healthy topping for my popcorn.  It tastes wonderful.  I have also put it on Waffels and toast and I have fried with it.  It smells and looks like you would expect it to.  I have another brand that I had purchased a few months ago and this is far superior.,5
"This is creamy white solid coconut extract.  It does not come as an OIL.  It comes as a solid which (with a little heat) will turn into an oil.  Easy to apply and is absorbed after a few minutes.  They clain it is so pure you can use it for cooking, and I will have to see how something tastes after using it.",4
"Received our viva labs Coconut Oil in two days (prime).  I haven't used this brand before, but it smells wonderful, and I've used it to fry eggs this morning and it is wonderful.  Would definately recommend buying from viva labs.",5
"I love the taste and consistency of this product. Combined with the purported health benefits, I give it an A+. I usually add a spoonful to my coffee in the morning. It is good enough to eat plain.",5
So far I've only had the product a few days so it hasn't had time to prove any results for what I intended it BUT I didn't know it had so many uses & I am impressed with the taste.,4
This is my first experience using Coconut Oil. I've been very pleased with using it in cooking and it does give a nice flavor when you want to have a touch of sweetness!,5
Good value for the size you get. Love using this in my shakes and as a substitute for butter or oil in my frying pans!,5
"This particular brand of Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by Viva Labs is excellent for all the multiple uses in my household.  My friends teasingly refer to me as super crunch! :)I have used this coconut oil on my hands (moisturizer overnight), on my feet (same thing!), in my mouth (oil pulling!), and in my hair (THE BEST CONDITIONER!)  I have tried 3 different brands & this one will now be my old faithful. The texture, and the smell are so much nicer than others. It is unrefined, and you can tell the difference!  You can actually tell it is natural, it is not all one color, and just a white substance, in the jug, you can tell that it is pure, cold pressed, I LOVE IT. It absorbs into my hands quickly, my cuticles are really appreciating it. The tiny dry spots that were on the top of my feet are gone. And, this is after just one night time use!  This stuff is pure, and the benefits are apparent!  Thank you Viva Labs for manufacturing this product, please continue!",5
I bought this primarily as a hair conditioner but also as a skin moisturizer.  It is doing a great job at both right now and I'm really pleased with my purchase.  It's also important to me that it is organic.,4
I use it for cooking and in my hair as well and it has helped me lose weight as well as made my hair super shiny and healthy! Definitely going to buy again!!,5
This oil is fabulous! I use it on my skin and my hair while leaving you smelling like coconut. Yum!,4
"I use this for my Greyhounds paws (they are dry and cracked) and for his skin (he has dry flaky skin), he's an old man and has old man problems ;) He loves this stuff, and I also love it (it smells just like fresh coconuts, in other words DELICIOUS. His skin is getting better, and his paws look great (although I am surprised that any of it stays on since he loves to lick it off). I recommend this product.",4
"Product arrived as promised, and it is great on my hands and feet, especially in the winter.  I would recommend this product.",5
my toddlers love this in pancakes and waffles and don't even know they are missing out on butter or margarine.,5
I love that way this makes my skin feel and I love to cook with this too. Doesn't take much either. I would recommend this for the softest skin you will ever have and the good feeling you get with putting into your diet.,5
I use this coconut oil in my green smoothies and it tastes great.  I also use for scalp massage to help with keep my hair healthy and growing long.  I have used it for intensive facial moisture treatment after I have a facial.  It can also be used for cooking.  This is a high quality product.,5
I love the taste of this organic coconut oil . Sometimes i use it for my coffee and sometimes i replace butter with this,5
"FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT IS- EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES. I love this product. Smells great -tastes great -  feels great. This is a product that you can honestly love from the inside out and vice versa.I have used this in my cooking and it melts wonderfully, and light flavoring comes alive. I have added this to my hair conditioners and wow soft hair. I have added it to my moisturizers and yes, the smell is ""ooh, Valerie, what are you wearing"" good!Wonderful all around inside out outside in type of product.Love love love!!did I mention that this item is great from head to toeGet some of this in your life YA""LLBOOYAKA !!!",5
This product is great ! Feels so good on the skin and also it is really great for cooking !,4
"I love this product. I've recently been on an organic, cruelty-free kick; it was completely refreshing to be able to read the ONLY item under 'ingredients'- coconut oil.Very versatile product, I use it on my skin, in my hair, and while cooking.",5
"To be honest, I haven't used this much.  It smells great and feels like it moisturizes.  My sister swears by coconut oil for everything (in her coffee, on her hair, mouth wash, etc!!). The item arrived on time and packaged fine.  No issues.",5
"This absorbs so well on your skin. It looks greasy at first, but after 10 minutes it is absorbed. Feels great on your skin, and excellent for deep conditioning your hair if it is dry. A little goes a long way, so it will last for a long time.",5
Delivered with my other items in perfect condition.  I use this to make body butter and choose to use organic products.,5
"I'm very pleased with the value I received, it is a very generous amount. The smell and feel of this product is really great. We will continue to purchase from Viva Labs in the future.",4
"I use the  coconut oil for cooking, baking, and for my hair and it is perfect. It has natural, irresistible coconut taste and smell that will make you want more of it. I wanted pure coconut oil and Viva Labs gave it to me. I am completely satisfied with the product and highly recommend it to everyone.",5
"I used this as a hair treatment with an egg and honey, and then I covered with the Diane Processing Caps. I left it on for 4 hours and shampooed and conditioned like normal. I LOVE the results. My hair is frizzy, wavy and natural. The problem I had was that it (apart from being frizzy) was not shiny.The results: my hair is manageable, but I find that it actually feels SOFTER when I straighten it (I have no idea why).However, it overall feels so much softer and more manageable.I will continue to purchase this (:",5
"I purchased this product based on reviews from other long-haired dog lovers who said that a daily spoonful of coconut oil really helped keep their dogs' coats shiny and reduced dry, flaky skin.  I like the fact that there are no additives or preservatives in this product.  So far, my dog loves the taste, and although I haven't used it long enough to see a difference in her coat, I plan to continue feeding it to her as a special treat.  With the terribly cold weather we've been having and the fact that she's happiest when she gets to play in the snow, coconut oil should help her coat and skin.",5
This is a wonderful all-natural way to moisturize your skin and condition your hair.  It leaves your skin and hair feeling amazing!,5
I chose this oil because of the price point.  I got it and have been thoroughly impressed with the taste.  I mix it into oatmeal in the mornings and it tastes amazing.,5
"This stuff is like magic!!!! I have some of the dryest, brittle, most unmanageable head of hair I've ever seen....this adds shine, manageability, prevents breakage, and locks in moisture......I want to buy all my friends a jar to spread the love!!!!!",5
I wanted to find coconut oil that didn't have any added fragrance. This turned out to be just the thing. It smells coconutty but not perfumey. I use it as a beauty product but am tempted to cook with it as well. Shipping was fast.,5
"I switched to this product recently, when the one I have ordered in the past was no longer available.  However, this product is organic and works great for my hair.  The price was wonderful.  I will definitely order this again!",5
My 5 year old daughters broke out with a rash around their mouths.  After vising the derm they said it was perioral dermatitis and they aren't sure what causes it and what can make it go away.  In adults they would prescribe long term antibiotics which I did not want to do for my kids.  We tried 12 WEEKS of two different topical treatments that did not work and actually made the rash worse by either burning or drying it out. When at the dentist the hygienist told me that her daughter had a rash that wouldn't go away and they tried coconut oil and it worked.  She thought it would be helpful for us since it smells good and wouldn't be harmful if my little girls accidentally got it in their mouths.  I was skeptical but figured it would give it a try.  Within two weeks the rash is gone.  My poor little girls suffered for MONTHS and this is what finally helped???  I'm sold.  I've used it on my hair for deep conditioning and love the results too.  This is a great all purpose product.,5
I  bought this for just my dogs... to put in their kibble which I might add- they LOVE! Rub a dab on some hot spots on them as well and its done wonders.. I give it a high rating!,5
"Great product! I mix it with apricot kernel oil (so that it is smooth at room temp) and bergamot essential oil to make a soothing, invigorating moisturizer. Coconut oil has many culinary uses too, and this one is food grade. So I'll probably order another jar for the kitchen soon. Mine arrived within two or three days, shrink wrapped. Awesome!",5
"Viva Labs Organic Extra virgin Coconut oil is the way to go! All natural, pure and great for everything from soft skin to baking cookies!",5
"Love coconut oil.  Such a great multi-purpose product.  Great for cooking, skin and hair.  I usually use it to replace oil or butter.",5
"I have tried other brands of coconut oil, and this is my favorite.  In fact, I am ordering more today.I love the flavor it adds to my cooking as well as the health benefits!  Definitely worth it.",5
This was our first time to try coconut oil after learning about its' many benefits.  We're very pleased with this brand.  We've used it on our skin and hair and cooked with it.  My husband even puts it in his coffee!  We'll purchase again.,5
This is my first time using Coconut Oil like this.  I heard that it is really good for our face and skin.  This order arrived quickly and there is a nice coconut scent.,5
"There are apparently a great many ways to use coconut oil and, for us, we've used it for hair treatment, short term remedy for a sore throat and a skin moisturizer.  Given that this brand was a fair price, I'm sure there may be better, more expensive brands but it's our first batch so we have little reference to go off of seeing as we have a limited budget.",4
Very satisfied with quality and flavor. We use it everyday for frying eggs - really adds flavor to food! Highly recommend.,5
"Great for hair, skin, to take as a supplement, and for cooking!  Popcorn tasted great using it!  I Highly recommend!",5
"Works great as a leave in conditioner for hair, moisturizer for skin (especially in the winter when my hands are dry and cracked)... even tastes great as a substitute for butter in the frying pan!  Much healthier option.  Great product.",5
"Coconut oil is a staple in my cupboard, the this Viva Labs product is as good as any high quality option. I cook with it and add it to my coffee for an extra boost in the morning.",5
I don't why companies request reviews from consumers so early.  I just received this yesterday and they're already asking for a review.  I bought this for cosmetic use (skin care).  So far I've just dabbed a little under my eyes overnight.  It feels nice and moisturizing.  I will try it on my hair too.,4
"I've used it several different ways, but my favorite is using it to make popcorn.  My grandparents owned a movie theatre for years, and ALWAYS used coconut oil for the popcorn.  It's so delicious!",5
"Organic is the way to go. This coconut Oil can be used for cooking, baking and skin care. I like the quality and price on the Viva labs product. I have already gave some to a co worker and mother to try and they both will order some. Great blended in coffee.",5
"I have used a few different brands of coconut oil and all say its organic, and the best it has to offer. I use mine for hair and moisture of skin. I have never cooked with it. But the nice texture of this is smooth and melts lovely with barely any effort of rubbing hands together. Glides easily over skin and abosrbs very well with skin or hair for a deep conditioning effect.. love the light scentI use coconut oil mostly in the winter and being in Northern Minnesota is get s very cold and dry here. It keep my skin happyThank you Viva Labs for the sample and i have now found my new Love for coconut oil again.",5
"I would recommend this product for its healthy and nutritionist benefits. It is the real thing, organic pure 100% quality coconut oil. I can bake, fried, make candy, make lotion, make soap, moisturize my body, hair, and face. I really enjoy the versatility of the product. I would purchase again when I run out. I do, however, think it's a bit pricey compare to my extra virgin olive oil in terms of quantity, so 4 out of 5 stars. Nevertheless, the versatilities and yummy scent makes this a terrific product for man, woman, and children.",4
"I wanted to try this as a facial moisturizer.  It seems to work well - but I do not know if this has anything to do with the quality of this product versus other coconut oils.  Came fast, good service.",4
i bought originally to make my own face cream...but then tasted it...SO delicious...a little bit stirred intoa cup of cocoa is so yummy...great product:),5
"I like this as the product arrived quickly and I am using it as an alternative to tooth paste.  It is early days, but I think it will provide the benefits I sought.",5
I am using this for my dry skin since because other brand name lotions or creams have ingredients that I am allergic to.  So far it is doing a very good a keeping my skin soft and to help it not dry out as much.  This was packed well and arrived on time.  I am very pleased with my purchase and would buy from this seller again.,4
"Great product (so far), this is a generous sized container for a decent price with great shipping!  As coconut oil is, it is a bit difficult to get out of the container without heating it but seems to be as stated.",5
"Coconut oil is great as a conditioner, for the skin, for internal health and to use in cooking. I've been using it for months now and absolutely love it.",5
"I hadn't planned to write a review, but Viva Labs asked for one, and because I did love it, I thought the least I could do was comply!  I got it for oil-pulling.  As others have noted, it's very pleasant stuff.  I even found myself spreading some on bread.  As for the oil pulling, I found that other oils sometimes irritated my throat a bit, but not this one.  I'll order more.",5
"I've been eying similar products at the grocery store, but they were all twice as much for the same amount. I planned on using this for skin, hair, and cooking. It's important if you want to use coconut oil for skin and hair that the oil is unrefined- as this is. It also smells and tastes delicious.",5
"Great as your night cream in desert areas. Also, moisturize your hair once a month. Makes it shine. And put a tbs. in your morning green drink.  Can you tell I LOVE IT !!",5
"I've tried other brands out there and this is by far my favorite. Pleasant mild taste, fresh, and slightly sweet.",5
"Very healthy with a wide range of uses this all natural coconut oil was exactly what I was looking for when searching for a natural and healthy substitute for canola oil, etc. Tastes and smells really good...I use this to fry eggs every morning and to grill chicken with. It has a higher cooking temp than olive oil, and is still a great source of healthy fats.-USDA certified organic-Non-GMO Project Verified-Certified Gluten-Free by GFCO-Quality Assurance International Certified Organic-Extra-Virgin cold-pressed-free of pesticides, trans fat, bleach, hexane.",5
"Let me start by saying that I use a lot of coconut oil, for many different things, and this is my favorite of the many brands I have tried. Compared with other coconut oils I have used, this one seems fresher and more smooth, if that makes sense. I have purchased other oils only to find some of them rancid or too thin, as if they were mixed with something else.Viva coconut oil has a very light, pleasant coconut smell with just a hint of flavor. It works well for cooking and baking and does not overpower other flavors. I have used it for several stir fry dishes as well as some delicious cookies. It is perfect for vegans and other health conscious eaters.I have also used it in my beauty routine. When applied before or after a shower, it acts as a skin moisturizer and it has had a wonderful skin evening effect. If applied before the shower, it also makes a great shaving cream! It is also perfect for removing make-up, including stubborn waterproof mascara. This may sound simple, but I have a Japanese mascara made for synchronized swimmers that is nearly impossible to remove without harsh chemicals. Yet, this coconut oil, melted in my hand and applied with a cotton ball, took it off gently and completely. It has also been a life-saver for my hair over the winter. In California, I ""winter"" weather is downright schizophrenic...though it is generally warm and dry, it sometimes slips into cold and dry or, occasionally, cold and wet.  As someone with naturally fine, dry, curly hair, this pretty much guarantees bad hair days and breakage. However, I tried putting a little of this coconut oil on the ends of my hair and noticed that it made my hair soft and easier to manage (ie. less frizz) without weighing it down. I eventually started using it as a kind of oil treatment before washes and my hair has been in excellent shape since! I have also been experimenting with using it as a base for homemade deodorant and toothpaste. The latter works well, but I've found mixing it with shea butter makes the deodorant more solid and easier to use.",5
Great product..good for skin and hair..and big cup too...would recommend it to any one who has rinkles on skin or dry skin..,5
"This stuff is truly incredible.  Does what it says and more.  I read that it can be an appetite inhibitor--I didn't believe it but much to my astounding surprise it truly is!  I take a tsp in the morning and tsp at lunch and I have noticed a significant reduction in cravings for between meal snacks.  Next benefit--I put it on my hair and leave in for about an hour-oh my gosh-the dryness that I was experiencing from the harsh Winter we are having is gone-and my hair is so shiny and easy to style-I had several people comment on it over the past week.  Also applied to my skin and it felt great.  I haven't tried it for cooking yet but that will be my next adventure,Great stuff-I am convinced!",5
"This really is some great coconut oil! I've had it a few days and have so far only have used it topically, on my own dry skin and on my baby's eczema. (I won't say it has healed the eczema but it certainly looks better.) I'm sure this oil will be delicious to eat/cook with. Very fine quality, pure and organic. Highly recommend.",5
Its good to eat straight and cook with. It is also nice to put in your hair and all over your body. It's better than the ones at the stores (at least in my town.) Well worth ordering from Amazon.,5
"I ordered this to try as a substitute for vegetable oil and it works great.  Unless it's hot outside, it needs a few seconds in the microwave to get into an oily form, but never has that nasty smell some oils get, and lasts a long, long time.  I also spooned some out into a separate container to use as lip softener - nothing works better to soften up dry lips.",5
The wonderful properties of coconut oil are important to good health and this product has a great texture (dense) and taste.,5
I bought this to use on my hair and body and I am sooooo amazed at how great this product is.  I highly recommend it!,5
Ordered thia because I live in a small town. My daughter had bad reactions to baby oragel so I mixed some doterra clove essential oil and this together and worked perfect even good enough to numb my brothers cavity,5
"I've been using this oil for about a week and I really like the way it has helped my hair get softer. My hair is normally dry, and I've put on the oil and let it sit for about 2 hrs before washing, and it has been much softer!",4
"Very good cream for the body and face. I like it because it mixes with other creams and can be used after swimming to alleviate dryness from the chlorine water. Although, I use it for dryness after showering or as a night cream too.It's best used for dry skin.",5
I love this product. My nails are finally growing again. I have dry heels so it is perfect to leave in the shower and use on my heels and legs. My dog even likes it as he wants to eat it. I haven't used in cooking yet but I plan on trying it.  Quick shipping was great.,5
"Before purchasing this product I bought some coconut oil at a local store. In reading the label I wasn't sure if it was best for using as a supplement so I purchased this Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. What a difference. It is creamy, it is cold pressed, it is delicious on toast without having to top it with honey or jam. I am using it strictly as a supplement and will be placing a second order.",5
"Coconut oil has been suggested for my husband who is suffering sort-term memory problems and what appears to be the beginning of dementia.  It's too soon to tell if taking a daily tablespoon is helping.  However, it sure satisfies my urge for something sweet.  A spoon with three or four dark chocolate chips and it's a healthy version of a Mound's Bar.  And if anyone has had any experience with memory and using coconut oil, please post a response.  Thanks.",5
"Nice creamy texture, I put it in my tea, and have read all the different ways to use coconut oil . Will be a staple in my kitchen now.",5
This coconut oil smells wonderful. I use it topically on my infant son for cradle cap and dry skin on his hands and it makes him smell like Samoa cookies! I take it by the tablespoon as a supplement.,5
"When Viva Labs offered to send me a review sample of their Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, I didn't know what I was getting into. ""Sure,"" I replied, ""I'll be glad to test it out and write a review."" At the time, I thought my wife and I could evaluate the oil during one of our weekend ethnic cooking marathons. Wrong! Well, partially wrong. Yes, you can cook with Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. But, based on the blurb here and the label on the jar, that's apparently just a minor sideline. What this oil is really intended for, we found out, is to smear all over your skin and hair, and/or to take neat as a dietary supplement.Ain't gonna happen. We've never been fans of skin and hair care products other than plain soap and water, and the idea of downing tablespoons full of thick oil creeps both of us out. So I'm forced to acknowledge that the sum total of our experience with this product is simply cooking with it. Even so, it sat in our kitchen for a few months until we got around to trying it as a frying and sauting substitute for the extra virgin olive oil that we normally use.So how does it work in that limited application? Well, we tried it yesterday to brown some really lean ground feral swine meat and other ingredients for Cuban picadillo, and to lightly saut some shrimp for our Super Bowl snacks. We found it works great for cooking. It melts almost instantly in the skillet, and does a good job of cooking onions to transparency, for example. It generated virtually no fond, however, which can be either good or bad, depending on what you're looking for. We had the heat set fairly low for our experiments, so we didn't get really deep browning of either the meat or the shrimp.To our tastes, Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is relatively light, despite the fact that it's solid at room temperature, and it imparts a subtle, but noticeable and quite pleasant, coconut quality to the foods we fried in it. Overall, we're very pleased with it, and we'll use the rest of it in the future as a viable alternative to other cooking oils. We expect its coconut character to be especially appropriate and deliciously discernible when we make South American, Carribbean or African meals.I'll leave it up to others to say how well it works for skin and hair care and as a dietary supplement, but for cooking, it's a five-star product. Enjoy!",5
"some of the new recipes used for gluten free bread has called for coconut oil.  It served the purpose for which it was purchased.  Along with coconut flour, the bread tasted wonderful.",4
If you want to cut the heavily processed corn/soy oil out of your diet coconut oil is what you need.  A Great product.,5
"I've never used coconut oil before.  I heard it worked well for skin rashes so I thought I'd give it a try.  I get a stubborn rash on my eyelids every winter.  There isn't much you can put on your eyelids for an entire season.  So far, I have had to resort to my prescription hydrocortisone MUCH less than usual!",4
"This product is great for the hair, the skin, and I love using it as a night cream. Once it is rubbed in, the ""oil"" is absorbed to there is no greasy feeling. Thanks! This product is MORE that I thought it would be.",5
I love this product. I bought the oil to use as a beauty product. I use it as a moisterizer for my face as well as for my son's excema. It  is wonderful because it moisterizes well without any greasy feeling. Also it has a pleasant coconut smell without being overpowering.,5
"I use this for oil pulling the teeth...similar to the way you use mouthwash, it is a natural bacteria killer to germs in the mouth.  I use it for eczema on myself and my kids giving instant natural non-steroidal results...helped within one use with the cracking, great for feet and elbows, and next I'll try it on my hair.  The smell is so pure.",5
"I wasn't sure what to expect at first. The product was frozen solid the day it was delivered (the high that day was 11 degrees). After it warmed to room temperature, it smelled fabulous! I have used it on my skin and hair so far and have been thrilled with it.",5
"I've had eczema ever since I was born, and so my skin isn't in the best shape. After applying the coconut oil on the afflicted areas it has really helped with moisturizing the areas affected by eczema. Not only does it help with moisturizing, but it feels nice and smooth afterwards. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is searching for a natural substitute for lotion. It melts in your hand as you scoop some out. The only downside is that the smell of coconut can be off-putting to anyone who does not like coconut. Personally, I don't like coconut myself but the smell is not too overwhelming.",5
"Great for the hair and skin. Works better than any hair product and being that it's natural, I can use it on my baby. Lovely scent too!",5
This coconut oil smells and works just as unrefined EVCO ought to do. The 16 oz size is reasonably priced and I was able to order it on Prime. Pleased!,4
"I have never tasted coconut oil before. It was recommended by Dr. Oz and the Junger Clean Cleanse, so I tried it and followed recipe for sauteed chard and mushrooms. The flavor is as rich as butter but has a different taste that I found excellent with the sauteed veggies. It is odd because at room temp the oil is solid (it does have a lot of saturated fat, but supposedly the health benefits used in moderation are good). I would recommend highly.",5
"I haven't used this product for very long so I can't comment on the health benefits; however, I can say that it has a nice flavor and I really like the coconutty flavor it imparts when sauteing with it. When cooking a small salmon steak it really kicked up the flavor so I didn't need to use salt or other enhancements.",5
"I really like this coconut oil!  It has a nice, pleasant, mild coconut scent.  It's not overpowering yet has just enough scent so you don't think you're using lard!  I will use it for just about all its intended purposes.  I love using it for popcorn!  It tastes just like movie theater popcorn!  I use it to saut or stir fry veggies.  Yum!  I've started eating a teaspoon of it every day to see if it helps with acid reflux, metabolism, etc.  I've rubbed it into my hands to relieve dry winter skin. It feels so silky smooth.  I think I'll try putting a little in my bath water with lavender essential oil to have a luxurious bath!I don't have a problem with dry or frizzy hair but am willing to give it a try as a premoisturizer since my hair is processed with color.  Certainly can't hurt!I highly recommend this product!",5
"I bought this jar for the sole purpose of deep conditioning my hair prior to shampooing although I also cook with it. This was my first purchase of this brand and I am very satisfied with it. The jar is plastic and sealed VERY tightly where I had to put in a little effort to rip the paper off once I unscrewed the lid, which is a plus! The fragrance is just amazing and you can tell this is the real stuff. I use coconut a lot for so many things, especially cooking and this made me want to cook up some platanos immediately :-) But on my hair, it went on smooth, wasn't runny and liquified where it wasn't functional and felt good on contact. I sleep with it in overnight with a cap and by am, it was still conditioning my hair very well and not just laying on my strands or pillow. For the price point, this is a very good hair product and I would venture to say for cooking purposes as well. Though I can't attest to that yet-hair jars are strictly hair and cooking jars stay in the kitchen.",5
This oil is excellent. I love using it on my hair for deep conditioning treatments. It keeps my hair shiny and moisturized.,5
I use this to cook everything because of olive oil's decomposition at high heat.  Some coconut oils are less pure and no longer have coconuty taste.  This one does.,5
This is a true find!!  I have used this for so many different things and has been amazing in every one of them!  Is now a MUST HAVE!,5
"five stars, i it came in glass container instead of plastic.  i didn't get the expected results other than  high hdl.",4
"This is the 4th brand of coconut oil I've tried and it is ""the one"".  Its texture puts it at the head of the pack.  Coconut oil is truly a wonder product.  Usually by this time of the winter my skin is a wreck, but making a simple sugar scrub with this stuff and using it 2-3 times a week in the shower (apply gently to wet skin, shower as usual, moisturize with CO after patting dry) has my skin looking, feeling (and smelling) wonderful! 1/2 Cup CO, 1 Cup table sugar combined with a teaspoon or two of vitamin E oil and 5 drops of lemon grass oil.  Mix thoroughly, store in airtight containers.",5
It tastes like coconut and has been great for the purpose I bought it for...oil pulling. Seems very natural and pleasant.,5
"So good on your skin. I have really bad dehydrosis eczema and this works better than my cortizone cream! All natural too. Also, it smells soooooooo good every time I put it on my hands I can't help but eat a little.I've tried other coconut oil brands and this is the best so far!",5
"I love this stuff.  You cook with it (it adds a great hint of coconut taste), use if for dry skin, and the recent book Grain Brain recommends taking a teaspoon of coconut oil per day to improve brain function.  It even works great for polishing shoes.  This brand is creamy and smooth. I have tried other brands which seem waxy and lumpy.",5
"Great product, great price. It does have a lot of air bubbles in it, but it makes easy to get out with your hand for moisturizing. Has been a great facial moisturizer for my sensitive skin. Dr. Tabor's revive face wash is a great for using before moisturizing.",5
"The best stuff!  I don't use it for cooking since my kids despise coconut (sigh...I love it!), but I use it for my hair and body.  For my hair, I use it pre-wash the night before.  I live in a dry climate so this helps my hair so much!",5
"I love it! I bought this due to the reviews and I have not been disappointed. I have used it for a moisturizer and skin cleanser and I love the way it makes my skin feel and the smell is amazing. I also love that when I told my kids that it is edible they didn't believe me, so I ate some and it blew them away. It tasted good too, so I am going to try to cook with it.",5
i gave it a 5 star because it helped with my skin from dryness.my son is using it too and we all love it..,5
"I use coconut oil for everything, from cooking to body moisturizer. This product is ideal for both - it's in a convenient-sized jar, too.",5
"Very good coconut oil!  Lower cost and organic!  I will order it again, it tastes great on toast instead of butter.",5
"This product can be used for a variety of different things. Whether it is for cooking or skin care, I highly recommend it. I would definitely purchase this product again.",5
"Never tried it before....love it, feels very good as a face and body lotion....have not tried it for cooking yet....highly recommend it.",5
Very nice...& I use it in my coffee. Great taste. Better then using sugar or other sweeteners. Plus it is healthy.,5
My whole family loves this!  We all have sensitive skin and It's wonderful on it.....leaves it feeling so soft with no irritation.,5
This stuff is great. I use it as a moisturizer and for deep conditioning of my hair. Lovely fragrance. Glad I gave this a try. I will order again,5
"This is my first time trying coconut oil as a moisturizer, and so far, I'm loving it.  Easy to apply to my skin, very little coconut smell, and my dry skin looks better already.  Will be back to buy more in the future.",5
"We purchased this product on a friend's recommendation for eczema. It smells great and I'm sure it works for other things like cooking and other people's skin problems but we didn't see any results. It came nicely packaged but it, also, came on the very last expected day which isn't like Amazon but oh well it won't stop me from ordering other things...",3
"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT WITH GREAT SUCCESS IN THE PREPARATION OF ALL TYPES OF FOODS.  I'M NOT MISSING BUTTER OR MARGARINE, AND IT ONLY TAKES A  SMALL AMOUNT IN THE PAN, SO IT'S ECONOMICAL TOO!  I've ALSO USED IT TO MAKE MUFFINS ( IN PLACE OF OTHER FATS ) WITH WONDERFUL RESULTS.",5
"great value, quality product. I use coconut oil for cooking and DIY beauty products/moisturizer and for pet care.  Can't beat the price. Great for buying in bulk.",5
"Tried this product on my hair a couple of times now, and it really made it soft and shiny.  The first time I used it I left it on for 30 mins and then shampooed my hair as usual.  The second time, I left it on overnight and shampooed the next morning.I haven't tried a lot in my cooking yet, but plan to do that, as well.The only thing I was disappointed about when I received the product is that they covered the label which detailed the different uses with the UPS tag!  But, found plenty of tips on the internet.",4
"I love this coconut oil! I have used it for a number of the intended purposes. It tastes great when ingested on its own! I have also used it as oil for cooking - Just today, I used it to fry scrambled eggs, and it did not at all taste coconut-y. I've also used it as a deep conditioner for my hair, after which it felt much softer! I will keep seeking out ways to use this coconut oil - It does not disappoint.",5
I love this brand of coconut oil. It's organic and still a grest price. Perfect consistency and it melts down and dissolves quickly when applied to skin. I use it on my daughter's exzema and it works wonders without harsh chemicals!,5
"I love it sooo much! bought it to use on my skin and hair, because i swim and so my hair and skin are always dry, and it feels so much better now.",5
"I bought this to mix with castor oil for my eyebrows and eyelashes. It has made them grow thicker and healthier, so I started using on my skin as well. I have dry, sensitive skin and this coconut oil is a perfect moisturizer! It's organic and has a smooth texture that absorbs quickly. I layer this under my regular night cream and it has helped brighten up my dry winter skin - plus it smells yummy too!",5
Great product. I've used it on my skin and also as a hair treatment. Soft hair and skin from something that smells great,5
"This is my first experience with coconut oil, which I am taking for health reasons after reading Dr. Fife's books.  I researched all the brands and chose Viva Labs because it met the criteria I was looking for (i.e., organic, non-GMO, unrefined, etc.).  I use it to replace all other fats and oils in my diet....I even put it on my toast.  I have to say, I am completely delighted with it.  I was not expecting it to taste so good.  It has a mild, pleasant taste that blends with any food and actually brings out the flavor of the food.  I also love the light coconut aroma.  Best of all, despite my history of  dietary problems, I find it easy to digest.",5
"I was told coconut oil was the best oil you can get for health reasons, so I am trying it out. Good so far, use it in place of other iols and you wont even notice a difference in taste.",5
"I have been using Viva Lab's organic extra virgin coconut oil  for only a few days and I am loving it. I could never imagine that I would be using oil on my face in the morning and it wouldn't feel greasy. My skil felt so much softer in just a few minutes after I first applied it. My skin does not flake any more and it is evenly toned. Will definitely try this oil on my hair, lips, nails and cuticles. And will definitely recommend it to my friends.Megi fromTbilisi,Georgia",5
"Great quality, and absolutely delicious. Fantastic on pastas and popcorn, and as a sandwich condiment. The smell and taste is so good, I would use this on almost anything.",5
"I use this product as a moisturizer and find it to be effective. Most coconut oil for your money, too. I recommend this over anything you can purchase at the grocery store.",5
"I love this oil, so good for my skin, I have psoriasis, so I use it on the very dry spots.",5
I absolutely love this product!  Great flavor and texture. I have used it in cooking & on my hair/skin. ;-),5
"As a member of Amazon Prime I received my Coconut Oil within 3 days, in a box with several other items. I opened the box with my 14 year old son and 2 year old grandaughter we were babysitting. We were smelling the herbal teas I had ordered and tasting the organinc honey and Celtic salt. When we got to the Coconut oil we all smelled the jar and it smelled wonderful. My son ask if he could taste some... not wanting to discourage him I said sure. His immediate response was ""creamy !"" Well his niece (who adores him) just had to have some as well. Monkey see,monkey do- she immediately pronounced it as creamy as well. So, I tried it and have to agree- creamy ! So there you have it.....haven't used it any further than that yet, but so far we all agree.",5
"This is a great product.  I have used it to cook, used it as a hair conditioner (the result was amazing), and used it as a skin moisturizer  I have even used it instead of mayo on a sandwich and loved the taste.  This is a great all-in-one product.",5
"This is my first experience using coconut oil. I use it on my hair, body, and also eat it. I am loving it! I will be ordering more soon.",5
My gf wanted this product as a natural facial mosturizer and so far it has really worked well.Thanks for an awesome product!,5
This brand smells good and fresh. I use it as skin moisturizer. I sometimes take a small bite and it tastes great too.,5
"I really love using this for everything (Hair, Body, cooking, diy self care products etc.) it's amazing! It smells great and the best part is it's organic.",5
I have very dry skin- and it gets destroyed at work. I have to wash my hands frequently.The coconut oil is great for my hands and it also softens my arms! It is oily when you first apply it but it soaks into your skin after a few minutes.,5
"I was given a sample in exchange for a review.  I was delighted to have the opportunity, because I'd been wanting an organic coconut oil I could use for cooking.  I already use a great deal of coconut oil for my skin care and soap making business.  I was skeptical the product would even arrive in decent condition, because it came on a hot afternoon in the late Arizona summer.  Not only was the product intact, there had been no leaks or spills.  When I unwrapped everything and opened the lid, the delicious fresh scent reached me first.  To find that the product was soft, but not liquid was astounding.I've used this on toast instead of butter.  I'm most prone to just serving myself a spoonful, not just as a dietary supplement, but to keep from snacking between meals.  I still intend to try it as a substitute for butter in my favorite cookie recipe.  But what surprises me most is the number of times I've recommended that friends buy this for their dry winter skin - use it straight - especially for people who love the scent of coconut and know how difficult it is to get this scent in a skin care product.I'm sold.",5
"I love it! My order was delivered very quickly, was well packaged, and feels wonderful on my skin! I have a lot of sensitivities when it comes to lotions and oils that I can use on my dry, cracked hands. A friend suggested coconut oil... amazing!! I would recommend this too anyone who is looking for a quality product.",5
"I bought the coconut primarily for my skin, and ended up trying it for hair as well.It leaves the skin so calmed, and smooth.The hair, I could say it's one of the best yet inexpensive masks out there!Not even kidding.My hair is processed and been through multiple hair dyes, however the coconut made it completely refreshed.Totally recommend.Worth all 5 stars!",5
Awesome product. Quick delivery. I use this product on my skin and hair. Love the smell. Will buy when this jar is empty.,5
"Especially in cooking -- fry veggies in it, microwave for 30sec and pour into baked good recipes. And this brand is a good value.",5
"I bought this to add to my smoothies, and it is just as described.  It seems fresh and adds good flavor.",4
"Love the fresh smell and taste of this coconut oil. It has a subtle coconut taste but not overpowering and has worked very well in cooking and baking. When I have melted it the oil is absolutely clear, some others have been a bit cloudy, which makes me thing this one might be a bit more pure. Try it, you'll like it!",5
"Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil is multipurpose: Cook with it, moisturize your skin with it, conditions your hair. Recommended, at least as a novelty item, and who knows, you may keep coming back for more.",4
"I love this! When I first opened the jar, I was shocked to see that it was in solid form.  But when you rub your hands together, it liquidifies to easily smooth onto skin. I have used in on my skin and in my hair.  Now I have my husband hooked on it as well. Will be buying this again and again.",5
"Wonderful smell, smooth texture. I'm using it on my rough skin and it's doing a great job. Give it a try.",5
Very nice coconut oil. I'm pleased with the order. It has a very pleasant smell and isn't greasy and reasonably priced.,5
"I bought this because I have psoriasis and I was reading that it could help with my scalp and skin. I've only had it for a little bit now and I've been using it on my skin daily after my shower. My psoriasis on my elbow went away. My knees look better. My scalp still has it but it has improved. I don't get a chance to use it on my head as much as I'd like to. I only have used it a few times on my head so far. My skin feels really soft. I also use it in place of butter for toast and oatmeal (as I read eating it can help psoriasis as well). I haven't been eating it daily, but I have been eating some about every other day. It tastes good.The only issue is that it's solid and sometimes hard to scoop out when I want to butter my toast. When I want to use it as a moisturizer I use my blow dryer to melt it. Once you get it in your hands it melts immediately.So far, it's a great product. I have a kitchen jar and a hair/skin jar. I used my first jar up almost and it's been only a couple of weeks.I will continue buying this product and hope it helps my scalp.My skin is happy. =)",5
Great product!!! I use coconut oil in everything and it's wonderful to know I'm using a quality product that's natural.,5
"I use coconut oil to make bath and body products, and this company offers a great product at an excellent price. I will definitely be ordering from them again!",5
"Delicious, smooth taste.  Best quality coconut oil I have tried so far.  Reasonably priced.  Offers so many health benefits- cold pressed, extra virgin.  Would definitely purchase again!",5
Very satisfied with this brand of unrefined coconut oil.  It smells and tastes yummy.  I love it blended it with coffee.,5
Excellent Organic oil.We use it daily which does not gets frozen during winter and it is easy to apply over the body.I recommend others buying this product.,5
"First, the clean taste. It is so much better than butter or margarine. My wife and I also use it as a hydrating skin cream.",5
I just got it tried it once it seems to be fine and it got great reviews and the price is just right for me.,5
"This is a great product better than what I had expected. It was great flavor, I used it for cooking and did not give it a heavy coconut flavor. I am excited to use it for baking.",5
First. It arrived fast. Second. It smells and tastes delicious. It's now the only coconut oil I'll use for cosmetics and cooking. Great product. Great price. Fast delivery. What's not love?,5
"great product that smells so good, makes me what to eat it... or coconut. perfect use on it's own and absorbs pretty quickly on skin even though it might feel a bit oily at first. I like to mix it shea butter for the best balance of texture skin applications",5
"I love it! Easy to use, no matter what activity you plan on using it for. Smells great, not over powering.",5
"Upon the advice of my daughter and daughter-in-law who are great advocates of coconut oil, I decided to try it.  Told to be sure and get the extra virgin I followed with my instructions.  I just love it.  I put it on my face every morning instead of the expensive moisturizer I have been using with better results.  It leaves my face soft and dewy.  I am over seventy and a firm believer in giving mother nature a little help here and there.  Good genes and following common sense beauty and health routines helps the aging advances.  I also scrambled my eggs using coconut oil after seeing a film on u tube on how to do it and it was delicious.  One more tip, my hair tends to dry so for a couple of hours before I wash it.  I put coconut oil on my hair and rub it in,  it does not have to an excessive amount, then wash it out.  My hair is then soft and shiny.So I have fell in love with my coconut oil good for you inside and out.",5
"This coconut oil is pretty good, only thing that I have that might be negative would be that it didn't smell like coconut as much as other brand I have tried. But it works good for all the things I buy it for, like skin and cooking with it. All in all it was a good purchase.",4
"I am using this for my hair. When you open the bottle you can smell pure coconut, which is refreshing. This product is so wonderful for your hair. I tried it and my Gaia became so soft and shiny. I will definitely recommend this to all who want to care for your hair.",5
"I had heard about coconut oil from Jenna Marbles' blog and from multiple users in the skin care addiction subreddit.  So I found this and decided to try it.  I LOVE it.  I put it on my clean face at night as a moisturizer (which felt really ""wrong"" at first...putting oil  on my face) but it really pays off.  By morning it has been fully absorbed by my skin.  I'll eat some by itself to curb my appetite (about 1/4 tbsp) and I use it as a body moisturizer.  You have to use a bit more (obviously) but I don't mind using alot for my body.  Leaves a really light coconut smell.  Not too overwhelming.  I've bought two of these so far and I'm quite certain I'll be purchasing more in the future.Tl;dr - it's excellence at a great price...get it...now.",5
This product is amazing!  I use it for my hair and I love it because it's not greasy and has a wonderfully sweet smell. I'll be buying it again in the future. The packaging was very adequate and delivery was prompt.,5
"The coconut oil was great for my hair. It made it feel extremely soft and moisturize. However, it didnt work well for my skin. After applying it to skin for many days, my face started peeling. Tons of red pimples started forming on my jaws, cheeks,my t-zone and forehead. Four pimples also formed on my right eyelid (which is very rare for me because I usually don't break out on my eyelids) My entire face feels very bumpy, even makeup doesn't cover it.  Not only that, but it's so itchy that I keep having to scratch my neck and face constantly. (I'm not sure if it's rashes or the pimples just itches really badly). If you have very sensitive skin like me then DON'T apply it to your skin. However, I do recommend this product for your hair though. In fact, I wouldn't buy this product again.",2
"Very pleased with the value of this pure, organic, very versatile coconut oil.  Love using this as a gentle moisturizer.",5
This is far better than other coconut oils we have used. The flavor is excellent - we don't use it for skin care but I imagine it would work well there also. Highly recommended.,5
"amazing product, using it in white sauces and thai food instead of coconut milk. Because it is just the oil, it is much more natural and taste is much better. Even tried it on skin, very smooth, great for dry hands.",5
"It's very natural makes my hair softer. It is not  a miracle product and it clogged my pores when i applied it on my skin, but it is great for hair and body. I scrub my legs with it and they get very smooth and soft. Love the smell too",5
"I love this product, it's very versatile and smells great. It works well as a moisturizer or for cooking. I would definitely buy it again!",5
"This is a high quality coconut oil and a very good value for the price.  I use it to rub on a sore knee every morning,which I swear works well for aches and pains.  It also makes a great moisturizer for winter's dry skin.  It also tastes delicious! The product looks very white and pure, and spreads easily once it is warmed up in my hands, since it's currently winter where I am and the oil is of course in its solid state.",5
I started using this product about a week ago and am very happy with the results. I'm using it as a moisturizer for my face and body. It has a pleasant smell and it's very easy and smooth to apply,5
"I love this stuff. It is nice and thick, smells like heaven and is obviously very high quality. It is awesome to put in coffee and has a very strong coconut flavor in comparison to other brands I have tried.",5
"product arrived timely and as described. there is a lot of product in the container, so it will last a long time...thanks!",5
I bought this for my husbands very dry skin.  So far so good!  It seems to be working very well and the price is much more reasonable than the very expensive moisturizer I would normally buy him!,4
"Smells great, tastes delicious. Great organic product. I love using coconut oil on a daily basis. This product is worth it.",5
I take a spoon full of this a day. It is very good and good for you. I cook with it and also put on my skin. Just rub it in and your skin is so soft. Really like this,5
This product was inexpensive and fit all my needs for a quality organic oil.I wanted to make homemade deodorant and this fit the bill exactly.,4
Nice smell.  Nice texture.  Fast shipping.  Works for everything you could ever dream up!  Great for skin and hair.  Even the dogs hair!,5
"Great stuff at a great price, especially for organic. I plan to use it for both my skin and my hair and I am very pleased with this purchase.",5
"I cannot tell the difference between Nutiva and this brand.  It costs less and is just as organic.  Buy it, save, win...",5
"I thought the price was pretty good, especially for extra virgin coconut oil.  I found the product a little dry, and there were some holes in the body of the product.  Not many but it didn't thrill me.",4
"Pretty much what I expected, just wish it didn't have the almondjoy candy bar smell...at least it's organic and does what I hoped. I would buy again.",5
"Jim,I bought this product to use on my skin.  So far, I used it on my arms and face.  It's only been a week since getting this, but I like it a lot and can see that I will probably be ordering it again in the future.",5
I have been using coconut oil for a while as a moisturizer and this stuff works amazingly. This brand in particular is really good.,5
"excellent moisturizer for skin, esp hands, and great for hair masks. for hair, apply to hair about half hour before shower and shampoo; hair comes out very smooth.",5
"Heard many good things so i researched and found this. Loooooooove this stuff! I use it as a moisturizer before bed each night ~ face and lips. Smells great, packaged well, and very happy with it :)",5
"I'm so in love with Viva Labs Coconut oil. Today I have already baked cookie, cooked breakfast, cleaned my dog, whitened my teeth, and deep conditioned my hair with it!!It's also amazing for a face lotion!! My daughter is now using Viva labs coconut oil for her dry skin.",5
"I bought this coconut oil to mix with some essential oils as a stuffy nose treatment for my infant.  It worked great for that. I used it for baby's cradle cap - great! Then I tried it on my chapped lips, dry hands and nasty heels and it's working for that too!Oh and I used some the other day while making orange chicken in the pan.  I loved the different flavor of the coconut.This stuff goes a loooong way, but as soon as it's gone, I'm ordering some more.",5
"I am a diehard Bronners fan...Their coconut oil is a go-to of mine for cooking, raw recipes, skin, hair, etc.  I purchased Viva Labs, thinking(pardon me), that I would use a slightly less quality oil for making my toothpaste.  Well, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that the quality is very close to, if not equal, to the Bronners oil!  I wouldn't hesitate to use this brand of oil for any, if not all of the things that I use the Bronners for!  Thank you for a wonderful product!",5
I love coconut oil. I received the package timely. The price was great.Very good product..you cna use it on many things.,5
"I have been using this produt for a while, now, and my face and body are so soft from Viva Lab Organic Extra Virgin Coconut oil. The softness of my skin is soothing, and healthy looking. Try it for yourself, and see the difference in fine lines and dryness of your face, your hands and your whole body. i will definitely purchase Viva Labs Organic Virgin oil Coconut oil again and again.  5 stars!",5
"My daughter started using it right away on her hair, face and eating a spoonful after she read of all the benefits. I will need to buy my own now...",5
I mainly use it as a moisturizer for skin and hair and it works way better than any other moisturizing creams. It smells great too. I will buy it again.,5
"I read about  the uses of coconut oil - healthy hair, skin, pulling , and a healthy alternative to other oils in baking and cooking so I decided to give it a try.  Not sure yet about the pulling since I just started, but healthy looking hair and skin and great for cooking/baking is true. Also, I found out that it is good for dogs; for their coat and generalized health, so I started giving the dogs 1 teaspoon with their food. They now eat their food right away - they appear to love the taste of the coconut oil.  Feeding 2 dogs was a problem - the larger dog always tried to eat the food given to the smaller dog because the smaller dog played with his food for a while before he ate it. Now, the small dog eats his food right away and the larger dog doesn't have a chance to eat more than needed (just a nice side effect of using the coconut oil with my 2 dogs).",5
This was a great product at a great deal. This is where I will buy my Coconut oil from now on,5
"Full disclosure, I received a complimentary sample from Viva Labs however I always try to give my honest opinion.Normally I buy Nutiva brand coconut oil and have liked it over many of the other brands I've tried and thus it tends to be what I compare all coconut oils to. Viva Labs is indistinguishable in quality and taste to Nutiva though. Both are organic certified extra virgin (cold pressed) oils. Company ethics seems fairly similar to Nutiva too so really for me it then comes down to price and convenience.Honestly the only reason I wouldn't switch (or use equally) Viva Labs coconut oil is the fact that I have an Amazon subscription to Nutiva so convenience and price win out here. A subscription is not an option currently with Viva Labs coconut oil.Otherwise if you're looking for another good coconut oil I would definitely highly recommend Viva Labs. :)",5
"Originally purchased as a skin moisturizer, but gradually started using it for the other so called Coconut oil uses - even tried cooking with it and interestingly it has a nice flavor to it.  If you even some doubts, order it and give it a shot--you won't be disappointed!",5
I purchased the coconut oil to make my own body butter. It is wonderful!! I have only made one batch but it is very easy to use & makes the body butter just melt right into my skin! Feels very decadent. There is a mildly greasy feeling but it soaks in fast & the greasiness is gone (that could be from the shea butter it's mixed with). Only gave it 4 stars as this is all I've used it for so far but it seems to do what it's supposed to!,4
"It's so gentle, that I can use it for my super sensitive and allergic skin without concern, and it absorbs quickly . I bought a coconut oil in Philippine (a local brand), and thought it was good, but I may not have a chance to buy a virgin coconut oil anywhere else. But the viva labs one is almost the same, and may even better! Though it smells like food, but I usually apply it in the evening, and the coconut smell goes away quickly.",5
"I've just started using this stuff for hair care, but everything about this product seems as promised. Delivered quickly and in good condition.",4
Great taste and texture and organic... love it!  Highly recommend... great price too!  My favorite brand I've run across!  Thank you!,5
"My wife loves it.  In fact, she was using organic coconut oil we purchased at the grocery for a while, and finds this product to be superior.  Oddly, the other coconut oil didn't really smell a lot like coconuts, the Viva oil does (that was her first comment).Coconut oil is a very healthy oil to cook with.  It also works great as a lotion, and is safe for children.  My wife says some spots on her arm are now fading after using the Viva oil.I've used it sparingly for dry patches on my skin, and it works well.  I like the idea of using a natural oil that is edible as a lotion, as your skin will absorb whatever you put on it, and what it absorbs will find its way into your bloodstream.  Due to this, we're trying to replace chemical-laden lotions, and this is a great way to go about it.",5
"I've been searching for a more bang for your buck coconut oil and this is definitely the one. This oil is super mild tasting and very nourishing to the skin. Also, I got my order earlier than expected so that's always a plus",5
This product is of very good quality. It tastes and smell like coconut. Its rich and creamy. I have used for cooking .,4
"I really love coconut and I  like this product. Coconut smell and flavor, plus oil texture equals paradise. I will keep buying.",5
I really enjoy  viva coconut oil. Delivery was on time and it is a awesome product. I would recommend this product any time,4
"This is my first time exposed to coconut oil.  I was looking for organic facial moisture product as I have been using Lancme and Este Lauder line all years.  My research online turned out to be pure coconut oil.  I was a bit skeptical as I know it's food that people eat, it's like putting rice/bread on your face :)  I like the purity and the deep penetration under the skin.  My skin is happy in the cold and dry winter nights.  The draw back is the greasiness and you might need to change pillow case more often.  I have not tried to use it during the day as I am not sure how to put make up over the oil.  So, to be fair, oil itself is 5 star.  As for my purpose of the oil, it's just a bit less.  If one day, I open to the idea of eating and put them on the face the same time, it will be re-rated for sure.",4
"I am super impressed with the quality of Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  It has a wonderful smell, the oil is so clear and pure and it is a wonderful product.  Will definitely be purchasing again.",5
Smells great.  I use for oil pulling and it works great.  I also use it for dry skin patches.  Good quality and shipped fast.,5
"I have only had this item a week or so and just recently decided to taste it and it tastes pretty good.  It is not sweet but it tastes like coconut and it is smooth.  I have read how good it is supposed to be for your hair, skin and cholesterol, so we will see.",4
"I LOVE COCONUT OIL!  I put this on my 5 month old daughter head to remove her cradle cap and its totally gone now. This stuff works wonders. I also use on diaper rash, rashes for my older children, hand cream, hair cream and I made the best cookies the other day, using this oil instead of butter! LOVE.",5
"I got this for my wife as she has eczema and is breast feeding our newborn daughter. Friends told her that this was supposed to help her with any chafing and breakouts on her nipples. Not only did it deal with any breakouts on her nipples, but it also helped heal the breakouts on her hands, simply by applying it! After that she started using it regularly, and we even used a tiny bit on our daughter's diaper rash and it cleared that up too! She uses it everyday and it continues to work wonderfully. Only negative I have is it smells like coconut, which you of course expect. I like the smell, but my wife is not such a fan of it, but it dissipates quickly.Would definitely purchase this again, and probably will.",5
"this coconut oil tastes really good. It is creamy and feel very pure, almost as if you are eating a fresh coconut.",5
Great product! You get a lot for your money. It smells amazing and is so good for your skin! Fast shipping!,5
It is really good just wish it was a little cheaper.  I put it on whole grain crackers and it was just like butter.,5
So far I have used this on my skin and hair.  I have curly hair and it is great for a conditioner.  Smells and taste great.  I will buy again.  It was also received very quickly.  Thank you.,5
"Great for cooking, skin care and hair care. I use it to bake cookies and for cooking chicken. I use it also in my hair conditioner for added moisture.  Great deal. Thanks!",5
"I have dry, frizzy, curly hair that needs heavy conditioning at least once a week. I have tried literally hundreds of products over the years and this coconut oil beats them all hands down. No need for heating either. Once you scoop some into your hand it turns to liquid. I put it on the ends of my hair and then rub some throughout. It is simply the best to provide moisture to dry, parched hair. I haven't used it on my face yet because it breaks out easily but works great on hands and arms. The smell is not strong and disappears quickly. Great stuff! I highly recommend it. If you're after soft, controllable hair - look no further!",5
"I really have nothing to complain about. I use this product for my hair, and I can notice a difference in how my hair feels.It's not that hard to wash out either.Aside from a hair conditioning treatment, I also use it as a makeup remover. Works great while moisturizing the area around my eye.I haven't had any issues with clogged pores.The only thing is, some people may not like the smell, but it's coconut. So don't get it if you can't stand coconut.",5
"I have now tried four different brands of Coconut Oil and decided this is my favorite. It is pure and virgin, and has a light taste. Some are too heavy. It has a light smell and is easy to mix into smoothies and drinks. It also is good for cooking because it doesn't overly flavor the food as some do.",5
"Great smell and coconut flavor. The best of the 4 different brands I have tried so far so I am done looking. This stuff rocks for pulling, eating and cooking.",5
"Fantastic product!!! Great price for such high quality product and large portion size. I love that it's non gmo certified, organic, extra virgin and cold pressed. Seriously can you get any better quality than that?? I love coconut oil for cooking, but it's so good for you too, rich in omega-6. They really took the time to make sure that you're getting the best product in its purest, cleanest form. 10/10 would buy again!",5
This jar comes with a good amount in it & has a very light coconut smell. It says oil but its in the jar hard so you have to scoop a little bit out and it rub hands and it emolliates into oil. This works amazing as a hair deep oil mask! I have slept in it and make sure you thoroughly wash out bc it can make your too shiny which just looks greasy. The results will leave a very shiny head of hair.I have really thick semi course being have asian/black and you could really tell the diffence after one use. I tried to see Iif it would would well as a hair serum and luckily tried this before bed bc it looked greasy but when I wokeup either my pillowrubbed it or it soaked in but my hair looked so shiny and healthy. It also works great as a all over mosturizer right out of the shower & even on your face. I've been told to use in food too but I'll prob buy another jar for that.,5
"I've used quite a few brands of coconut oil and figured why not try one more? Upon receiving Viva labs', I used it for everything from cooking, baking, and health care needs. I'm hooked. Consider yourself enlightened!!!",5
Forget all the others and start washing your face with coconut oil once a day. You won't believe the transformation!,5
"After reading about the benefits of coconut oil everywhere, I finally bought some and am so glad I did! I've been using it instead of olive oil in most of my cooking and it's delicious and of course healthy. I would definitely buy Viva Labs again - love that it's organic and GMO-free.",5
"I am really impressed with this product. I have used it in several ways. First, it is great on popcorn, and I have included it in smoothies and my hot teas. I have also used it as a part of by beauty routine by applying it to my face, hair, and hands. It is a great moisturizer. Finally, I use it regularly when oil pulling. Although too early to tell, I believe this will alleviate some of the toxins in my body and promote a healthier immune system. I expect to purchase more in the future when I get to the bottom of the jar.",5
"I ordered this coconut oil as an attempt at more natural deodorant. I had read coconut oil can suffice as deodorant, without the toxic aluminum of conventional sticks and sprays. Whether the fault is in the product itself, or that this type of coconut oil is not intended for deodorizing, or that my information is wrong, or that I'm applying it insufficiently..... I don't know.The jar of oil seems nice enough on it's own... The consistency is nice a creamy, and melts on your fingers, and it smells lovely: coco nutty, but not overpoweringly so. I suppose if you intend the oil for cooking or as a component of something else, then go ahead. I had no problems with the product reacting with anything or causing skin issue or whatnot. I just wish I knew why it doesn't mitigate BO like the glowing testimonials I read assured me it would. Oh well.",4
This is a terrific product....just wonderful for skin and hair.  If you use it mixed with oil of oregano it makes a fabulous hand santizer.  try this coconut oil...You'll love it!,5
"5 stars for this product.  It smells divine, feels wonderful, is safe for people and pets alike.  It is GMO free, organic, and I will be purchasing it again.",5
"I got this for the purpose of oil pulling. I've been doing it for about a week and already can see results. I prefer using this to toothpaste since it seems to work better for me. As an added bonus, it tastes wonderful and look forward to it every morning and evening. Apparently if you write a review, they donate money to charity so thats also really awesome",5
"Shipped very quickly,as for product have o my use for short while as in 4days but impress with quality of product.not greasy but great for hair,body and food.",4
I was so happy with this oil.  I use it for body and hair.  I'm sure I ill order again and again!,5
I have had many coconut oils.  I only buy organic extra virgin coconut oil.  This one rates right up there and will purchase again.,5
"This is a great coconut oil. The packaging is smart too with a large opening versus other brands.I use this for cooking as well as a body lotion, in my hair to repair split ends, on my face for smooth skin, to repair cuticles, heal sunburns - you name it!",5
This stuff freezes im kinda scared to walk out with it in my hair in the cold but other than that its great for pre treatment,4
"I had been using another brand of coconut oil.  I decided to give this one a try.  It is so much better than what I was used to.  The smell and taste is so much better.  No comparison!  I use coconut for oil pulling, eating for multiple health reasons, applying to my body and hair.  There is nothing like it.  As long as the price stays affordable I will be purchasing this product again.",5
"First of, I HATE coconut, so the smell is not awesome...but for you coconut people, it's probably the best smell. Anyways, I bought this because I read that this can help you thicken you eyelashes and I have been using this for two days already and I see an improvement in my eyelashes. WARNING: If it gets inside eye, it will not burn but it will make your vision a bit blurry.Anyways, great service, AMAZON PRIME so yeah. Try this out of you want fuller lashes.",5
"I massage about 1/2 a cup in my hair for about 30 minutes (then wash out) every couple of weeks and it does wonders for moisturizing. It's also amazing to cook with! No taste, smells delicious, and is way better for you than most other oils!",5
I have researched Coconut Oil as a supplement for dogs and decided to try it.  My dog loves it mixed in his food and the benefits are many.  Of the brands and sizes offered - I find Viva Labs product to be the best buy for the money and look forward to many years of good health for my Lab.,5
"Really works great on my skin and hair.  When it is in liquid form, it gets all over the container but if I keep it cold, its not a problem.  Overall Very happy with it.",5
"The smell and flavor are amazing!  It sampled it straight out of the jar.  That was a dangerously delicious idea.  It's my new favorite oil for pan frying, and when I get some on my hands while cooking, I just rub it into my skin.  Feels so smooth and supple.  :D",5
"Love this product. I made hand lotion, body lotion and eczema cream for my son so far. I really love it!",5
I love using this product in my emergency hair mask. A few tablespoons of this and an egg make for a hydrating heaven.,5
"*Disclaimer: I received a free sample of this oil and this is my honest review from using the product.*I know there are many uses for coconut oil. Mine so far have all been external. I have used it in my hair and I have short pixie haircut but enough to play with and I LOVE adding the oil to my hair after shower - I add it after it's dried a bit but still not very dry - I mix just about a tea spoon not much and I work the ends, and it's shiny and light and feels really nice. I don't use hair products anymore which is SUPER nice!I also have used this oil on my feet - they get extremely dry during the winter and I am practically barefoot all the time because I love doing yoga all the time and can't stand SOCKS. So, my feet got such a treat. I would use it at night but work it in really well so I don't get it on the sheets so about an hour or so before bed or I would rub it in the morning if I am staying home. Just be careful not to get too slippery while going down the stairs ;))Love the way this product feels and happy to concur with other reviews. I will continue using it and might just explore adding it to foods. Thank you Viva Labs!",5
"""pure"" is key word here. Highly recommended product. Couple tablespoons over your oatmeal in the morning, microwave, and it becomes like water. This is the best prevention of alzheimers based in a nutritional supplement!!!",5
"I use this product on a French Bulldog that has really bad allergies that cause her belly to get really red and inflammed.  I use this on her both in the morning and at night and have seen a difference in how her belly looks.  Since this is organic, both of my dogs love to lick the inside of the container and since it is safe for them, I let them enjoy a small sample.  I also use this on my legs after I get out of the shower to help with the dryness and to make them look a little thinner and shiner than they really are.  This product can be used for a wide variety of things!!!",4
"THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST AMAZING BODY MOSITURIZER WE HAVE EVER USED I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW AMAZINGLY AWESOME MY SKIN FEELS, THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW SOFT MY CALLOUS FEET FEEL AFTER JUST 3 USESI WANT TO BUY 1000 OF THESE AND SAVE THEM FOREVER THEY ARE THAT GOOD !!!!!!!!",5
"Besides using it for cooking, this coconut oil also works wonder as a moisturizer.  It leaves your skin soft and smooth; since it is natural you won't have to worry about putting chemicals on your skin.  All in all, an awesome product.",5
"I thought I would see what the hype was about with coconut oil, and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised so far. I bought a jar of coconut oil at the grocery, and was disappointed when I opened it because it did not smell like ANYTHING! I really wanted the coconut scent, so I jumped on the Amazon and found this! When I opened the jar, it smelled, well, tropical....yay Viva Labs! Although it doesn't do a great job moisturizing my skin (unless I put it on immediately post shower.....dripping wet), and I have to be VERY careful when applying it to my hair (as to not be confused with a 90's grunge fan), I love love love it for my face! It makes my skin so soft, but wait for it..........not oily! I have noticed by the end of the day though that my eyes begin to burn (just a little) if I rub them (I do put it on my eyelids and under eyes, so I'm assuming it's from it getting in my eyeballs). Ever fried pork chops in coconut oil? If not...you must! They turned out super moist (which is hard to accomplish for me), and it smelled oh so tasty in my kitchen! I did try a spoonful right out of the jar, and it didn't taste as bad as I anticipated it would, but something about solidified oil on the tongue doesn't settle well with me. On the upside, it does melt super fast! It doesn't taste bad by any means, just weird. It has a light coconutty scent and flavor. Overall, I believe I will be utilizing the coconut oil consistently.",4
I purchased this to make some hand cream. It smells wonderful. Very smooth texture. High quality. Everyone loves the scent it gives the cream. I will definitely be buying more.,5
"I bought this oil for a skin moisturizer. It comes out easily if you scoop with a Qtip. After a few seconds of rubbing it in your hands, it turns into oil which then goes on smooth wonderfully. It is a great moisturizer and I love the coconut scent.",5
I love this oil it's so nice and it's organic I use it for my hair and skin sometimes really great,5
"I bought this to use on my face, it feels a little too oily but maybe im using too much. It smells soo good and taste good as well. will recommend and buy again.",4
"GREAT smell, fresh, coconut smell. Soften my skin very very well, and i'm going to use it on my hair!",5
"The aroma/fragrance is a perfect balance compared to other brands. No overpowering coconut smell, but has no third-party taste to it either. I use it as a supplement once a day, as well as using it for most cooking needs. I only wish it came in larger sizes!",5
"This is amazing in every way....taste, smell, texture.  I have used it in cooking, given a bit to my dogs for their coat, used it as a moisturizer and nibbled on it too.  My new favorite find!",4
This product is really good and the price was definitely reasonable compared to some other brands. We use it for cooking as a replacement for butter in my house and the whole family enjoys it!,5
Arrived on time.  Product is just how it's described. Love the scent! I used this product in homemade lotion and it made my skin really smooth. Will order again as soon as I run out!!,5
"I read an interesting article about all the money that can be saved by switching almost all your beauty products to Coconut Oil. Skeptical but tried it anyway. Based on all the other reviews, I purchased Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil and am so glad I did.This stuff is amazing! I've tried it on my hair, body and face. It leaves my skin super soft. It's not too oily once it's all absorbed. I'm used to using silky oil based moisturizers and this absorbs better than anything I've ever tried. In the shower, I use it to shave. It keeps my skin nick free and again, silky smooth and soft.Now, if you have thick coarse hair like me, this next bit is worth your time. I put some on my ends, and smooth a bit more onto my hair. After a few days, I wash it out and my hair is super smooth, without frizz. Yes, I only wash my hair twice a week and this keeps it looking smooth between washes. This sealed the deal for me. I'm sold and will continue to purchase this amazing coconut oil!",5
"I really love this product, it has taken the place of butter in my diet, the taste and smell iis refreshing,  I would  not hesitate to reorder again.",5
bought it to get rid of dry scalp. worked better than anything else i have tried and gives my hair a silky shine.,5
"This is the best tasting coconut oil ever! I've tried many. This one doesn't take over the flavor of other things -- and it's delicious and smooth, perfect for eating it straight from the spoon. Highly recommended!",5
"This is my first time trying this brand, and already I know this will be my go-to coconut oil. I used to buy another organic brand from the super market, but it didn't smell like coconut, and it had small white lumps that would never seem to dissolve. This oil is smooth and smells great. My skin and hair love it already.",5
"I got this for my one year old's eczema break out on her face (near her mouth, so my remedies are limited).  Great smell and worked great!  After reading other reviews, can't wait to use this on my hair and even in cooking!  I will definitely be ordering more!",5
Quick shipment! Got this product and read a suggestion for a hair mask on the side. Tried it out and... daang i could actually tell a difference in my hair! Which has never happened with any professional hair treatment product. In addition my dog and i enjoy the occasional spoonful and its also! a great tattoo lotion. My next order will be an industrial sized tub. What can't you do with 100% extra virgin coconut oil?! I've also been told it's the tops for frying.,5
Excellent product! great for the hair when is very damaged and dry. Also great for cooking recipes like cookies or cakes.,5
Great for cooking (especially popcorn) and for use on skin.  Worth every penny if coconut oil is what you need.,5
I love this product.  It smells fantastic.  I put it on my skin to protect it before I swim in a chlorinated pool.  It goes on smoothly.  I chose this when I decided not to put any artificial chemical products on my skin anymore.  I'll never go back!  I highly recommend it.,5
"I bought this product after carefully reviewing coconut oils and what to shop for when choosing. This product smells amazing but in a very light coconut way. I love it, how it smoothes my split ends, softens my heels of my feet and to top it all off I purchased 2 so I can cook with the other. It is great in a curry soup or stir fry at a medium temp. Overall I am completely satisfied with the speedy delivery and the overall product. I am hooked and will be ordering more!!",5
"I've never used coconut oil before but after using it for just a few weeks I've noticed a huge difference in the feel of my skin. It is just so frigging soft! I love it!! It also smells good. It has a very light, soft smell of coconut. I know it has many more uses than just to soften skin and I'm sure I'll be trying many more. Awesome product that I will be buying again!",5
It smells wonderful and feels so nice on both my skin and my hair.  I love it! I will definitely be buying more when I run out.  Not too expensive either for the amount you get!,5
"Viva Organic Coconut Oil is good for baking and some cooking.  There is some sweetness associated with the taste.  I even eat 1 T morning and night to speed-up my metabolism.  Sometimes I use it on my hands when they are seriously chapped.  I've even used it as a face cream to to moisturize my scalp.  You can't go wrong buying this oil for yourself.  I love it!D. YoungLouisville, KY",5
"I LOVE this product!! I use it for everything - My hair, skin, cooking, tea, smoothies, you name it.  I will be ordering this again and can't recommend this enough!",5
I bought this for skin care but I know there are numerous uses and I can't wait to try them,4
fast delivery and what a great product.  I will definitely order more from Viva Labs.  Plan on using for skincare/haircare/cooking,5
Smooth and easy to use. I mixed it with other product for my hair and it is a great moisturizer,5
"This is probably the 7th time I've bought a coconut oil product and I am pleased to report that I believe this is the one I will stay with. The flavor is a tad bit better than all the others I've tried, but what I do like best is the room temperature consistency.It's soft enough to get any amount you need without scraping hard stuff.It's hard enough to not be oily right out of the jar. I use it mostly as a supplement, but have used it as a hair moisturizer and it makes my hair soft and pliable. Using coconut oil for me is also a preventative step because my sister came down with shingles and its something I never want to experience.I had a naturopath advise my sis to take a tbs daily for a year to keep it from returning, so I use it hoping I never get it. You can do online research for all the great benefits of coconut oil and viva labs makes a really good product...IMHO",4
"I bought this to use on my skin.  I really like it so far, it smells nice and makes my skin very soft.",5
"First of all, since the oil isn't runny at room temperature, storing it is great. Second, it warms right up when applied to a warm surface, so makes for a great skin treatment.",5
"Great quality, and tons of uses.  We use as a cloth safe diaper creme, moisturizer for baby, lip balm, on dry feet and elbows.",5
"I purchased Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut oil initially to use for popping corn in my stove top popper. The oil is solid at room temp, but quickly turns to liquid, when put on a very low temp in the pot. It also liquifies if you put it in your hands or bring it just below room temp. It worked very well in my popper. The oil is very good for your skin and hair as well.",5
First time I have ever used Coconut Oil and I bought this one based on great reviews so I have no prior knowledge of product in general but am very happy with it. Have used on skin & hair so far & I love it!,5
I use this in my hair about once a week and my skin (not face) every night. It works wonders on dry hands and feet. I use it on my kids when they get really chapped lips and it works great for them as well.,5
Super fast delivery and it's in perfect condition.  I'm using it skin care after reading about it and It's simply amazing.,5
"I love this stuff! There are so many uses, I bought it for skin care, but I have used it for many more things since. It is a great chap stick also!",5
"This product is very light, goes on smooth and smells wonderful.  I've used it on my skin and it leaves it so soft.  I have also used it on my natural hair.  The coconut fragrance is not strong and my hair has a luxurious shine.  I would highly recommend this product.",5
I've only use this coconut oil for a couple of days on my skin and already I see and feel a difference. I plan to use it in my health drinks. So happy I finally purchased this.,5
"smells delicious too, best coconut oil I've used for skin care, smooth and creamy, great for cooking and baking also",5
"this product is really good for you, inside and out. apply on skin or hair, use for cooking/baking. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!!",5
This product is amazing. I use it in my hair weekly as a mask as well as with brown sugar and honey for a body scrub.,5
"I recently purchased this product and my family absolutely loves it! I use it and it smelled so good on me that my husband and an my two year old daughter had to try it...they're hooked! I have to order more because we are replacing all our lotions. The smell is wonderful! The oil is so smooth and the skin just absorbs it so it is not oily, just soft. I'm going to try it on my 5 month old baby to see if it will help with her eczema.",5
This coconut oil arrived very quickly.  I've only been using it for a little while but I love the way it smells.  I've been using it more for my skin (absorbs quickly) and I will be trying it for cooking as well.  I'm glad I tried it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start using more natural products.,4
"I am in love with this product, so far I have used it on my hair and in my coffee. I will order again.",5
"I primarily bought this for moisturizing my skin.  It's a little hard to get out of the container and it takes some time to fully absorb into your skin so you can't apply it if you are in a hurry to leave, but overall, it has been working great as a moisturizer.  I have not tried any other types of coconut oil, so unfortunately I don't have anything else to compare this one too.",4
Excellent product.  Arrived fresh and pure.  This oil is excellent for skin and hair.  I would recommend this product for anyone wanting  relief from dry winter skin.,5
"Wow, this oil smells so delicious I couldn't help but scoop up a bit to taste, yum!  So natural, like smelling a just-cracked coconut.  Bet this would be good to use in cooking or smoothies, but so far I've just used it as a skin cream.  Works well, although the moisture doesn't remain on the lips for long, soaks in, which is probably a good thing.  I would buy this oil just to smell the scrumptious scent!",5
"I was wary at first that coconut oil might be a fad, but after trying this product, I quite like it. It works well and absorbs in to your skin without making you feel like a grease ball. It hardly has any scent which is nice, because I don't like choking on strong smells. It's also quite cool how this stuff only melts above 76 degrees, because it means you don't ever pull out a glob that was just way too big and waste it. I highly recommend trying this product if you are interested.",5
My muffin recipe called for coconut oil. I used this product and the muffins tasted fantastic! My husband's hard to please when it comes to muffins and he loved them.,5
"Great for infant massage, infant moisturizer/dry skin. Makes my baby smell delicious! Also has been great for my dry patches as well, and i've only had it for 2 days! Highly recommend. Also it's going to last us a long time!",5
"I am a serious consumer of coconut oil. I chose Viva Brand because of it's organic properties. It works well but it is not as soft as I would prefer. Even if it is room temperature, it is a very solid product.",3
Love this coconut oil! I use it for cooking as well as a weekly hair mask. Definitely recommend it as it's so versatile.,5
"The uses for coconut oil are beyond endless. Just google it; you can use it for skin care, baking, hair conditioner, oil pulling, etc. I use a small amount in my smoothies daily, just started oil pulling, and use it in my homemade body scrub. I prefer viva labs because I trust their products and I know it is truly organic and extra virgin. Amazing!",5
"I received the product very promptly. I have only been taking it for about 2 days, so I am not noticing to much of a difference yet but it taste pretty good..there isnt much coconut taste to it. I also rubbed it on my skin and to my surprise it absorbed quickly and it wasn't greasy at all. I will order again.",5
Fast delivery and arrived in good condition. Have heard great things about coconut oil...can't wait to incorporate it into my every day life!,5
Loved this product.  Exactly what I was looking for!  I was looking for this product in the stores and found it on Amazon!,5
"I got this oil to make my own body butter. It has a very nice smell and texture. The body butter turned out wonderful. I am really happy with this product, so far. I would recommend it to others who are making their won lotions and body butters.",5
"I bought this originally to add to my smoothies in the morning. While I was making a smoothie one morning I notice that they offered tips on using this oil as a deep conditioner. So I applied 1tbs on my dry hair and then followed with a simple shampoo and conditioner. This product is amazing, I didn't even have to use a leave in conditioner I applied a dimes worth on my scalp, blow tried my hair and 5 days later....I have no dry,itchy scalp instead I have shiny and soft hair!",5
Love this product has grwat smell and is light in not weighing the hair down and it also feels good on the skin,5
This is the best coconut oil I've ever used!  Works great in my smoothies and on my skin.  Very pleasant smell.,5
"Ever since I heard how beneficial coconut oil can be for you inside and out I decided to try it out. It works great for cooking and being someone with sensitive skin, this product is magical for my face and body. I even use it in my hair for extra moisture. It's a great size container and not expensive at all! The main thing is that its virgin coconut oil, that's it, no other ingredients that I cant pronounce. So, I know exactly what I'm putting on myself (if using for moisture) and in myself (if using for cooking). I am very satisfied",5
"I have tried a few different coconut oils, including all the popular ones.  This is the BEST one yet.  The smell itself is fantastic!  Some coconut oils are gritty but this is completely smooth and easy to melt.  I used it first as a hair conditioner and my hair is much softer.  I have not used it for cooking, only as a hair and skin moisturizer.  I will continue to buy this brand, it is a good price too.  Very impressed!",5
"this is the real deal of  organic coconut oil it's been put to use for all purposes, love to  cook with it , used for hair care, the best for conditioning dry winter hair!Truly hydrating to cracked dry northeastern winter skin!Results can appear after just a few applications! It can be very mood lifting to get a litetral taste of the tropics, the aroma, taste and smell are truly beneficial! I bragged about it so much I bought some for gift giving!",5
"I use this oil in my protein shakes for the most part or oatmeal in the morning. It tastes great, and I feel it adds to my already healthy lifestyle.",5
"Not only does this taste amazing and it's great for healthy cooking, but it is helping my natural hair and it's split ends problem",5
This is the first coconut oil I have bought. It seems to work well for my needs. I also just started oil pulling which is swishing the oil in my mouth for several minutes to pull the toxins out of my body. The taste is natural and I am assuming it is working as well as any other oils. Thanks~! I was also delivered timely.,5
"I decided to try this for the apparent health benefits and have found that I actually love the taste in cooking, even when I scramble eggs.  So far I've used it when baking/frying/broiling/grilling various meats, fowl and fish.  While I'm enjoying them all, the biggest surprise for me is with salmon.... I've found that frying salmon with coconut oil definitely reduces the ""fishy"" taste that has kept me from eating that Omega 3-rich fish as often as I probably should.  With this new taste, I'm now preparing salmon once a week instead of bi-monthly.  Better taste + better health prospects makes this my new staple for food preparation.",5
"This stuff is AMAZING. A little goes a long way. I use it on my body, my face, my hair, and in my protein shakes. My skin issues (breakouts, dry skin) have disappeared nod my skin is looking better than it has in years. I've been searching for something that would get me these results for years!!",5
"I've been on a big health kick lately. First, the green smoothies, then the quinoa, and then the cooking oil. I was pretty shocked to read article after article about how cooking with olive oil actually putrefies it and turns it into a carcinogen! Woe. So I cook with this coconut oil and still keep the olive oil around to put in my salads raw.The taste is magnificent! A little hint of coconut in the food but nothing to make you remember the beach and that pina colada. It has a sort of refreshing feeling to it as well... like you can feel the oil melting in your mouth.Hey... and it is organic. :D",5
I can get good coconut oil from the local health food store but I wanted the best tasting coconut oil I could get because I want to reap the benefits of using it everyday. I have read about some people using coconut oil instead of butter but this is the first coconut oil where I can see using it that way. The other family members like the taste so much that we have gone through the first order of two jars in two weeks.,5
"I have been meaning to add coconut oil to my diet for quite some time, and finally got around to it. This brand seems to be a good choice since it is cold pressed, which is something to look for when purchasing coconut oil. Overall I would buy it again, as this will become part of my daily routine. Do yourself a favor and research the benefits of coconut oil in your diet.",5
"This was my first time using organic coconut oil I have used in for my hair, skin, and cooking. I have been very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it often.",4
"If you have not yet tried coconut oil in your baking, dont be put off by the thought of ""coconut"".Out of the jar the coconut oil has the consistency of a product like crisco but with no flavor.  You can melt in quickly in the microwave and use it in place of most any recipe that calls for vegetable oil.Unlike most vegetable oils, Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is not hydrogenated.  It is much better for your health!You can also use it for cooking on the stove top.A very versitile oil!",5
"My family and I have been using coconut oil in place of our lotions/moisturizers/etc and so far we really like it. It moisturizes well and isn't too greasy (considering what it is). I haven't cooked with it, so I can't give my opinion on that just yet. All in all, I've been pleased.",4
"I haven't used this for very long but I can say that it has been great so far.  I have only used this as a moisturizer for my skin and hair and like the results so far.  The only suggestion I have is that if you do use this on your body, be sure to wait a few minutes and then to put on clothing to cover the areas the oil is on.  It is very ""greasy"" and probably would be tough to remove from couches, chairs, etc...",5
"After reading an article on coconut oil and it's softening effect on hair, I decided to try it. My old gray hair is NOT soft. After using as directed, wearing a shower cap for 1 hour after application, I am impressed. 3 treatments and my hair does feel softer!I also tried it on an area on my arm that has always had a sandpaper feel. Now soft and smooth!Give coconut oil a try. Usea as directed and the results should be great for you too",5
"Very happy with the viva labs organic extra virgin coconut oil. I use it for the body and also on the face, it keeps the skin smooth and soft, better than any cream or product. For sure will order more for the whole family, excellent product, organic, perfect for everyone. 5 stars!!!!!",5
I use this product for something called oil pulling --its a oral thing. I also use it for thin hair --so far so good --the oil pulling has made my teeth very white in only two days -- I will be ordering again.,5
I had a horrible reaction of a peel and had many chemical burns on my face.  In 24 hours my face was so much better and great after 36 hours.  I love this stuff.  And this tub will last me forever!,5
Cocunut oil is perfect for cooking. It can stand up to high heat. And doesn't impart too much coconut flavor in your recipes. Viva Labs brand is a great brand to buy your coconut oil from.,5
I received this in exchange for my honest review.I'm happy I accepted the offer because this is the best coconut oil I've ever tasted -- including the fresh coconut oil I purchased in the Caribbean.I use it all the time in cooking as a substitute for other oils or butter.  It adds a really nice coconut taste to whatever you're cooking.I particularly like it when making jasmine rice.  One teaspoon is enough to flavor 1 cup of rice.There's no doubt that when I run out I'll buy this product again.,5
I have been using coconut oil for a while now...I love it. It gives me energy all day. I like this kind. But I am going through the jar way to fast. I think I paid about $12 for it and I am going to have to switch to a brand I get a Sam's club. Only because it is a better price and I need to think of the money. But this stuff tastes great.,4
Google 100 ways to use coconut oil. That's why I purchased. Buy it. Use it. Enjoy. Many many uses you'd be surprised.,5
"This is very good coconut oil.  We use it not only for cooking and as a spread, but we also put some in our dog's food a couple times per week for his dry skin.  Good value.  Great product.",5
I love this coconut oil.  It is a great mosturizer for my skin and absorbs almost immediately.  I love the light coconut aroma as well.  Much easier to use in this tub than the bottles I'm used to buying where you have to figure out a way to soften or melt the oil to get it out.  Great price as well.,5
"Wanted to try after reading this: [...]At first I thought it was weird because of how hard and solid it is.  But as I got out small pieces, it suprisingly quickly melted and became a liquid to apply and use.  Once it touches skin it won't be so solid.Then it worked out great.  Love that it's all natural and no chemicals when I apply.  The smell is exactly what you would expect.",4
"The coconut oil arrived quickly.  The product is wonderful, and feels great on the skin.  I've shared with several friends.  It's got a wonderful smell. You can tell it's a quality product.  I would definitely order again.",5
"I've only owned the product about 3 days and fell in love with it already! I love the raw coconut smell, I never get tired of it. I use it for tooth pulling which gets rid of cavities and honestly, my teeth are already whiter and my teeth feel better. They feel stronger and coconut oil period is the go to item but Viva labs is affordable and I'm happy and satisfied about my choice. I was skeptical at first but now when ever I run out I'm getting Viva Labs again",5
"I use it to cook with, to moisturizer mine and my toddler's skin. I use it as a conditioner.I highly recommend this product.",5
I used the oil to make chicken in a skillet and it worked great. there was no odd aftertaste. I look forward to using this more often instead of olive oil or butter,4
Love this product ...great for all uses ..hair skin and health!!! Delicious in my coffee ...smells great on my skin and makes my hair silky !!! Lifetime product!!,5
I am a huge fan of coconut oil! I use it on my skin to moisturize my skin. I have tried other brand but I really love the quality of this brand.,5
"I have bought other brands of coconut oil in the past, but this brand trumped them all.  The smell (while cooking) and taste were so distinctively coconut.  Not only do I love it, but coconut oil is so very good for a person!!",5
"i am loving this product, great for skin, hair, and cooking....i gave it 5stars because it really is a Super Star of Coconut Oils!",5
"Viva Labs Coconut Oil is 100% certified organic and pure, so that's definitely a steal for the price.  I'd expect to pay twice as much simply based on its many claims and the fact that it is 100% organic.The taste is a very mild coconut flavor, not sweet, that does not linger in the mouth for long. Though the first use listed on the container is taking a tablespoon 1 to 4 times a day as a supplement, be careful.  The word supplement gets thrown around a lot so just know what you are supplementing.  After all, this coconut oil has 125 calories per tablespoon.  22% of those calories are from fat. this product is very high in lauric acid, caprylic acid, and capric acid, along with Omega-6 and Omega-9.Your body can synthesize Omega 9 which is good for raising good cholesterol and controlling blood pressure, but you also get 9 from many other sources like olive or peanut oil. As far as Omega 6 goes, your body does not synthesize it. It has many benefits and is found in many other oils, like fish or walnut oil, so if you cook with coconut oil it's a good way to pick up this acid.As far as cooking goes, again, the coconut flavor doesn't linger in the food but it is there.  You might try this with chicken or fish, mixed vegetables, stir fry, or other ""sweet"" foods that you'd normally find with coconut as an ingredient.Others have mentioned the skin and hair care benefits, so I won't repeat those.  They add to the multi-functional benefits of this product and make it only that more appealing.  It's definitely a great, multi-purpose product, with a great price!",4
"One of the great things about coconut oil is its versatility.  I haven't yet used mine for many of the functions it fulfills, using it almost exclusively to help treat my baby girl's cradle cap.  However, that's what is great about this product.  It is gentle and has been very useful in helping to treat that little bit of cradle cap on top of her head.",4
Good stuff-- Me I B using this for STIR FRY-- and it works quite well--healthy and can take the heat. Will I buy this again??!!4 sure--the 11 commandment--Thou shalt use good stuff.,5
"Yes....shaving!!I was given the opportunity to test out a full size jar of this stuff.  My initial thoughts were to use it somehow with baking or cooking or even a smoothie, but I just couldn't find the right application.  So instead I thought that I would give it a try as a health care/beauty item.First I tried it as a simple lip balm.  The smell and taste are smooth and mild.  However, given that the melting point for coconut oil is pretty low, this just didn't sit on my lips the way a traditional balm does.  Then I tried it as a shaving cream replacement at the suggestion of other users of coconut oil, and can I say WOW!  I have terribly sensitive, dry, itchy skin on my legs...so much so that I turn into a human version of a sasquatch from about October through May every year just to avoid the feeling shaving in winter gives me.  Traditional shaving cream and a follow up with traditional moisturizer just don't save me from days worth of skin irritation and itch, so for years every fall and winter my legs go in complete hiding.  BUT- this stuff saved me from that!  No days of itching after shaving, no wanting to take a steel wire brush to the backs of my knees from the razor burn sensation.  And it really got an excellent close shave and left my skin super soft for days.Downside- it's messy.  Again, that melting point plays a roll, but it doesn't drip off.  Instead, it will reharden in your tub unless you scour the tub immediately after shaving.  It's also not very easy to scoop out from the jar for this purpose.  However, none of these things take away from getting a great shave that doesn't make you want to peel off your skin for days after!",4
"I love coconut oil, and I chose this product because it was a good price for a large quantity AND it's organic.  While I do enjoy using it to cook, I mostly use it for hair and skin care.  I have found that a very small amount goes a long way and moisturizes my skin very well.  It helps with winter chapped lips too.This tub is gonna last me a long time!  It is useful that it comes in a tub because when it starts running lower you can still reach your hand in to get the last of it out.  It would be ideal if it came in a glass jar, but at least it is BPA free.I use it as a moisturizer for my face.  It never makes me break out or have any irritation.  I have rosacea and mild adult acne so it is important to me that my skin care products are soothing.  Combined with my tea tree oil face wash, I don't have very much redness or acne anymore!  For my hair, I add a tiny amount after showering as a base for applying hair product.  My curly hair stays frizz free and shiny.  I noticed the tub has several suggested uses as well as nutritional information, which is a good feature.  I am a big fan of products that have tips and tricks, or even just fun facts.  I will definitely buy this product again as long as the price stays low.",5
"This coconut oil is smooth, easy to use. I have stir fried with it - perfect, cooked eggs over easy and scrambled. Very nice product",5
I have always bought Garden of Life or Dr Bonner's coconut oil and gave Viva labs a chance due to great price....and I am very pleased. High quality product just as good if not better than other brands I have used in the past. I will definitely buy this brand again in the future.,5
This is one of the best Coconut Oil products I have ever used.  Excellent quality.Great for popping corn.  I also use this as a beauty product.,5
"This product is wonderful!  I didn't realize that coconut oil is a solid at room temp - kinda neat!  Now, I'm going to tell you what I use it for...I have two potbellied pigs and they have super dry and itchy skin.  This is perfect for them.  We apply it externally and give them a small amount of it (smaller than a pea) every day with one of their meals.  They are glowing!",5
"I ordered this product after reading so much about the benefits of coconut oil on skin. It truly works and when you put some on your face it feels amazing. My skin is already softer, pores reduced, and fine lines have diminished after just a week. In addition I use the oil to smooth out the frizz from my hair and for cooking with instead of using butter. I would reccommend this product to anyone.  Please note that when you open it, it does required a spoon to start into it.  Once your hands touch it though, it starts to liquefy and is easy to mix with other moisterizers or makeup.",5
"I chose this coconut oil because I wanted to use it for both cooking and health/beauty purposes (homemade moisturizer). The package came very quickly, was reasonably priced, and is a good quality. Would purchase again.",5
It's a great product at a great price point. There's absolutely no need to look elsewhere if you have amazon prime.,5
"I bought this coconut oil to make body creams with the beeswax from our hives. After all the work of extracting and filtering the wax, I wanted a high-quality oil to compliment it. I love everything about the Viva Labs coconut oil. It's important to me that it's organic, but it also smells so wonderful that we're tempted to just eat it. It is pure and combines beautifully with the beeswax.",5
"I think this is a great product. I use it for a variety of things including cooking, making home made skin care products, hair care, etc. I will buy again.",4
"I have used coconut oil for several years since moving to the mountains (very, very dry air).  This is my first use for Viva labs, and I will stay with them.  In the winter, I use this at night after a shower/bath.  Yes, it is in a solid form (especially in Colorado winters), but just a few seconds will warm it up to almost liquid.  I usually put the jar in front of a small heater that I use for the bathroom, and that's enough to soften it.  It is a bit greasy, but that's why I use it.  Makes my skin much softer than any other product I've ever purchased.",5
"I bought this brand after using another brand for a very long time. Unfortunately the other brand decided to raise their prices significantly here on Amazon, so I switched over to the Viva labs organic extra-virgin coconut oil and I am very happy with it. The taste and consistency is very good so I definitely recommend this product",5
Received this coconut oil and instantly started using it. There are so many uses for coconut oil! I'm using it as a supplement and for my skin and it's worked wonders in just a few days! Very happy :),5
"I have used this to replace butter, olive oil, and spray.  I use it in food prep,  It's really great!",4
"I have very dry skin, when I started using this, I was skeptical.  Now, I use it on my face, I dot a little more under my eyes, and on my lips.  I really smear it thick on my throat and neck, and the rest of my body.  My skin looks so glowy, and I am seeing less of those noticeable wrinkles.  I have not used in on my hair, yet, I will though.  I have not cooked with it yet, I plan to.  I love putting it on at night before bedtime, I smell like the beach!  You have to try this, give it a chance.  Yes, when you first put it on, it feels a bit sticky, but, that goes away in a few minutes.  I will never run out of this stuff!",5
"I've never used coconut oil before so this being my first one, I'd have to say it's great.  The texture and smell are both pleasing.",5
"When I opened the jar of this coconut oil, I was so enraptured by the scent, I shared the experience with a few friends, then closed it and put it away. I continued to waste my Nutiva coconut oil on ordinary cooking and baking, with the intent to use this exquisite oil for coconut deserts. Since coconut oil has antibacterial properties, I also plan to use it for homemade personal care products, as soon as I use up what I already have on hand.The aroma is truly heavenly: much better than the best coconut I have ever had fresh from a grocery store, or from any metal, glass, aseptic or refrigerated container in the form of coconut water, milk or oil.I received a free sample of this coconut oil from the company with the request to leave a review here, but no requirement to do so.",5
"I am in the process of trying to remove as many harmful chemicals from my lifestyle as possible. I have only purchased one other brand of coconut oil before (Spectrum). Mainly at that point I was just using it for cooking with so that was fine. But this is cold-pressed and unrefined as well as organic. I could smell the difference when I opened the jar. It smells fantastic and it is super soft.I use it to make toothpaste with, to moisturize skin all over, for oil pulling in the morning, and it makes a fantastic makeup remover at night. After a week of using it both as a makeup remover and as a base under my makeup in the morning (it works well enough with the powder and it's balanced out my complexion so I don't even have to use the foundation if I don't want to), my skin looks great.I have sensitive skin and have to be careful what I put on it so it is a real relief to find something natural that makes my skin look so even and all the little breakouts and ingrown hair problems have smoothed out. I could scream with I think of how much time and money I have spent on things to keep my skin from being uneven and clear and it turns out all those things were just making it worse.I love it so it's fine for me but If you don't like coconut you should be aware that it does smell very ""coconutty.""I plan on trying to make homemade shampoo and shaving cream too in which this will be an ingredient. I will try to remember to come back and update my post when I have done so and let everyone know how it turned out. Can be used to make bar soap but that's a project I'm not going to attempt for a while yet.Also on a final note, this is really good for cooking with, but it would likely not do well at high heat, it says on the label that it does okay up to something like 325 or 350 degrees. I don't ever fry anything so it isn't a problem for me but it's something to consider if your cooking.",5
"I would highly recommend this coconut oil- great for all uses, and good value for the price-  would by more in the future.",5
Great stuff. Great price. Can use it for everything! My 17 month old loves it. Eats it of out the jar. Works great on his eczema and diaper rash. Use it for cooking as well.,5
"I don't know too much about coconut oil. This is my first time purchasing coconut oil. It is in solid form so you will have to heat it up to make ""liquid.""  No compliants yet.",4
"I ordered this product because I have tried a number of coconut oil brands for cooking, hair, facial, etc., and this seemed like a good product. Well, it is better than good, it is excellent. The first day after it arrived, I put a spoonful in my morning smoothie, I lathered it on my face for shaving, and I applied it as a moisturizer after shaving. I use another coconut oil product as a conditioner in my hair after shampooing, but as soon as that's gone, I will begin using Viva Labs Coconut Oil. That's how much I like it!",5
"I was looking for Coconut Oil to use for my hair.  I read all kinds descriptions and decided on Viva Labs for several reasons; mainly because it is organic and seems to have gotten good reviews from people who had used other brands.  It is light.  Though solid it melts quickly in your hand.  It was easy to massage it into my scalp; no dripping or clumping.  It didn't leave oil marks on pillowcases or chairs so it stayed where I wanted it to.  And it was easy to wash right out (I use Wen cleansing conditioner-so without a detergent or a harsh stripping shampoo). The results were magnificent! My scalp feels healthier, less dry and my hair has bounce from the roots.  There was no hair loss in the comb after cleansing my hair-which was the main reason I purchased the Coconut Oil.  So, great product , easy order and fast delivery!  Thanks!",5
"I am, so far, really enjoying this Coconut Oil. As soon as I opened the jar, the smell alone was heavenly! I am currently using this oil as a hand moisturizer; it is light and, as I mentioned, smells absolutely amazing!Full disclusure: the company contacted me and asked that I write a review and said that if I did, they would donate $10 to Vitamin Angels, a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing child mortality worldwide by connecting infants and children with essential nutrients through vitamin supplementation.",5
"SOO good for ur skin.. and so good for YOU~ we put a tablespoon in our nutribullet along with maca root, spinage and whatever else we're in the mood for! I RECOMMEND this to ANYONE esp good for ur hair and skin!!!",5
Tastes good and is a great oil/butter substitute. The health benefits from using it are an extreme plus. 100% natural and organic. Mmm!,5
I love this product!  I have been looking for a natural moisturizer for a long time and this does an incredible job.  There is no greasy feel and makes my skin feel soft and comfortable.  I was fearful it might make my face break out...thankfully not the case.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great natural skin product.  It smells great too!,5
"This particular kind of coconut oil is wonderful. Smells good and has man, many health benefits! I like to brush my teeth with a tiny bit of this mixed with baking soda. Its a wonderful moisturizer and is great for cooking with.",5
Love this!  We've been making smoothies with it.  Tastes yummy and I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family!,5
"Overall, I was looking for a Coconut Oil that wasn't overtly ""coconut flavored"". Just something subtle to cook with, and add to meals/smoothies. This hits the nail on the head, in my opinion; will definitely be ordering more!",5
"great product at a good price- you won't be disappointed, you need to try it trust me on that :) !!!",5
GREAT PRODUCT EASY TO USE. TASTES GOOD A MUST FOR A HEALTHY LIFE. DOES NOT CHANGE THE TASTE OF FOOD,5
"Great product no matter what you choose to use it for; Hair, Skin, Cooking or just eating it plain! Its awesome! I love the light scent and flavor as well. I suggest buying 2 jars if you plan to use it for both food and body care, you don't want to be eating out of the same jar you dip your fingers in lol If you're just now trying coconut oil and don't know much about its health benefits or uses, I recommend Google. There is a link, ""101 Uses for Coconut Oil"" from Wellness Mama. Check it out! Oh and my baby LOVES his coconut oil massages :)",5
"Bought This Product For My Hair & I Absolutely LOVE It. It Smells Great, It Makes My Hair Feel Thick & Full, And My Hair Is Growing Faster Than Usual.",5
"I mainly purchased the coconut oil for hair care. I mixed it with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil for a hair moisturizer, as I have dry hair. Also used the coconut oil for a hot oil treatment with Tea Tree Oil and warming them on the stove in a sauce pan.I tried using this for cooking and found it to be almost as good as using margarine or butter, with a slight difference in taste.Overall I do like Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.",5
"So was I.  Been reading about its health benefits and wanted to give it a try.  Did a little research into products on the market and decided to go with Viva Labs as the first test.I was not disappointed.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the product when I finally got to open it up.  I wasn't sure what I was prepared for but when I opened the jar I was met with the fresh scent of coconut and a wonderfully tasting product that works great for cooking.  I am immediately sold and will be repeat customer with them.If you're new to coconut oil and only want to buy a small jar as your first test, I would go with Viva Labs.  I think you'll also be sold.",5
"I bought this because of all the wonderful things that I have read about coconut oil. I read that the solid is so much better than any other form. I took a tablespoon and dissolved it in my mouth thinking it would taste awful. Surprisingly it was good.have only just received it , so can't comment on how it works.",4
"Love this product!!! I have VERY dry sensitive skin. I've tried other products but was allergic to the perfume used to scent them or they were so heavy they didn't absorb into my skin. Coconut oil smells great, isn't greasy and is so soothing! Gonna buy more to use in the kitchen!",5
"Cocunut has lots uses, in cookin,for cosmetic purposes..great product to have around,plus lasts a long time,I don't mind writing a review but the require y write a book",4
I bought to use as a face cleanser/moisturizer to replace expensive beauty products and it has certainly met my expectations!,5
Wonderful service--arrived on time.  What a wonderful taste!  It even smells good when you open the container.  I haven't been using it long enough to see any results yet.  I recommended it to a friend who is already using coconut oil she purchased from a large chain store.  She said hers does not have the good taste or smell this one has.  She plans to get Viva in the future.,5
I love coconut smell! This is so good for my  hair and body smooth and hydrate.Will definitely Purchase this again!,5
I love the smell. This is great for the skin. I love that it has such a strong coconut smell.,5
"I'm a tropical citizen studying in the USA and I longed for something that was close enough to the real thing I could get so easily at home. This seemed to fit that criteria. This oil smelled GREAT, and was an excellent moisturiser for my hair and skin. That coupled with quick delivery gives this a five star rating imho.",5
"Its very good, and tastes yummy as a supplement, though an odd texture to get used to at first.Go ahead and buy it. :)",5
"great product and amazing price, and it's good for all type of skins and hair ,and it's also  great for cooking.",5
"Great taste...take a spoonful a day for health. also put on dry skin, or even put in hair if it is dry...love it.",5
"After seeing and tasting coconut oil at my daughter-in-laws home, I decided to try it for myself.  I picked Viva Labs because it seemed like a handy size for starters.  I read about the oils and was prepared to be a bit choosy!  My package arrived promptly and in fine condition.  The oil itself was pristine and white and had a healthy aroma.  I am very pleased with the price and quality and will be ordering it again.  Thank you!",5
Smells good and is organic.  I use it on my hair and skin. It fully absorbs and is non greasy.,5
I purchased this to use for my dogs. I give them a small amount in their food to help their coats and for general health. I also use it as a coditioner for my show dog. Her coat looks amazing! I am a groomer and have recommened this to clients dogs have skin issues. Some have seen good results as little as a few weeks.Now I use it every day for a neck and hand cream. Just a matter of time I'll use it to cook with. I love the way it melts with just the warmth of your hands. Great price too!,5
"I was buying a specific brand of coconut oil, but the price was much higher.  I found Viva Labs coconut oil for a lower price and decided to try it.  I am very satisfied with this product.  It has a great flavor and is just as good as the more expensive coconut oil I've purchased in the past.  I would definitely recommend this product to others!",5
I have only been using it for a very short time but I am already loving what it is doing for my skin. I have only cooked with it once and it was only to 'grease' a pan so I don't really have any comments on that yet.,5
"I normally buy a really big jar of organic EVCO for every day use, especially cooking and baking and as a supplement for my dogs, but every brand I've tried has lumps that you can't get out, even if you warm it and whip it first, so while it's good for some things it can be difficult for others - it sometimes makes my food lumpy (like in frosting) and leaves clumps on my hair and face if I use it as a beauty product.However, this EVCO is smooth and goes on without any lumps, which makes me very happy, because finally I can use coconut oil more easily as a beauty product (the lumps would get stuck in my hair, fall off all over the house and just make a mess, which my dogs would usually eat, but that doesn't help me)!  When I tease my hair enormously (which I often do), I just brush some of this oil through my hair to get out the mats, let it soak overnight and wash it in the morning, and it's like nothing happened!  I also get very dry skin in the winter, so what I do now is rub an aloe-based lotion on, then do a top coat of EVCO to seal it in - sometimes I even put on gloves or socks and sleep with them on to allow even more absorption!  This is also what I use to gently remove heavy, caked-on stage makeup, especially around my eyes.  No chemicals, nothing harsh, and it moisturizes as it cleans!  I usually follow up with a toner on my t-zone, then put one last thin layer of oil on my face.  My skin stays very well balanced.I also have a dog with very dry skin, and EVCO is one of the few things I feel safe putting on her as a topical aid, because she licks everything off (she gets plenty supplements and her diet is optimized for skin and coat conditioning - no processed foods, whole sources of protein, etc., and she actually eats coconut oil as well, for those of you who will inevitably comment on what I might be doing wrong to make her skin so dry).I love EVCO and use it for everything, so I've been really happy with this particular consistency.  I want to get another one for baking.  I get the feeling I'll have much smoother vegan frosting with this oil!",5
"The fresh cocoanut flavor,is great.Love the bottle shape easier access for removing .Would be interested in larger quantity .",5
Really like it.  Overall quality product.  It really brings out the taste of my food.  Also works well with popcorn.,5
This is a wonderful product I have used coconut oil in the past its awesome to cook with the food taste great I cannot say enough about it this product I would recommend it to everyone to try this is why I gave a 5 star review.,5
"I have used other coconut oils and this is first time to try this particular brand. However, this particular one seems so hard I can hardly get it out of the jar, and this is at room temperature, so I'm getting a spoonful of ""flakes."" I chose this brand because it's organic and processed in the Philippines. Otherwise, taste if good.",3
I was reluctant to use coconut oil in general but after reading lots of reviews decided to give it a try and am very glad I did. Its very light with foods and has a wonderful taste. I used it with cakes and even for frying eggs. I think I have officially made the permanent switch to coconut oil for my cooking.,5
"I haven't used much of this yet, but plan to use it for making baby wipes.  I've also heard it's good for diaper rash.  I've only just opened the tub, but it smells really nice (not too coconut-ty), and felt great on my skin.  Absorbed easily.  I need to use it some more, which is why I only gave it 4 stars for now.",4
Excellent product. Feels and smells wonderful on your skin. Many other uses as well. Highly recommend. Better than many high priced cremes.,5
"I am in love with coconut oil as a multipurpose product, I am trying to use more natural/whole products and this is perfect. It smells fantastic, it makes my hair so soft when used as a mask and my skin as well since I've started using it in replacement of lotion, sometimes mixing with sweet almond oil. I also eat it, i use it in replacement of butter or oil when making eggs and I've used it while making my own granola, I'm excited to find more recipes for it. There are a lot of health benefits with consuming coconut oil, you really can not go wrong with this product it is excellent.",5
I'm very excited to try all the different ways to use coconut oil. I put a spoonful in my coffee and also dip into it as a dessert. It's so delicious it is almost addicting. Thank you for making a great tasting organic product.,4
"Tastes great, makes me feel fine, all's good! I switched from veg oil to coconut oil a few months ago and won't go back to veg. This oil just cooks cleaner and leaves you feeling healthier. Using more actually feels BETTER.",5
"I liked this product a lot - bought it because I made the mistake of thinking I could just buy coconut oil at the supermarket - the stale smelling, tasteless carp that I got sent me running to Amazon.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I'm kinda torn if I liked this one better than a previous brand I bought on Amazon - a genuine toss-up.  But I strongly recommend this.",4
"I give this product 5 stars because I have purchased SEVERAL brands of coconut oil - looking for something that I didn't have to dig out with a jack-hammer!  THIS OIL doesn't cause me that grief!  It's solid, but it reacts to the temperature of my hand so quickly that I can feel my 98 degrees melting it!  My daughter has severe dry skin and this is her new lotion... I have dry hair and I use a tiny bit on the ends and it works wonders all day long!  I had NO idea I would be so pleased with this product!  And it smells wonderful.... like coconut (obviously) but the smell doesn't linger for forever or smell ""old"" after some time.  I can't see us being without this!  Thank you, VIVA LABS!!!  You've solved a problem for us!",5
"This is the first time I've tried Coconut Oil. I use it for cooking, as lotion, deodarant and much more. Just as expected!",5
"I love this coconut oil! I use it for everything - hair mask, after shower moisturizer, sexual lubricant, and more. Additionally, this brand seems to have a more fine texture than others I've tried, and did not arrive looking as thought it had melted and hardened a dozen times. Highly recommended!",5
This is my first time using this coconut oil and I love it! My face is starting to clear out!,5
"I am very pleased with this product.  Because I live in a small town that does not have a store that has this product, I am very, very pleased that I can order a quality product like this coconut oil and have it delivered to my door.",5
"Its creamy, smooth with an awesome coconut smell! I use this on my skin as part of my OCM routine every morning!",5
"I started using coconut oil a couple of years ago as a supplement to the diet of dogs that come into rescue.  As an addition to the diet, it helps tremendously with skin and coat issues, and also seems to help ease gi stress that is common in dogs whose diet has generally been poor and who are transitioned to a high quality food.  It also is great for topical issues, and several people report success with using it to treat topical fungal issues and other skin conditions.For humans, its a good product for dry skin, especially dry scalp, and is great for cooking too.I originally ordered another product and switched to this one when the price of the other increased dramatically.  This is a good quality coconut oil at a fair price.  Thanks Viva Labs!",5
I've tried a number of coconut oils and this product would stack up with the best of them. I found this coconut oil to have a crisp but clear coconut flavor but not overpowering. I also found the texture to be on the dry side (crisp) which in my opinion is beneficial. Temperature will greatly affect the texture the matter what coconut oil you use.,5
"I like the idea of using Coconut Oil.  It's versatile and healthy.Some Coconut Oils go bad quickly and some have an over-dominating flavor of Coconut.The Viva Labs is so far our favorite.  It has a slight coconut flavor when the food you are cooking it with has no other seasoning.  This very slight flavor is very nice, but if I don't want it to mix with other flavors I am working with, it is very easy to mask with other seasoning.",5
"This is my 1st time trying this specific coconut oil but I'm loving it so far!  I have been using it for a variety of things- as a body moisturizer, cooking oil, etc.  It feels & tastes great!",5
"I love the coconut oil......you can eat it right out of the jar,put it in a smoothie drink it in your coffee (yum!). It's also a very nice moisturizer. I haven't done this yet but you can cook with it too! It's totally awesome.",5
"A friend recommended this product for dry skin. Works great! Not oily and smells really nice. Haven't tried it for cooking yet, but will in the future.",5
"I've been using coconut oil for awhile as a replacement for other oils when cooking. I ordered Viva because I found it on sale on Amazon and am extremely happy with the product! The smell of the oil is fantastic - adds an extra element to any dishes I make. I use it as a replacement for butter in baking as well, with delicious results.I also use it as a lotion, as is, for arms and legs. I have pretty sensitive skin, and if used on my chest I tend to break out. But for the rest of the body (minus the face) it is a great hydrator, especially during the winter. Some people use this on their face with great success, but I can't. Oh well. Not the oil's fault!",5
"It was everything I hoped it would be! I will be using it for variety of things, by itself and to make face scrub.",5
"works great on my face and hair, it's extra dry. this helps me look great with my thick hair which is sometimes hard to do.",5
"I wanted an organic, extra virgin coconut oil to use in making a face and hand lotion at home.  And this product is exactly what I needed.  I've already made two batches and they both turned out great.",5
"When I 1st opened it I was surprised it was so solid in formation. I stuck my fingers right in the jar, pulled out a clump, and rubbed my hands together to warm it up. It's consistency by then is just like an oil I poured from a bottle. I applied it to my skin & it was nowhere near as greasy as I thought it would be. I have really dry, irritated skin due to skin & food allergies & it felt very soothing! Usually after applying lotion or oil in the morning on my legs, I'm usually itchy & dry by the evening. This coconut oil lasts all day! Love it",5
"Purchased this product to use for moisturizing scalp because of persistent flaking.  Use a spoon to place a small scoop of semi-solid in your palm.  It melts and applies easily for application to hair / scalp / face overnight (use a hand towel on your pillow).  Seems to put a good luster in your hair.  But has not corrected scalp flaking - which is perhaps expecting too much of this product.  Pleasant, nice coconut aroma that does not overpower and fades quickly.  But does not substitute for dermatological ointments.",4
My daughter only cooks with coconut oil and it can be expensive. This product is more reasonable than the more popular brand we had previously been ordering. My daughter says it is creamier and is happy with the oil for her cooking. I am happy with the price.,5
I have enjoyed using this for beauty care. I have not used this to cook yet but it smells and tastes great!,5
"This is great coconut oil!  It's organic and non-gmo certified.  I love the container it comes in, makes it much easier to access when you get to the bottom than regular glass jars.",5
"Seriously, this smells like actual coconut.  And it does in one night what the ""coconut oil"" we bought at Walmart sort of does after a few days.  It gets rid of that diaper rash and doesn't break down the liners of our cloth diapers.So smooth.  Winner winner.",5
"I love coconut oil for everything from my face to sauteing fish.  Also, an excellent hand cream.....just do not use too much of it.",5
"Fairly priced, organic coconut oil. I use it as a makeup remover on a cotton pad that is a little moistened with water, and then as a body moisturizer as well. I also put it on my lips! While I'm touting it's benefits for skin, I'll share that it's also a wonderful, natural lubricant. Yep. Google it. Works great.",5
My purchased arrived very fast and it works great to moisturize my hair. Smells really good and makes my hair soft and doesn't weigh it down.,4
"I recently read up on the many benefits of coconut oil and decided to select Viva Labs as my supplier. Coconut oil is great stuff, especially in this current super winter of January 2014. It's great for skin, hair and many more uses. Viva Labs was prompt with their delivery and sent a nice thank you note. I don't know when I'll run out (it's a HUGE jar for a great price) but I'll contact Viva Labs again when I do.",5
It is pure and organic. I love how it make my skin feel. I mix it up with some shea butter and use it an body lotion.,5
"It smells wonderful, a little goes a long way. I purchased to begin ""oil pulling"" and am pleased with the taste. Also works great on my hair and makes it smell great.",5
"Viva Labs Organic EV Coconut Oil has been a delightful product to use thus far. It's texture is almost creamy, the smell is mild as well as the taste, and the overall quality of the product is excellent.However I do not use this product for cooking (although I'm sure it would be perfectly fine in a pinch, I have another favorite i use for cooking). I use this product for skin care- on it's own and in a luxurious mixture of other oils and natural butters, and it mixes very well with other products,I use it for hair care as well and it leaves my hair looking shiny and feeling soft and since coconut oil is hydrophobic it also helps keep my thick hair from turning frizzy in the humid weather.Overall I give this product a 4 out of 5 because it is a good quality product and the price is right.",4
Very fast shipping. Smooth transaction!  Love this coconut oil!! I use it on my skin snd hair!  Also mix with sugar to make a skin exfoliate!,5
"I must admit that I had not previously used coconut oil but, believe me, I am impressed with this product.  It smells heavenly and provides a delicious flavor to whatever I am cooking.  It rates high above other non-coconut oils I have used.  Also, it is a great skin product that makes my skin feel great, and over time, seems to be giving me more and more improvement.  I waited quite a while before reviewing this product as I wanted to use it for a proper testing time. It passed with flying colors.  I highly recommend it....no reservations!",5
"I use coconut oil literally daily. I use it in my coffee, on my skin, in cooking, and in my baby's cloth wipes solution (coconut oil is cloth diaper safe). The oil is smooth and buttery and has a wonderful aroma. It's as good as other organic coconut oils I've purchased in the past, and I'll be happy to purchase Viva Labs' coconut oil when I run out. Don't hesitate on this one.I received this jar of coconut oil as a sample, but my opinion is unbiased.",5
"Received as expected and in great condition. We use it for frying , baking, and skin care ! You can't go wrong!",4
"My family uses coconut oil on a daily basis for cooking, baking, beauty needs, and we even sprinkle some on the dog's food to make her Silky Terrier coat look better!We found the Viva Labs product to be of good quality from a taste and smell point.  This does have a light coconut scent, which I know some people don't care for, but I found it pleasant.  I use it daily to cook scrambled eggs, and I much prefer the coconut smell compared to melted better.  The facts about it being USDA certified organic and non-GMO are a big plus for my wife who really looks for this in the products we use.I knocked off a star for two reasons.  One, the oil was in a solid form, and I noticed a slight yellowish color once we got to the bottom of the jar.  Im not sure how to explain the slight discoloration.  Given the time of the year, the oil didnt go through liquid/solid forms from cooling down and warming up.  I guess it is possible some other food substance fell in (e.g., crumbs from a piece of bread).  All I know is Ive not seen this before on other coconut oils Ive used, but it didn't impact the taste or smell.  The second reason for reducing one star on the review is the limited size options.  The only option is 15 ounces, but we normally purchase this in bulk to save money.  It does look like the company is planning 32 ounce and 54 ounce containers, but they arent available as of the writing of this review.Overall, I had a good experience with the product and would recommend it to others.DISCLOSUREViva Labs sent me a complementary container for review. I don't have a relationship with the company, and the free sample didn't influence my review.",4
"I purchased this product looking for an alternative to my normal beauty routine, specifically in place of a make up remover or cold cream, both of which I have become sensitive to recently. After reading many reviews dubbing coconut oil as the wonder product of the bathroom and kitchen, I decided to give it a try figuring that, at worst, I could cook with it.When this plastic container arrived, I was quite pleased with the size considering what I paid. As others have noted, the product is solid, but quickly becomes oily with the heat from your touch; it also has a nice light coconut fragrance. To make the large tub easier to work with in the bathroom, I spooned several scoops into a separate air tight container and left the larger container in the pantry for kitchen use.After a couple weeks of use I've concluded that this product is not for my face. It doesn't provide enough moisture and has proven to be quite comedogenic leaving dry, flaky, uneven skin. I have used it as bath oil and found that it left my skin feeling great without any adverse effects (granted I've only tried this once).My hair, however, loves the stuff. Applying it to wet hair immediately after a shower leaves my natural curls smooth and frizz free. I also apply a little to dry hair before using heat, such as hot rollers, and find that curls made this way stay for much longer usual and are so glossy, it's amazing!Note: I have very, very thick hair and use this product only on the ends of my hair (avoiding the scalp). I would not recommend this for thin fine hair as it might make hair look greasy/stringy.I'm still giving this product five stars on the grounds that I feel it is a quality product that smells great, tastes wonderful, and does wonders for my hair. That said, I will continue to search for a product that my very sensitive skin loves too.",5
"I have been a long time user of coconut oil for both cooking and beauty purposes. Prior to trying the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, I used two different brands. One, a cheaper variety for beauty needs, and another brand of higher caliber for cooking.  The Viva Labs blows them both away and I don't think I'll ever be able to use anything else again.Aside from being pure and organic, this is the first coconut oil that I've used that tasted like coconuts.  In a way, this has taken some getting used to as I'm not used to the flavor permeating into all of my meals.  In another way, it makes me wonder what was going on with the brands that I used before.Taste, sight, smell, even texture, there is a startling difference between this coconut oil and anything that I've used in the past. The Viva Labs brand will now be my go-to for all purposes.  Although the first can I received was gratis, I will be purchasing this in the future.",5
"I bought this product for the beauty properties of it.I used this as a deep conditioning mask and it left my hair quite soft and shiny, there is a definite difference from before and after the treatment.Smells amazing too!",4
"I've tried multiple jars of coconut oil that I use for moisturizer.  This one is incredibly smooth and great quality.  Super happy, especially that it's a larger size for a good price.",5
"I like this product and use in my morning coffee or tea. It tastes great and blends easily. I give it 4 stars because it would be great if the container were glass instead of plastic. It would make their product even taste and smell better. Encourage Viva Labs to change to a glass container, then they would get 5 stars :)",4
Goes on smooth and absorbs nicely.  Smells great going on and very subtle thereafter.  There is something comforting about moisturizing with a product so wholesome that it is billed as both a beauty care and a food product!,5
Smells good and can be used for cooking and on skin and/or hair. Comes with instructions on how to use as well!,4
"I just received this and I love it!!!!  I have used it on my skin so far and it is amazing.  Am looking forward to cooking with it as well.  Thank you so much for a great product.Happy New Year,Pamela",5
"The container is easy to open, even with slippery hands, which I've found to be surprisingly important.  I've gotten coconut oil elsewhere in a glass jar with metal lid and sometimes it's nearly impossible to get open.Besides that the quality seems on par with other coconut oil I've gotten and it's the best value I found on Amazon.  When it's time to get more, I'll be looking for the same stuff from Viva Labs.",5
I've been dealing with very dry hair for a months now after speaking to my doctor he recommended coconut oil to help.After weeks of using the product I've seen changes in which has converted me.I do suggest not to add too much it'll make your hair too oily and the build-up can drag your hair down causing you to wash your hair too often.,5
"My husband and I both have a horrible problem with our skin.  It seems that the least little scrape causes large red, bruiselike damage.  It takes weeks to go away or if irritated again, will sometimes last over a month.This Coconut Oil when applied daily removes the horrendous marks in just a few days.  It is amazing.",5
"I just finished my first jar of this oil and I cant say enough good things about it. I was given a free jar of this coconut oil from Viva Labs to see if I would like the product and I can honestly say I did. As soon as I open the jar I smelled the sweet scent of this oil and it was a delight. I immediately started adding it to my fruit and vegetable smoothies and noticed it adds a very nice nutty flavor to it. My favorite was when mixed in with bananas and pineapple. I honestly never though of adding coconut oil to my smoothies until I got this product, but now I am making it part of my diet. Not only for the nice taste and flavor I get but also for all the great health benefits that come from coconut oil, which you can read about any where on the web or in natural health books. Do not hesitate to make this super food part of your diet. I would highly recommend it.",5
I had originally bought this for cooking for Paleo recipes and found that i liked it much better for my skin and hair. Upon arriving I read that it was extremely good for dry skin and dry hair both of which i commonly have. So I first applied it to my feet and was quite surprised at how wonderful it smelled and fast it worked. Than I followed the instructions and applied it to my hair for 2 hours than showered afterwards. My hair was silky smooth! This was an excellent buy for the reasons I now use it for. Maybe i'll cook with it lol,5
"It is a good quality coconut oil, but the plastic packaging should be glass, and to me the taste isn't the greatest.",3
"I admit I haven't used this in anything cooking, but it's my new favorite moisturizer for my skin, especially now in the winter. Though it does take awhile to soak in fully without leaving oil marks on things, it softens and nourishes and has a really great effect on skin. It also worked wonders on my feet, especially on the rough heel and elbow. I've also used it on my fingers, to help soften my cuticles and prevent hangnails. Though I'm mostly just super prone to hangnails, and still get them, I've still noticed a difference.Even better, though, is being able to use it in my hair - which is thick and curly and rather unruly and frizzy. It took me a good while to figure out how much to use - it is super easy to use too much - but it tames it, helps with the frizz, and also makes the curls tighter rather than going all over the place. With how thick my hair is, it did take more than what's usually suggested in online articles, and since my hair is naturally kind of oily, that complicated it for me. But with patience, I found the right amount and now it's even easier to just rub some in after my shower and go, letting it dry naturally. I did have some problem with it building up, but a clarifying shampoo helped take care of that quick. Be sure to also take care with your pillow cases if using it in your hair, especially during the learning the right amount stage.Other things I've used it with is as a natural lip balm, especially over night, to keep my lips from chapping. I've tried it one my face as a moisturizer too and while it worked, it was a little too oily for my skin type, and I admit, having the constant coconut smell right at my nose was too much for me. This is a great product, with so many uses!",5
Love this coconut oil because it's organic. Also love that it's in a jar I can actually fit my hand it. I use this as a pre poo for my naturally curly hair and also as a sealant.,5
i enjoy cooking with this oil and  it is just enough that it is never over powering with my recepies.,4
"Product shipped very quickly and I am very pleased with the quality. I have only been using it for a couple of day, but seems to be perfect for oil pulling an moisturizing as I had intended to use it.",4
I had been reading the praises of cooking with coconut oil or just using it as a butter substitute on toast.  This oil is excellent with a slight hint of coconut taste.  I love it both for cooking and on toast and will definitely be back for more.,5
"I loved it but it is the Price which made me this time order another Brand. Would it be less expensive ? if I order next time, after I used the new one that I ordered 2 days ago from a different Company.",5
Great taste.  I love to toss it into my steamed garlicky broccoli.  I also use it as a facial moisturizer and great for detangling my natural tightly coiley textured hair.  Shipment came as stated on my order.LMR - Georgia,5
"I love Viva Labs Extra Virgin Coconut Oil! It smells and tastes delicious, and it has so many fantastic uses. I even feed it to my cat to prevent urinary tract infections and protect against other bad bacterias and parasites. It's also fantastic for homemade popcorn. There are millions of uses for it, just google it and you will see. Viva Labs product is superior, affordable, and I love it!",5
This coconut oil is super. It smells fantastic and adds just the right flavor to foods. I am most pleased with this product.,5
"Although the label reads that this product is ""excellent for cooking"" and used ""as a restorative"" for hair, I have used it exclusively to help keep my rather dry facial skin well moisturized.  There are days when all the best of department store moisturizers, olive oil, Vitamin C preparations, etc. do not do the trick as well as this coconut oil. I remembered using it once and overhearing the great Dr Oz himself state that coconut oil was EXCELLENT for skin care. Then one day I even heard Kirstie Alley state that her secret of skin care was using coconut oil. Now I see why. Upon opening the jar you are reminded of some hardened kind of vaseline jelly. Then you put it on your face and it just melts!  If feels SO GOOD. I use it in the morning, before going to bed or whenever my skin is feeling kind of dry (more often in the winter) and I really do feel restored. I have been thinking about trying it on my hair as well. I can honestly recommend this product because it is so natural and even better, it works!",5
"First of all, this smells amazing. If you love the coconut scent, you will love this. Personally, I use this as a deep conditioning treatment for my hair. Whatever your use may be, I recommend this product.",5
"Exactly as described. Has a fresh, coconut scent. Great on popcorn, or used as a skin moisturizer. Good for my guinea pig's dry skin as well as my own.",5
This stuff is fantastic.  I use it in my morning smoothie everyday and to cook fish in the pan.  Delicious and Nutritious!,5
"I received a complimentary tub of this coconut oil to review and it definitely tastes and smells like coconut. We cook with it, use it on skin, for oil pulling (swishing around the mouth to reduce harmful bacteria) and even use it make home made toothpaste. It works for us. In cooler temperatures (72 F) it does remain hard, but all coconut oil I have ever used does this as well.I did read the four answered questions here on Amazon and it appears there are some questions about labeling so if you're concerned about the validity of the non GMO and organic claims on the container you may want to check the questions as well.",4
"The incredible edible coconut oil! And it's organic! Will certainly be purchasing more of this product in the future.(I only say the future because the size of the first one is huge!) Put it on your skin, in your hair, in your frying pan or anywhere else that may come to mind. No matter where you put it, it will exceed your expectations!",5
Great coconut oil for a decent price. Comes in a pretty big jar. I am completely satisfied. Would definitely reorder,5
"I use this primarily for skin care after shaving. Works really well and smells like coconut(obviously). Provides really great results - I end up with nice silky skin. Works well for the hair also. Have yet to use it in cooking, but I do intend to do so.",5
I like this product very much - very light & tasty.I would recommend this product to anyone seeking a healthier cooking oil alternative.,4
"A natural hair conditioner and a nice protective coating for the skin.  (and you can eat it too!)The oil is semi-solid at room temperature, and it's easy to scoop some out with your fingers (no warming or softening needed). It almost immediately turns to liquid on contact. In the container, the oil has a very distinct scent of coconuts, reminding me of macaroons or coconut-cream pie.  Once applied to skin or hair, the scent fades quickly.My GF really likes the oil as a conditioner, saying it leaves her hair silky and completely de-tangled.  She found it applies easily and not-messily. She applies it an hour before washing her hair (and commented that while it feels oily sitting on her hair during that hour, it's not ""bad oily"").  It washes out easily, usually one wash is enough. The conditioning effects seemed to last 2-3 days. The GF was very impressed.I also tried the oil on my skin.  It forms a protective layer (like a natural vaseline) rather than soaking-in and drying like a lotion.  That effect helps keep the skin from drying out, but isn't sufficient to re-moisturize dry skin here during the mid-atlantic winter. As the directions suggest, that makes it a better choice for elbows, feet, and other areas that just need some extra protection during dry months.Although I haven't tried this yet, since the oil doesn't dry up, but isn't greasy, it may be perfect for a lightweight massage oil.  Something to try next time the GF gives me a shoulder massage!I had been seeing a lot of buzz recently around coconut-oil products, and was pleased to have a chance to try this organic brand. It's a little funny to have a haircare product that's a reasonable skincare product that also, based on reading others' reviews, has many uses in the kitchen. Quite a versatile product![ I was given this product to review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion. ]The best part is, unlike many big-brand health & beauty products, this product is not laden with mysterious or noxious chemicals-- just coconut oil.  I especially appreciate this after I spent several hours yesterday with EWG's SkinDeep database in an unrelated search for replacement personal care products that were both carried by Amazon and reasonably non-toxic (and still in my price-range).  Using a natural product avoids that whole song and dance.Recommended.",5
We had read other people's recommendations for using coconut oil instead of K-Y Liquid. One nice thing is that it is edible. We found that it is nice and slippery with very few problems. Normal human body heat makes it melt enough to be perfect as a lubricant. I will NOT be going back to K-Y or (even worse) Astro-Glide.,5
"Coconut oil has so many health benefits and it is so easy to use.  Use it in it's solid, room temperature state to substitute for butter or warm in slightly in the microwave just to liquefaction and use like you would any other oil.  I love it in all my cooking.  It is great for popcorn because it gives it just the smallest hint of flavor.  Just an incredible product.",5
I love the rich texture of this oil and the scent is heavenly! I used this in a diy moisturizer and have been very pleased with the results.,5
Size and style of container leads to ease of use.  Consistency and flavor of the coconut oil are both excellent.,5
"Wherever it's applied, it makes the skin super soft.  I would highly recommend this product.  At first I wasn't too keen on ""coconut"" scent; however, it's not over-the-top, so it worked for me and I'm sure it will work for you.",4
"Full Disclosure: I was contacted by Viva Labs and given a free sample of this product and asked to give an unbiased and honest review, I was not compensated financially for the review.This is a great product, delicious, well packaged, and at a good price point.  I would happily use the product again.",5
I use this Coconut Oil daily and this Viva Labs is great.  Plus it was at my door just a couple days after I ordered.,5
"Bought this on recommendation from other reviewers for my son's cradle cap/dry scalp. I thought it would be pretty good, the stuff looked and smelled nice. But wow! It worked on one application. And this is a huge tub - great value for the $$. Smelled good, tasted amazing. I am now looking for other ways to use it. Even gave my daughter a hair mask - reduced her frizzies and gave her a deep conditioning. Go ahead, buy it if you're not sure. It's terrific!",5
There are many health reasons to use this wonderful product.  It is great for your skin and hair as well as for using for cooking.,5
"Smells great, easy to use, I have healthier hair. I will be buying more! My mom has really bad hair and it works wonders for her.",5
"While I know this can be used in cooking, my jar never left the bathroom  I've used this product as a replacement for my hand cream this winter and have found that it keeps them soft and supple without the slimy feeling of hand cream. I've also used it as intensive therapy on my hair and found it helped restore the luster and softness.After reading all these reviews, I guess I'll need to pull it downstairs and try it for cooking too.",5
"I have been using a lot of coconut oil over the last year. It is better for you than vegetable oil and also great for skin and hair as well.  I was offered a tub of this to review by Viva Labs.First, It comes in a plastic tub (but then nearly all do). Some people are worried about plastic, you can always transfer it to a glass jar when you receive it. This plastic is BAPA free, if you are concerned.  When opening the tub, the scent is stronger and fresher than other oils I've used. Like fresh coconuts were cracked in front of me.  It is almost pure white and looks very smooth.I scooped a bit out to taste it. The taste isn't too strong but very pleasant. The texture of the oil is the smoothest I've ever tried. The oil melts easily on the tongue and doesn't linger in the mouth.  I've read that you should eat a spoon full or two a day for various ailments.  I couldn't fathom eating a spoon of other oils, because they were heavy and oil. I can eat this from a spoon, albeit slowly!  I have been replacing the vegetable oil with coconut oil in dessert recipes. It makes cakes and cookies so moist and imparts just a tiny hint of coconut aroma.  I also use it in place of butter on toast, its delicious!!!Its also good for dry skin and hair and add a bit to your dogs food to help for their dry winter skin.Another plus is that Viva Labs does a lot of certification and this is also non-GMO certified.  Its a high quality product that I will buy in the future.",5
"It took me a while to decide exactly which brand and type of coconut oil to order.  The coconut oil is to be used for cooking; therefore, having healthy (read, food grade), and good tasting, oil was important.From the reviews of all the different options I can see some people who don't care much about the flavor, and those who are too picky about it.All I can say is that this met my expectations, it is great tasting, at a decent value and I will definitely purchase it again when I'm looking for coconut oil.",5
"This Coconut oil works wonderfully! I mainly use it to make a cream for my curly 4c hair. It blends so nicely together, and smells phenomenal. I've tried a couple of different ones, but this one is by far my favorite. You wouldn't think that there would be a difference, but for some reason this one seems alot smoother vs other ones that I've tried in the past. When I need to, it melts down perfectly, and I've even tried it in certain recipes, and haven't had any problems at all with it. For me, I usually use about a 1/3 to a little less than half per cream jar, and the cream usually lasts me about a month and a half to two months, depending on how much I style, so I'd say that the value is pretty awesome.",5
I have used other coconut oils but have not found any purer and whiter than the Viva Labs product. Snow white in color and melts evenly. I highly recommend this brand.,5
"I've been using coconut oil for years, for everything from skin, hair, cooking, eating it straight & added into green smoothies. I am a researcher. I look into every aspect of anything I buy, especially Heath products. An organic stamp means nothing these days! I want to know WHERE it is sourced, HOW, & all aspects of the company. I've been a  ""HEALTHFORCE ""  supplement user/lover for years. If it's going IN my body or ON, I want the best & that's not always the most e$pensive!  Many times you are paying for a ""name"" & that's it. When I looked into VIVA LABS , I was impressed with the company ethics, sourcing of their products, & how it's made. I can be a bit of a witch when a company comes off as a ""Good wholesome "" corp & cares, then you find out all their crap is out of China & from so many different sources THEY don't know where it really comes from!! Well, I pay a lot for supplement, I care a lot about what I'm using- this is a coconut oil I feel good about & it's amazing too. Not a strong flavor, which doesn't matter to me really , but some it does. It's great straight from the jar for my MCT Daily & for moisturizing my skin, face & body. And my hair ( which I dye) LOVES this stuff!!  I have 2 other brands that are sitting there because I love this one & use it every day now. I do not recommend a product unless I love it & use it , as well as my whole family. I feel great about this & the company the makes it!Jenn Reedy~.",5
"I've used this exclusively as a body lotion/hand lotion/hair oil, because once I stuck my fingers in it, I didn't feel good about also eating it. :) I'm likely going to buy a second one for cooking purposes.I love the scent and feel of this coconut oil. When it's cold, it's a solid, and when it warms up, coconut oil turns liquid, so you may need to warm it between your hands a bit if you're using it as a body lotion like I do. I love that it's organic and non-GMO-- makes me feel a lot better about putting it on my and my daughter's skin. A guest in my home tried it and asked me to send him the link to buy it-- so that tells you something, too!",5
Give my coffee a nutty taste and a great alternative to pure MCT which cost  4 times more than coconut oil. I use coconut oil at room temperature in my smoothies.,5
This is my first time using coconut oil for beauty purposes and I love it!  I have seen some other coconut oil brands where the oil has separated from the solid (which isn't good). This stuff is completely solid. I used a spoon to scrape out a little bit and it melts in your hands like butter.  I used this as a conditioning treatment for my hair.  It smelled soooo good and did an awesome job hydrating/softening my damaged strands. Will definitely order again!,5
"Never having used this before, I decided to experiment.  I have used it to fry hamburgers, eggs, in place of butter on toast; and it has been wonderful--no sweetness on the meat or eggs, but it is sweet on toast.  Very happy so far.",4
"Cream at room temperature and oil at body temperature.  Scant scent.Not processed, but virgin oil with recent research demonstrating health benefits to virgin oils.Multiple uses.  Cooking oil.  Massage oil.  Body lubricant.For those who care, USDA organic certification.Versatile, healthy, and great price.There is no negative attribute - easy 5*****.",5
"The coconut palm has existed since man can remember. Its roots dig into the sand, planting itself in soft terrain, yet able to withstand the worst of storms. Bending with the winds and surf, a coconut palm may live 100 years.Doctors in 1954 used fresh coconut water as an IV drip in clinical trials successfully. 17 of the 157 patients were in St. Louis, within the surgical wards of the Barnes Hospital. The coconuts used there were produced in Miami, Florida.The coconut palm is the most widely grown and important palm in the world. Approximately 80 countries plant the tree. In North America, it is only grown in Florida's tropical zone: from Stuart in Martin County, south to the Keys on the Atlantic and from Pinellas Countys coast southward along the Gulf of Mexico.The word coconut means head or face first coming as ""quoquos"" in the Canarese (India) language. The base of the fruit has three holes giving it the appearance of a coco (Spanish/Portuguese) or grinning face. Its scientific classification is ""Cocos nucifera.""The coconut is not a true nut. It is instead a drupe. A drupe is a fruit with an outer flesh and a pit in the center. Another type of drupe is the date palm.The origin of the palm is debatable, but researchers do know that the American coconut predates European contact. Ancient palm fossils have been located in the Americas, Australia and India.Then God said, Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them; and it was so. Genesis 1:11The outside of the coconut is called the exocarp which is part of the husk. Within that is a hard shell known as the mesocarp another part of the husk. The final interior is the meat of the fruit, known as the endocarp from which copra is produced. The interior contains a potable water.For hundreds of years, the coconut has sustained traditional tropical human populations. In the Malay tongue, the tree is known as ""pokok seribu guna""or the tree of a thousand uses. Native cultures utilize every part of the coconut, producing copra or dried meat.Coconut oil is extracted from the copra by grating and then boiling the copra. The leftover coconut still contains some protein and large quantities of dietary fiber, leaving it inedible for human consumption. It is instead fed to animals which chew the cud, having a four-compartment stomachcattle, goats, sheep.The coconuts water contains sugar, dietary fiber, proteins, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Young coconuts provide the most amount of liquid. The water can be fermented to create a vinegar.Coconut milk is extracted from grated coconut when pressed. This removes the oil. Extra virgin coconut oil is extracted in this manner. For extra virgin coconut oil, use Viva's brand--100% certified organic and pure.  It is exceptionally delicious.Coconuts in Florida are eaten by local residents. They drink the water, scoop out the meat and even make ice cream with it.Around the world the coconut is an ingredient from curry to macaroons and is the nutritional base of many meals.",5
"One of the best coconut oils I've used. Balanced and smooth makes beautiful silky chocolates. Will use it again, definitely.",5
We received this and it smelled so good when we opened it. It was super fresh and tasty. I would totally recommend this brand of coconut oil.,5
"I use coconut oil most often for my natural hair but its also been amazing in my meals, for oil pulling as a part of my oral care routine and for the skin! Its so versatile and has tons of uses. I usually get a different brand but at this price I had to give it a try and I have been thoroughly impressed. Id recommend it to anyone trying to take their health to the next level!",5
"Would highly recommend, I even use on my face after cleansing seems to work fine so far doesn't make my face look like a coconut :)",5
I love this stuff! I've never used coconut oil before until now. I have had it for a couple weeks and it's almost gone! I use it for my kids dry skin and my hair! It has worked really well for both!,5
This was exactly what I was looking for. I use it on my skin to help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. It was a good buy compared to the ones in health food stores that were triple the price..,5
"This is the perfect oil since it is so pure and has a high smoke point, it makes it perfect for stir fry and adds a nice flavor to shrimp.  I am supposed to eat more omega rich foods and I really don't like salmon, so the answer is chia seeds mixed with a bit of this oil and some dates to make bars.  Easy and no baking.I have super dry skin and when you warm a bit of this up in your hands and add some moisturizer, it adds staying power!  It soaks into your skin and is really hydrating.  I also tried a bit (not more than a 1/4 teaspoon) added into my hair condition and it stopped those horrible flyaways and made my hair super shiny.  I also use this straight on my feet which get horribly dry during winter.  I have super sensitive skin and I have not had any reactions at all.",5
"First off, I must say that I was sent a free jar of this coconut oil with the understanding that I would provide a review.  It didn't have to be a positive review, just a review.  That said, I do like this product very much.  For me, the thing that really distinguishes it is it's smooth, creamy texture and that it is certified organic and pure.  I love the way it softens my skin and I also use a little of it to fry up my asparagus--great flavor.  The scent is a little 'coconutty' (no surprise), but it fades in a few moments and thus is not offensive.",5
"We received this product as a gift.  The Coconut Oil comes in a plastic vacuum packed container and seals nicely after initially opening.  Depending on the ambient temperature of the room or storage the Coconut Oil will be either in a liquid or soft paste form.  We decided to use the Coconut Oil as a cooking additive.  We cooked eggs, home fired potatoes and and several baking products (cakes).  The aroma of the Coconut Oil was an added treat while cooking eggs and potatoes...you could almost taste it in the air.  The taste of the Coconut Oil was not overwhelming when used to fry with.  We also used the Coconut Oil to bake some of our favorite cakes.  The Coconut Oil added a great flavor when added.  All and all we found this product to be exceptional and strongly recommend it.",5
"My whole family loves the  taste of this coconut oil.Easy to use and use it to fry food and in baking goods. Have not used it on skin or hair yet, but will try it sometime.Great price too.James OrvisauthorWeight Training Workouts that Work - book series.",5
"Compared to other coconut oils I have used, this one is far creamier and smoother. The ""Extra"" virgin aspect of this coconut oil really shines through in the flavor profile, as there is a rich coconut taste present. The oil works great for cooking and for cosmetics.  I've used it for making a homemade body butter, and it produced luxurious results. I would definitely recommend this brand of organic extra virgin coconut oil.",5
"I usually don't spend time writing reviews.  However, I really felt compelled to write one for this great product.  It is simply the best coconut oil that I have ever tasted.  And I have tried them all!  I used to buy Nutiva, which I used to think was great until I discovered Viva Labs' Coconut Oil. I will never buy from another brand again!",5
"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Coconut Oil by Viva Labs.  I regularly use Coconut Oil in my cooking/baking and this brand has a smooth nutty flavor.  It added layers of flavor to a few different dishes I make regularly.  I liked the consistency for home uses too like a moisture treatment for my hair. For the quality, this will replace my normal brand of coconut oil.  Home run, Viva Labs!",5
"this coconut is a good for my hair, oil pulling, clean make up cosmetic. This brand has a good promotion and cheap price but good quality. i hope you can develop market by do refine coconut for cooking food without smell.",5
"So unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you've likely heard how good coconut oil is for you. It's one of those few dream products that works wonders both inside and outside the body, not unlike baking soda and apple cider vinegar.For cooking, you can replace the cooking oil in your recipes (olive or any seed/vegetable oils) with coconut oil for multiple health benefits and a light, fresh, nutty taste. Works beautifully with grilled shrimp, stir frys, tofu, in soups, on lightly grilled veggies. I still prefer olive oil for Italian dishes, but for nearly everything else, coconut is the thing.But here's the awesome thing - it's also a brilliant addition to your beauty regimen! A fine layer over freshly washed skin will nourish, moisturize, and add a healthy glow without irritating sensitive skin or clogging pores. Apply it to the roots of your hair after shampooing, or give yourself a long oil treatment on the weekends to add amazing shine and softness, without the need for drugstore products that are loaded with unpronounceable chemicals, dyes, and perfumes. I guarantee you will love the look and feel of the results.But what makes Viva my top choice? Quite simply, it's pure and light with a delicate slightly nutty aroma, very clear and clean compared to other brands I've tried. When I ordered my first bottle, I tried it out side-by-side with my usual brand (which happens to be the top selling brand of organic coconut oil sold at WholeFoods) and found the Viva to be clearer, lighter and easier to use. I'm not exactly sure why, since they are both pure coconut oil, but something about the process Viva uses is superior. And they're the same price. So switching was a no-brainer.The oil does come in a plastic jar, which is a little tricky to work with in the bathroom, so I purchased 2 reusable opaque glass bottles and split it up - one for the kitchen, one for the bath. And then put it on my monthly shopping list so I'll always have it on hand.",5
"NOTE: I received a free sample for the purpose of writing a review.I live in the Arizona desert, but unlike another review on here, the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in my house remained a solid until I heated it. I left it room temperature with my olive oil in August, and it did not melt.I was impressed with the quality of this product. It tasted of coconut but not in an overpowering or artificial way. I used it to saute vegetables and even cook chicken and it gave everything a hint of tropical flavor. As a supplement, I took one tablespoon each day spread on a warm tortilla and it was delicious. I can't say for certain if it enhanced my health but it tasted better than fish oil!As a hair conditioner, I would pass. It is too concentrated as an oil to rinse or wash out easily.  As a skin moisturizer, it definitely absorbs well for a softer texture that lasts until you wash your hands.All in all, I would recommend this product for a healthy dietary alternate to take alone or use to cook.",4
I seriously love this stuff! I use it as moisturizer on my face and my hair.  My daughter and my husband tell me how great I smell and it is so moisturizing!!  I'll definitely order more!,5
"Love this coconut oil, use it for every thing from hair care, skin care to cooking.  very pleasant scent as well",5
"I've tried to use numerous brands of coconut oil as a supplement straight from the container, by the spoonful but my gagging reflex would kick in BIG time!!!.  I feel nauseous, like I'm going hurl.  Not so with this brand.  The fact that I can take this coconut oil brand as supplement straight from the jar with ease is telling of its purity to me.",5
"I bought this for dry skin and after just one application, my skin was not as dry. I would recommend this product if you have dry skin.",4
"I use this coconut oil as my regular moisturizer.  It works very nicely, and I love the coconut smell.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the product is solid, not the liquid oil one might expect if one were unfamiliar with coconut oil.  I can scrape out what I need easily with my finger nails and rub it in my palms, and it becomes liquid and works well as a lotion replacement.",5
"We use this as recommended by our Ear,nose and throat doctor to lubricate our noses during the winter months. It spells yummy so it's easier to get the kids to use it (as opposed to using Vaseline).",5
I have a rescued German Shepherd Dog that has food allergies. When she was adopted we tried many different brands of food and finally got some relief with Natural Balance L.I.D. We then added a tablespoon of coconut oil to her diet every morning and night. She LOVES it and the coconut oil has added oil to her dry skin and shine to her coat. She's more calm since she is not scratching all the time. Thanks!,5
"And this stuff is GMO free, organic, smells great, is a nice quantity and all for a very good price. I used to buy the one from the grocery store that was also organic and stuff but it was almost $11 a small jar.",5
"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS PRODUCT.  WILL BE AREPEAT CUSTOMER.  THIS IS BETTER THAN BUTTER,LIGHT, DELICIOUS TASTE.  LOVE THIS ORGANIC OIL.",5
"I've recently been switched on to how great Coconut oil is, so I couldn't wait to try this kind out. The container it comes in is the perfect size--not too big and bulky if you're storing it in a bathroom cabinet for the many beauty uses of coconut oil, but large enough to contain a good amount that will last awhile if you're using it to cook.I've used this to cook with and I especially love the flavoring it gave to my pork chops--not to mention the additional value the nutrients provide (google coconut oil benefits if you want to get an official report on them).When my daughter was super sick with a nasty cold I used it to diffuse essential oil and apply it to her chest. She has eczema and the coconut oil proved to be the perfect diffuser as it spread it out quickly and easily, and didn't break her skin out.The quality of this brand and the fact it's USDA certified organic are just the icing on the cake--I will definitely be purchasing it in the future!",5
"Good quality Coconut oil, I have used it for soap making and cooking, found it to be easy to use and nice smelling. Good price for the amount I got, truly no complaints.",5
"So far, I have only used this coconut oil in three ways:1. As a treatment for my hair - I put it on a few minutes before I stepped in the shower, carefully avoiding the roots because I do not want my hair to get too oily. Then I shampoo'd and rinsed it off..skipped the conditioner. RESULT : Hair that looks and feels healthy after it dried, best of all : Not frizzy and not greasy at all! Will be doing this at least once a week.2. As a skin moisturizer - i love the subtle coconut smell while slathering it on. It gets absorbed easily and the scent doesnt stay. I love it, but in the heavy winter months when skin is more dry, this needs to be used along with another moisturizer.3. As butter on my toasted bread - as soon as the bread comes out of the toaster, I use this as a spread and then sprinkle a bit of sugar. YUM!I haven't used it for cooking yet, as I keep forgetting. Out of habit, we always reach for our traditional cooking oil.",5
The best oil anyone can use whether you ingest or use topically.  Great for almost anything that ails your body,5
Thank you for the fast shipping.  this has worked wonders with my daughter's acne it has almost cleared it up and it is lightening up her scaring (she had severe acne).  I don't know how I feel about it on my face yet I'm 39 and although it makes it soft it hasn't dimished the redness yet but i still have hopes for it. It is great in substitue of shaving cream it made the razor glide effortlessly and no razor bumps.,5
"I Love it, it feels great on my skin and helps keep my heels and elbows soft.  The only downside is that the container gets oily, and needs to be washed off.  I actually keep it by my bed, on a coaster.",5
This coconut oil tastes delicious!  I put it in smoothies and use it to cook.  I even put any extra leftover on measuring spoons on my hands because it leaves them so soft.,5
"Not to long about coconut oil was slammed as an unhealthy fat. But current research indicates that the unique blend of fatty acids in the oil may offer many benefits. However, people have gone over board pushing it as a miracle weight loss tool. Proponents suggest eating it by the tablespoon to curb hunger and melt fat.Though it may have benefits it still has about 120 calories per tablespoon along with 14 grams of fat and no vitamins or minerals. And most of the fat is saturated. Many nutritionist's recommend using unsaturated fats like canola or vegetable oil over a saturated fat like coconut oil. And gobbling it by the tablespoon is unlikely to result in a trim body but more likely to pack on the pounds.The oil is very nice as a body and hair moisturizer. It works well on cuticles, rough elbows and to smooth fly away tresses. This jar contains a generous 15 ounces and should last a long time. Good price point for the size. It smells good too!Overall, this is a nice quality oil that offers many benefits. Just don't believe all the weight loss hype surrounding coconut oil.",4
"Excellent tasting coconut oil.  It adds such a wonderful taste to the items I cook in it such as eggs, that I am thrilled to know it is so healthy for me to eat at the same time.  I highly recommend Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for it's high quality and delicious taste.",5
"I started using coconut oil for my entire body, face included, and have never had a better moisturizer.  I love it!",5
"I absolutely love this oil.  I have stomach problems and fats are hard for me to digest, but this oil is very easy on my stomach, and not only that but provides me with the fatty oils and Medium Chain Fatty Acids my body needs.  ANd not only that but it tastes great!  It can be used in a wide variety of foods and really adds to the flavor of anything sweet or salty!But what I think I love more than even eating it is using it on my skin.  It is a great skin conditioner...and in all honesty me and my girlfriend really love using it as an exotic massage oil.  It smells wonderful and feels great when used on massage, and of course is edible too for your erotic massages.  What a versatile product!  I highly recommend you try it!",5
I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT IS ORGANIC AND OF VERY GOOD QUALITY AND YES I WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN SOON . I HAVE TRIED OTHERS AND THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YET!! I RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.,5
This coconut oil is a quality product....I have been using it for cooking and as a moisturizer for dry hands.  It works!,5
Great in coffee.  Good to cook with- coconut doesn't flavor food very much at all.  Doesn't taste great by itself.,4
"This is the first coconut oil product I have tried, but have been very pleased. I mix it with tea tree and lemon oil to make a moisturizer for my face and with lavender to put on dry knees and elbows. It has worked wonders. I also mix it with shea butter to use on my daughters' hair. Again I have had great results-less knots and pulling. I bought a second tub to use for cooking which I am still experimenting with. Overall I am very pleased with this product.",5
I have been using this in my hair and I have already noticed the difference. My hair is shiny and no longer dry,5
"If you love coconut oil this is the one for you... excellent quality and great packaging.. buy it today, you won't be sorry",5
"Love it! This stuff is fantastic. Smells great, tastes great and I will definitely be buying again. Great price for a great product!",5
"Really good. I usually get Nutiva though this is as good if not better. Taste, consistency and processed well. Great product.",5
"This is my first time ordering this brand and it's great! I use from cooking to beauty! I substitute other oils when making popcorn (old fashion - I don't use microwave), to saut veggies, etc. I love it for hair masks too. I add few drops of tea tree oil to help with dry scalp. I even use after shower as a moisturizer. Coconut oil is a must have!",5
"i have been using coconut oil for years for every use you can think of; dry skin, facial moisturizer, lip balm, homemade deodorant, toothpaste, you name it, i use it.  I find it equally amazing for my 7 and 6 month old.  my daughter loves to smell like a macaroon after using it as body moisturizer!that being said, i have used all brands of coconut oil...i always try new ones to see if some are better.  some smell better, melt easier, absorb faster, etc....well, this is the ONE for me now! It's leaps and bounds amongst its competitors! its literally, hands down, the best organic, coconut oil EVERRRRR.",5
I use it for my skin and it works wonders! Smells great and makes my skin super soft. Good treatment for KP.,5
"This is the best Coconut oil I ever bought, period. I used to make my own from dry coconut but, got tired of the process. In my search, I came across this on amazon and decided to give it a try, I was never disappointed. If you have an EXTREMELY dry skin, you will appreciate this product. Melts easily and spreads evenly, and will keep your skin moisturized ALL day.This is how good the product is: We have a four weeks old baby who had some kind of thick, dry dandruff under his hair (I guess residue from birth) and anytime we tried combing it peeled off skin and sore under his hair. The dr wasn't that helpful, he kept asking us to bring him in for checkup, saying it might be the harsh Winter weather. We decided to stop using the Cutizone or whatever the hospital gave us and just go with the Coconut oil. Within three days, 90% of the thick dandruff had soften and fallen out. Anytime we used the Coconut oil baby's hair became very soft, shiny and remained moisturized all day. We went for a checkup on the fifth day of use and the Dr was absolutely shocked by the results, He said the dandruff had cleared too fast and the sores healed. At which point we had to tell him we stopped using the medication he prescribed and used Coconut oil. He goes, ""oh, I never knew coconut oil could do that.""This review is only for how I used it; skin and hair application, I have not tried it for any other use.I HIGHLY recommend this product for that purpose.",5
This oil is works like magic. I use it for my skin and hair. Leaves my skin moist and leaves my hair moist as well. Works great as a treatment after you wash your hair. Just follow the directions on the jar. Highly Recommend! Must have!!,5
"When I first started having serious arthritic problems decades ago, my sister introduced me to Osteo-Biflex (aka Glucosamine/Chondroitin complex).  I mention the product on this coconut oil review page because little was known about Glucosamine/Chondroitin at the time, except that it was given to horses.  Well, as time progressed, patients were recommending the product to their doctors and today its a popular anti-arthritic supplement that is used with other nutrients that benefit joints and cartilage.  Based on what Ive read and seen about coconut oil, this short chain fatty acid might be the next wonder product that consumers have discovered and are now sharing its role against dementia and other related problems with their medical practitioners.  You can judge for yourself by viewing a few of the videos on You Tube (Ive included the URL links below.  If you cant link on, highlight the address, copy it, and paste it onto your browsers Search bar).As for coconut oils other attributes: Its delicious on or in many foods, including for making pancakes, cakes, pie crusts, and rice and meat dishes.  A contractor that was working in my apartment uses it on his bread as a substitute for butter.  In my opinion, its more flavorful than extra virgin olive oil.  Because its a short chain fatty acid, it doesnt behave like the other saturated long chain oils (animal fats and butter).  It decomposes quickly and wont clog your arteries as long chain fatty acids and hydrogenated oils such as margarine tend to do.As mentioned in other reviews, coconut oil is excellent for skin and hair.  Author Bruce Fife also says its good for teeth and gums.Suggestions: Unless you can store it in ice cube trays (with Saran Wrap) so theyll be easy to remove, dont refrigerate coconut oil.  Although cooling it might prevent it from spoiling quicker, the colder coconut oil gets the harder and more difficult it is to spoon out.  In warm temperatures it behaves as any other oil and will flow easily.Recommended reading: The Coconut Oil Miracle by Bruce FifeThe You Tube Video List:Part I: Drs.

Excellent quality! We used it not just in cooking but also on the skin and got excellent results. A must buy.,5
"I have been using this for several weeks now. We use it as lotion for myself and my toddler (both have eczema), and for diaper cream as needed (we cloth diaper). I really like this brand! It has a much smoother consistency than several others I've tried. It seems to stay solid better in the jar, and melts very nicely when warmed by touch. I may be switching to this brand for future use! I really like it.",5
"I have never tried coconut oil before, believing it was some sort of new age hoax mixed with a hyper-inflated sense of self worth; however, I was wrong. It would appear coconut oil is something that is healthy, serves a variety of uses, and tastes good.I did not dip pretzel rods into it. Maybe I did, but you cannot prove it.There are healthy benefits to it, besides cooking. You can actually eat it as a vitamin supplement. For cooking, replace butter or those chemicals called margarine with coconut oil. I've used it on sweet potatoes for starters and found it made them taste that much better - better than I could imagine. I've used it on roasted vegetables to the same culinary satisfaction.I've fried smaller items in it as well. There is no greasy taste to the foods and the oil maintained its consistency even through several fries.We are all looking for ways to eat better without sacrificing taste. As someone raised in the Deep South where we deep fry everything, I was hesitant. As someone who loves butter, I was scared. But, my fears were set aside as I discovered how good this oil allowed my foods to be.",5
"Great flavor.  Purchased after being on a health-related seminar presented by a physician who recommended coconut oil.  I use it with black coffee, Truvia, and 70% cacao.  I just put 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of the coconut oil.",5
This coconut oil is excellent. I use it to season my pans along with using it in cooking. Just the smallest piece makes my pans coated so nothing sticks and clean up is so easy. I have also tried using it in place of shortening in some receipts and this has not only been adding the nice taste of coconut but the texture is much improved. I have added them to scones and cookies so far.,5
This smells and tastes more like coconut than the other brands I have used. I use it for all my cooking and for popcorn.  Great product.,5
"excellent coconut oil, have a coconut taste to it, and is completely clear when melted.I use it as a hair moisturizer and to cook with.",5
"Great value and product.  I actually read and heard from a friend that coconut oil can help your hair grow healthier, and thicker.  I was a skeptic but gave it a shot.  I've been using it three nights a week by melting a teaspoon an using a medicine syringe to drop it into my scalp. I massage it in and leave it on 2 hours or over night ( gotta wash your pillow case if you do).  My hair seems to have responded already as I've had people tell me my hair seems thicker.  It's only been a month, but I'm gonna keep trying it.  I heard its good for cooking too, though I haven't used it for that yet.",5
"I have not used coconut oil before so I have nothing to compare with, but I like how this coconut oil tastes. I  brush my teeth with it and I put a few drops of it in a little bit of lukewarm water and use it as mouthwash.",5
"I received a free container of this product to try. To test it I waited until the weather turned cold & my skin began to feel dry. To test it, I used this product on left leg & arm, and Sebamed moisturizing lotion for sensitive skin on right arm & leg.  I applied these products once a day - before bedtime, for 3days. At the end of this test both sides of my body felt equally moisturized.Pros of Viva Labs product- it will definitely last longer than a lotion moisturizer & lack of multiple ingredients reduces risk that your skin may react to it.Cons- it comes in a tub & it takes some patience to apply because the product is hard until the warmth of your fingers melts the top layer. It of course made my body smell like coconut, but in the morning the smell had declined enough that I don't think anyone standing near me would notice. Finally, I usually avoid any skin product that comes in a tub because each time you put your fingers in it you are transferring bacteria into it. I am not a chemist & don't know if harmful types of bacteria are likely to multiply in coconut oil.If you favor organic products or skin care products without a lot of chemicals, & if you are not allergic to coconut, this seems like a good option.  And of course, if you have a partner or spouse at home, make sure she or he is okay with the smell of coconut!",4
"Always willing to try anything once, I can honestly say that ""Viva's Coconut Oil"" will be used by me on the permanent basis.  I love plantains and decided to use ""Viva's"" instead of vegetable oil.  Let me just say that plantains have never tasted so good. For oatmeal lovers such as myself, try the oil in your hot cereal versus butter with a little cinnamon, and some raisins. Thanks to ""Viva's"", both breakfast and healthy snack items will never be the same.  Look forward to trying other products by this company.",4
"I really love this product!!!  It smells and tastes great.  I have cooked everything with it.  Veggies, fish, chicken...you name it.  It has a very high smoking point so it doesn't scorch.  It has a strong coconut smell/flavor on it's own because it's ""Extra Virgin"", but along with your seasonings, it doesn't overpower.  Don't be discouraged if you don't like the flavor of coconut, because I've never had it leave any coconut taste.  My son hates coconut and he has never detected it in anything I've made.I also use it to mix with essential oils for various purposes.  It is fantastic.  Yes, it has a harder consistency when it's cold.  That is the nature of coconut oil.  It warms very quickly and it doesn't leave your skin greasy.  It feels wonderful.The best part is that this product is organic and GMO free.  Since this is something that we both ingest and apply topically, it is very important to me that it doesn't have chemicals or GMOs.  The health benefits of coconut oil are amazing and I won't use anything else anymore.  If you've never tried coconut oil before, you won't be disappointed.  If you already like coconut oil, then you should try this one.  You will love it!",5
"I'm a huge coconut oil fan. It is so versatile.  I use it in cooking instead of butter, as a natural lotion on my hands and face and mix it with baking soda to use as a face-wash.  Viva Labs' coconut oil has great flavor and I appreciate that it is organic and GMO-free.",5
Great for really dry skin after a bath!!!  You can also cook with it!!! Both my husband and I love it!!!,5
"I was asked to try this Coconut oil because I had previously purchased a heel cream. I thought, heck, why not? I had no previous experience using coconut oil for ANYTHING. Not cooking, Not beauty. I was so surprised when I started to use this oil for my dry hands and feet. WOW! Not only does it have the bonus yumminess of a Mounds bar smell, but IT REALLY WORKS! I am now a convert.A tip when using it on skin: it will start as a solid in normal room temperatures, but has a low melting point, so will immediately feel like you are rubbing a very watery oil on your skin. It will be very oily. Do not be alarmed. Do not wipe off the excess. Believe it or not, within about 10-15 minutes, it will have completely absorbed into the skin, just leaving a feeling of silkiness.If you can for feet, apply about 5 minutes after soaking or showering them. Apply liberally, put feet in a plastic bag (old school) or those fancy silicon socks they sell on Amazon. Leave them about a half hour. Remove socks/bags and let the oil absorb as usual. My mom has had horribly cracked and bleeding heels, and once she started doing the above, she was amazed how much her feet have healed.So even though this was initially a solicited product (not one I sought out), I am so grateful that I was asked to try it, or I would never have known how terrific coconut oil is for your skin. The price looks right on track as well. I just saw some organic EV Coconut oil being sold at Costco (big box store), and it was selling for around $15 (it was a bit over a pound worth... I think this one is a more manageable size for beauty use).",5
"Great deal!  It's exactly the same as some of the more expensive brands,and with fast shipping you couldn't ask for anything more.  I plan to be a returning customer.",5
"This was delivered on time and in good condition.  It smells good and works for what I wanted it for, scrubs and lotion bars.",5
"I love this coconut oil. I use it for my hair, skin care, and for food. I recommend this product to others",5
I have received this product. It arrived very quickly. Great value for the price. My doctor recommended this product for dry skin problems.,5
"I've been a big fan of using coconut oil for stir fry and this brand puts a great product.  It adds a hint of coconut to your food without overpowering the flavor, cooks food evenly without smoking (at a medium high temperature) and is priced right. The fact its organic and non-GMO is an extra bonus.",5
Amazing great for skin & hair. Smells awesome! Gets rid of dry skin & helps with handling frizz on my hair.,5
"I love this stuff! I use it every night on my face after I shower and it's oily but it dries up quick and when I wake up in the morning, it's all gone. It smells wonderful and it's a huge jar so it will last a long time! I am on accutane so it def helps with the dryness! Recommend!",5
"I was approached to receive a sample of this coconut oil by one of the people working at Viva. They were very kind, sent a container to me quickly, and followed up with me after a few weeks. I've used it for cooking and it works great. I usually use bacon fat or olive oil and this works just as well and adds a tangy flavor. I don't use it as a moisturizer or supplement daily but it would be good at that too. I like this coconut oil.",4
I use coconut oil as a deep conditioner for my hair and on my skin and scalp to soothe my eczema.  Prior to this purchase I've just been buying an inexpensive refined coconut oil from the shelf of my local grocer.  There is a definite difference in this oil.  It is clearly high quality and has a smooth and silky texture at melting point.  I've found it to be way more moisturizing to my skin and hair than the other oil that I have been using.  I was able to purchase it on sale at a good price.  If I had known that it was going to be the excellent quality that it is I would have purchased two.,5
"This is my favorite brand of Coconut Oil! I use it for oil pulling, moisturizing, my hair, and cooking. This is the best brand out there, and just happens to be a great value as well.",5
"I absolutely love organic coconut oil. I use it to deep condition my hair, moisturize my face, remove make up, eye lash care, and so much more! This stuff is decently big for a good price. Which is perfect for me. Love it!",5
"I ordered 2 jars. One for making lotions etc., and one for the kitchen.  It is very creamy and I like using it a lot.  made some lotion bars yesterday and they turned out great.",5
Never had cocoanut oil before and after reading reviews for different kinds I thought this one fit best for cooking. It is wonderful. My husband and son even didn't protest. It is kind of a lard substance in my cabinet temperature but it forks out easy enough. I can smell the cocoanut and when I just put a little oil in the pan I can't even tell it's a different oil. But I love cocoanut and got a little carried away a couple of times and put way to much in and you could then taste it in the food which I loved but my husband wasn't to happy about this particular omelet since it tasted the equivalent to cocoanut shrimp-yumm!  I recommend this to anyone who is thinking of trying it. I did see a larger jar that was a dollar less at SAMs club and was also usda approved. I can't remember if it said organic or not but it looked like it might be same brand.  If so I will be buying it from there in future even though I love my amazon some stuff seems to be getting pricey even though they have the BEST customer service at least for their kindles,5
This product works wonders on your hair . I recently cut off my long bleach blonde hair and dyed it back to its natural color . I put this product on my scalp and throughout my hair twice a week and my hair is healthy and growing better than it ever has . It is very greasy so I suggest washing more than once when washing it out . I leave mine in overnight and wash it out in the morning . I definitely recommend this product,4
I have read a lot recently about the value of coconut oil and decided to give this a try.I used some to cook rice and fish and it was delicious! I also used some on my skin and it had a great moisturizing effect.  I can understand now why it is so popular.I bought a second jar for a friend from the Caribbean and he was thrilled as it reminded him of home.he thought it was great quality and just like he grew up with.,5
"Excellent as a hair moisturizer, cooking oil, massage oil and many other things. It is also a great skin moisturizer.",5
"received on time! It was exactly as described. It came as a solid but if you  heat it up, it becomes a liquid.",5
"Light oil. Not sticky. Really helps soften the skin, plus is helping heal my scar from major knee surgery. It also helps me when I have to massage my knee to break up scar tissue. I also occasionally use it with Vitamin E oil. In addition to helping my knee, my hands are softer. The seller also has very fast shipping, which is greatly appreciated.",5
"I use the Viva Labs Coconut Oil as a moisturizer for my scalp and hair.  It has a nice light fragrance and gives my hair a beautiful sheen.  I would, however recommend that any one who uses it for this purpose moisturize their hair overnight and wrap it in a silk scarf to avoid an oversaturated appearance.",4
"I love this product. At this posting there is +465 reviews with 5 star rating. (thats what convinced us to buying) My wife using this for her skin, lips, and hair. We use it to cook everything. It replaces anything we use EV olive oil/veg oil or butter for, even toast. It is great quality and affordable. Give it a try and you'll see; you'll love it too!",5
They sent the coconut oil quickly. I got it in less than a week.This coconut oil is easily absorbed and doesn't have an overpowering smell of coconut.I will buy this product again when I run out.,4
"I love it spread on toast with cinnamon. I also use coconut oil as the only body and face moisturizer I need, threw all my expensive creams full of crap away!",5
"Was very pleased with this product. I had to get used to the thicker consistency but after working it in my hands for a few minutes, it works great.  I use it on hands, face, feet to protect and soften skin against cold weather.  Will certainly use it again.",4
"So Happy with this product... this was delivered in a very timely manner and was exactly what I wanted. I will be back for more, that's for sure.",5
"I initially bought this for oil-pulling. But my AM routine became too long and I stopped and began to put 1 tsp into my oatmeal every morning. To me, it tastes heavenly. I also have used it as a moisturizer. When I've compared prices, I find this to be a great online buy, for which I'm grateful. It's very challenging to find healthy products, etc. on a low income...but worth the challenge if you're determined to heal, as I am. Highly recommended.",5
"Coconut oil has over 100 uses both externally and internally.  I needed a jar to keep separate from kitchen use.  This one I use for external body use, hair, skin and mouthwash.",5
"Best coconut oil i have ever bought, must have for your hair care. Arrived earlier than the estimated time, smells good, very smooth on your hair.",5
"if you love kettle corn like I do, use this simple recipe to get great tasting kettle corn! melt 3-4 tablespoons of the coconut oil in a large pot using medium high heat. spread 1/2 cup of popping corn in the pot and cover and wait for the kernels to begin to pop. abouut 2 minutes after the corn starts to pop, lower the heat to medium low and turn the pot clockwise on the stove every few seconds. when the corn stops popping, throw 3 tablespoons of sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of salt on top of the corn.while holding the lid on the pot, remove the pot from the stove and vigorously shake the pot sideways, round and round,(even over your head if you are brave enough lol) any way you can to spread the sugar all over the popcorn. I use a clear top so I can see if the sugar is all melted but any top will do. the trick is to melt the sugar without burning it. I swear I have never had such good tasting kettle corn in my LIFE! this coconut oil makes anything you use it in tastes HEAVENLY! I will be ordering this product faithfully from now onUPDATE 1/4/14 - I just received my second jar of this stuff, and I will be using it exclusively for popping my kettle corn!",5
Love the coconut oil! I use it in my hair. It leaves it very shiney and soft. I also use it on my skin and it soaks in to my skin leaving it soft and moisturized!,5
I have amazing results with coconut oil.  I originally bought this to help treat my Golden Retriever for ear fungus.  She had lost all the hair on her ears and they have become cauliflowered due to this chronic condition.  She has been on this for about a month now and she is showing positive results.  Hair is coming back and the blisters in her ears are deminishing.  Coconut oil has my vote.I received my order in just a few days from ordering it.  It is wonderful!!!!!,5
"I have purchased several brands of coconut oil and Viva is by far the best, The taste, scent  and consistency are outstanding.",5
"The big difference between Viva Extra Virgin Coconut oil and other brands I've picked up at the grocery store is the taste and aroma.  Viva smells like pure, sweet, coconut oil essence without any impurities that can create ""off"" odors and flavors, and there is a big difference between it and other brands.I have used this in all recipes where delicate taste is important, and have been pleased with the results.  It has many applications in the kitchen, from making sweet confections to using as a stir fry oil for Asian inspired recipes.",5
"This coconut oil is a great product. I use it for my hair, skin and cooking. The smell is amazing!",5
"I like coconut oil  and your product is so good for my skin, hair and food. I particularly like the portion and easy to get into with a spoon or spatula. I recommend this multipurpose product, it's so good for you and it smells great too!",5
I love the coconut oil. I bought it to use on my hair and noticed an immediate difference the first time I used it. I have fine thinning hair. It's been falling out lately due to medication changes. It won't stop my hair from falling out but the hair that I have left has much more body and volume. It's in solid form and if you dig it out with your fingers it melts in your hand fairly quickly. I put it in my hair at night and sleep with it in. The only thing I can say that I didn't like is it had a very intense coconut smell. Now that I've been using it for a few weeks I really don't notice it. Maybe because the containers been opened and some of it's gone.,5
"I bought this to use on the keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms. I applied it everyday after my shower, my arms cleared up in like 2 weeks. That seems like a long time to work but when nothing else has worked at all so Ill take it!I actually put in on my face too. I have combination skin and EVERYthing causes it to breakout and with the dry weather here, I needed help. This is what I do now. After I was my face, I put on my moisturizer, which soaks right in and I still feel tight and dry. So I take a pea size amount of coconut oil, spread it all over my palms and rub onto my face! It seals in my skins moisture and I dont break out anymore! I think it might be protecting my facial skin!? My face also looks healthier, I used to have to wear bbcream and blush but now my skin tone is more even and I look like I have life in my face!I also started eating it, I mix it 50/50 with butter to make a heathier toast for my 1.5 and 3.5 year old daughters and I cook our eggs in it too.So yeah, two thumbs way up for this oil.",5
Amazing product! I use this for my skin and it cleared it up a lot and feels so much better and it's only been like 2 weeks. Love it!,5
I am sorry it has taken me so long to review this wonderful product but I've been testing it out for weeks now and wanted to make sure it worked as well as i thought it might considering how pure it is. It is really wonderful. I use it as a night cream and I use it to cook with and I use it as a conditioner for my hair...10 stars.,5
"Initially, I only used coconut oil for my natural hair and I was using a major brand not marketed as ""organic."" The major brand was less than stellar which made me want to stop using coconut oil in general. I went to my local whole foods type store and purchased some no frills organic coconut oil and started using it on my hair and body. This organic coconut oil was ok but kind of ""rough"" if that makes sense. When I received the Viva Labs brand and began using it on my hair/body it was AMAZING. I have been using this brand for a couple of months before I posted this review to give a honest/unbiased review. Having used other brands commerical and organic, I find that the Viva Lab brand has a certain ""smoothness"" that made me fall in love with it. I see this brand being my staple coconut oil.**A container of this product was provided by the manufacturer for a honest review. The opinions and views shared are strictly my own.",5
"Works as expected, but I don't have anything to compare it to because this is the first time I've used coconut oil. I used some to make diaper cream and it's working fine so far!",5
"Awesome product, I like to cook french fries with it. It makes them nice and crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside.",5
"I have tried several coconut oils in glass and plastic jars and this is by far one of the best. It has a very smooth texture, not gritty like most coconut oils.  It melts very fast which makes it great for use with essential oils.  It absorbs fast also and  does not leave a greasy feel.  The price is reasonable, very comparable to other coconut oils. Plus it's organic",5
"Simply, the most fabulous oil on earth!!!!!!It is wonderful to use on skin and hair.  Smells heavenly!!!!  Great product!",5
"Love this. Smells great. I use it in my homemade body wash, as a moisturizer, and rub it on my kids.",5
"Fantastic flavor, non-gmo certified and certified organic- this is my new favorite coconut oil.Honestly, the fantastic flavor is the main reason. I've been using other brands for my cooking and this is so fragrant when it's cooking and adds so much flavor that it's impressive. Want the best popcorn ever? Pop it in this oil and top it with your favorite salt (I like Himalayan pink on my popcorn) and optionally melted butter. Staying in for a movie night has never been better.It's also good for cosmetic coconut oil uses, but right now I'm using up my other coconut oil that way because this tastes too good not to use it in cooking.[The product reviewed was provided to me at no cost for the purposes of review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product.]",5
"Good coconut oil, with great flavor. I only wish that it came in a glass container instead of a plastic one.",5
"Excellent quality, and priced right.  It has a very good coconut  smell. I cook with it and l also use it on my skin, best inexpensive skin care product",5
"I have tried several coconut oils and this is THE BEST, hands down. Regardless of the price!I've tried many ( including Nutiva, LouAna, Trader Joe's, and others) and this is the ultra best.I eat 2 tablespoons a day and it tastes great, I ""dental pull"" with it, use it on my face, neck, and all over my body, twice a day in the winter, when my skin gets very dry and used to flake.While I still have some Nutiva for cooking. I am totally in love with Viva's Coconut oil.Just try it, you'll see and taste the difference.",5
Why did I give this 5 stars?  Because it is the best organic coconut oil I have come across since I started using coconut oil both on my skin and in my diet!,5
"I've bought a few types of organic extra virgin coconut oil including Jarrow, but after reading reviews on Amazon I decided to try Viva.While I can't comment on the nutritional aspects, the taste has felt ""smoother"" and the flavor warmer and richer, though it's still coconut oil. I eat it raw in the mornings and I cook with it regularly. I find it adds a rich, soft but not overwhelming flavor to vegetables and meat, and I eat it in quinoa when I run out of grass fed butter. Also, I personally think it balances wonderfully with spicy food.I would recommend this brand to my friends, though I've found it's a bit on the pricey side.",5
"This coconut oil has many uses - including cooking - but as I am not much of a cook, I mainly used it for my skin and hair. The skin between my knuckles tends to itch and break down every winter because of the dry air in the house. I used this coconut oil at night and put on some cotton gloves. In the morning, my skin was like butter.I've also been an avid user of Moroccan Oil/Argan oil for my hair, but recently found out that most of the popular products contain very little argan oil and are mostly chock full of chemicals. Tiny bottles of 100% argan oil are usually $20 or more. Although you do have to use this Viva Labs Coconut Oil very sparingly as it can make hair greasy, a small dollop does an excellent job of making my hair softer, more manageable and in this cold air, less static-y.",5
"I was given a jar of Viva coconut oil to try. It is my delight to report that it is an excellent coconut oil: however, unless they can beat the price I pay for a larger jar of a different brand at my local Costco, I will probably not be purchasing Viva Labs from Amazon.Viva Labs Coconut Oil has a wonderful fragrance and taste. I like it on my toast with cinnamon sugar. It also makes wonderful popcorn and bakes up well in pancakes, muffins, and breads. Like all coconut oil, it is quite solid in my home where the temperature is rarely over 70 F.It is a valuable ingredient in skin creams but I would not use it without mixing with other oils. This is my favorite recipe:Peppermint Whipped Face and Body Butter with Coconut OilIngredients: cup Coconut Oil cup Shea Butter1/3 cup light oil like almond, olive or jojoba10-30 drops of Peppermint (or other) essential oil for scentWhat to do:In a double boiler or glass bowl in hot water, combine all ingredients except essential oils. Bring to medium heat and stir constantly until all ingredients are melted.Remove from heat and let cool slightly.Move to fridge and let cool another 1 hour or until it starts to harden but is still somewhat soft. (this may take more or less time depending on the container it is in)Add the essential oil(s) of your choice and use a hand mixer to whip for 10 minutes until fluffy.  Return to fridge for 10-15 minutes to set.Store in a glass jar with a lid and use as you would regular lotion or body butter. If your home stays above 75 degrees, it may soften and need to be kept at the fridge, but it will stay whipped at a temperature lower than that.  Enjoy!",5
"Together, my husband and I have lost over 300 pounds combined. We have done this naturally by exercising and eating better. That said, we are always on the lookout for healthier alternatives to products. We recently decided to try out this coconut oil to use for cooking in place of regular oil because it had less calories and seemed to have more health benefits. We really enjoyed it. We used it to cook chicken in on the pan. It had an amazing smell while cooking, and a nice mild flavor. It was just a touch sweet, but not overpowering. It was a nice, thick consistency, so I am also planning on trying it on my skin as has been suggested for moisturizing. All in all, this is a great product and we plan on continuing to use coconot oil for cooking in place of regular canola or vegetable oil. This is a lot less greasy and tastier!",5
"I'm obsessed with coconut. And this oil just adds to my new life style. It is so tasty and very good quality. If you do not like the coconut smell/taste this is not for you. Since I love it, I will be buying more!!",5
Excellent taste and texture. We have started using coconut oil for its health benefits. Great for baking instead of using shortening.,5
Great Product with many uses!  Nice coconut smell.  Very happy with my purchase.  From personal care to cooking this product is a must.,5
Excellent product. Will do business again. Used to make homemade lip balm and lotion bars as gifts. Everyone loved them.,5
"I heard that coconut oil is good for skin and hair, so I thought I'd try it out.  We tried it as a hot oil treatment for our hair (brilliant!) and as a skin oil (luscious!)  It makes our hair look healthy and shiny and it makes my skin feel hydrated and soft.A couple of things to keep in mind though: a little goes a long way, I just dip my fingers into the tub and then rub it into my skin.  Same thing for the hair: just a little does it.  I put the tub into the hot bath to warm it up then just put a little on my fingertips and rub it into my clean scalp.  I let it sit in my hair for ten minutes or so, then wash it out.  IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO WASH IT OUT WITH SHAMPOO.  If you don't your hair will just look limp and greasy - not good.  You also want to wash down the tub or shower with a detergent or cleanser after you use the oil because it makes it very slick and dangerous.Originally we got the coconut oil for cooking and we just poured off a little into a small tupperware container, but now we use it in the bath more than in the kitchen so we've moved the whole tub to the bath and ordered a second one for the kitchen!",5
My wife is truly impressed with the quality of the product and the fast delivery made it even more so.  In fact she uses this instead of the other skin lotion she was using before.,5
"I was asked by Viva Labs to try this product for free, and I obliged. I've stayed away from coconut oil in the past because it is high in saturated fats, preferring olive oil generally. Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil gets brownie points, though, for being Organic.This coconut oil remains solid at room temperature and I've used it for a number of things, from baking to moisturizing my skin. My one complaint about using coconut oil vs. a regular skin moisturizer is that the smell and greasiness tend to linger longer.If you actually do want coconut oil, then I highly recommend this product. If you don't need it for something, you might want to skip it.",4
"The best I've had, and I agree it's #1.  So smooth, delicious, fresh and dissolves better than the rest of the top-rated brands.  Definitely worth the slightly higher price.  If I had to go back to the previous brands I've used, I'd be extremely disappointed.  I'm an avid bargain shopper, and I'm happy to spend a little more for such a superior product.  Thank you, Viva Labs!!",5
I have used coconut oil in the past as a hair treatment and did not like it at all. I was wary of trying coconut oil again actually because I didn't think there was a difference between the types. BOY WAS I WRONG.After receiving this item to test I wanted to use it as more than just a hair treatment. I know there are a myriad of uses for coconut oil so the first thing I did was cook with it. The aroma was light and it imparted a mild coconutty flavor (more nutty than the typical candy sweet coconut flavor). I used it to cook chicken it for a green curry sauce. It was the perfect addition. The food wasnt oily at all and there wasnt a strange artificial coconut aftertaste i've experience with other brands.Next I used it to make an organic lip scrub. I was worried that the coconut oil would taste overwhelming (as I actually don't like coconuts or coconut flavored anything). It wasnt overwhelming at all. I have to believe it is because it's organic and extra virgin.I am excited to continue to find more uses for this oil. It really has changed my view on coconut oil because before this I was anti coconut oil.AND THE PRICE IS WELL WORTH IT. 15 oz for less than $10?!?! I paid about $7 for a 5 ounce jar of sub par coconut oil.,5
"I was contacted by Viva Labs about a month ago and was asked to review this product. I received the coconut oil for free in exchange for my honest opinion in a review. My boyfriend and I have become healthy eaters and one of the big changes we made recently was to switch to cooking with coconut oil. We have tried about 3 different brands, this being the fourth, and this is by far my favorite. As the top reviewer on this product said, you open the container and immediately you can smell the difference. It actually smells like coconut! None of the other brands we have bought smell like coconut, and they were from Whole Foods! I have used this coconut oil both to saut vegetables and to bake with and it worked wonderfully. I baked pumpkin bread and it came out moist and delicious.I love that this coconut oil is organic and non-GMO. It is also still a great price even with those impressive labels. It does come in a plastic container but it is BPA free for those concerned. I am absolutely in love with this coconut oil and will be ordering from them from now on. Absolutely wonderful, quality product at a great price!",5
We love this oil! It has a great taste and price. Maybe it's just our imagination but it seems that our focus and concentration has improved since we've been taking a teaspoon a day. Anyway overall it has a long list of benefits and this one is easy to take.,5
"This is the first time I have tried this product. Really the first time I have used coconut oil period. I suffer from very dry skin and read some articles that said coconut oil was a great skin moisturizer. This stuff works well! A little greasy at first  but it does soak in . A little goes a long way. I love the idea that this is safe to use on even ""sensitive"" areas of the body. Great product , great price.",5
"This is my first time buying this product.  After reading the many positive reviews I went with this brand. I am very happy, the price and product.  I take one teaspoon a day with a little bit of royal jelly honey. I also use this as a moisturizer and use it on my hair.  Okay the hair part: it makes your hair so soft and adds a beautiful sheen to it. I cannot wait to read the other benefits of cocount oil.",5
this absorbs really quickly on my skin and does not leave me feeling greasy.  Also have used on my face and hair.,5
"This oil is the best we have used. We started using coconut oil just for popcorn. We loved the flavor and that is all we really ever thought of. However, with this oil, we loved the taste so much we have used it to cook vegetables and replace other fats in baking etc. The taste is really fabulous. The fact that it is such a pure product that is non-GMO is a plus.Viva labs extra virgin will replace the other oils we have been using!",5
"Smells delicious. You can use it for cooking, as a skin moisturizer, or to deep condition your hair. I use it on my hair and it does the job. Just remember that it is very oily as the name states. But you can always rub the excess onto your skin and it leaves it feeling soft.",5
"I use coconut oil for various aspects, including baking and cooking. Really enjoy the taste of ths product.  I use it for make-up remover and a moisturizer.  Great product?",5
Great stuff - high quality and tastes great!  Definitely a regular customer going forward and also great for oil pulling!,5
"This coconut oil is very good. I really enjoy the smell, taste and texture. Delicious! Would highly recommend this and encourage everyone to incorporate coconut oil in their culinary and beauty rituals. Read up on it, a PLETHORA of health benefits.",5
"Love this stuff! I have done extensive research on the health benefits, and I had wanted to incorporate an organic extra virgin coconut oil into my diet (according to health gurus organic/extra virgin is the ONLY type you should buy). Viva Labs has a wonderful mild flavor, is relatively inexpensive, and is 100% organic! I will definitely keep buying this product. In fact, I plan to buy a second container since I am using it in cooking as well as a moisturizer at night and need one in the kitchen and one in the bathroom!",5
"So delicious!  I ordered this coconut oil after reading about the incredible health benefits especially as it pertains to cognitive function and Alzheimer's prevention.  I put it in my chai tea, I use it to cook (gives amazing favor to Coconut Shrimp) and every once in a while just eat a spoonful.  I had read reviews about coconut oil upsetting peoples stomach, I frankly doubt that the oil was Viva.  Certified organic is not trivial and totally worth it!  We finished our first jar in under 2 weeks and opened our 2nd jar yesterday.",5
"I used this as a hair treatment, amazing results. follow instructions  on package  also good for skinGood Value for price",5
"I love this stuff!I've split my jar between the part I'm using for lotion, and the part for cooking.As a lotion- yes, it gets hard when the weather cools off... but that's when I need some serious moisture on my hands and elbows. This works wonderfully well, and smells gorgeous- like a Jimmy Buffet song! It reminds me that summer WILL come again.For cooking, it's also great. I've mostly used it when sauteing veg for curries, and it's ideal for that. The coconut scent adds a lot to the dish.I am starting to experiment with using it as a substitute for lard in some piecrusts. It's got a strong coconut presence, so it's not suitable for everything... but where it is- like in fruit pies, or curry-flavored savory pies, I'm hoping it will work well. I've got some portions frozen to try this out. I think it'd be brilliant in a key lime pie, for instance!I'm also planning to make some fancier lotion with this oil and the beeswax I get from our beehives.Viva Labs did send me a pound of this to test, and I fell in love- I've tried other coconut oils in the past few years, and like this one the best.",5
"We found the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to be an extremely high quality product. I have to admit, I didn't realize everything you could do with coconut oil.  It can be used for cooking, for skin care and even for your hair. Personally, I'm not into it for skin and hair, but my wife and daughter like it for those purposes.  They used it for skin and dry lips as well as for a hair treatment.I like the smell and taste of the coconut oil, and I like that it is organic and free of trans fats. While the package also states it can be taken as a supplement (1-4 tablespoons a day), I have not used it this way, and don't really plan to.  It is fat after all, and thus high in calories. But to supplement this fat, for other fats, that makes sense.While it is called coconut oil, it comes solid, not liquid. However, it doesn't take that much to heat it to liquid, you can use hot water to turn it to liquid form.Bottom line, if you are looking for a high quality organic coconut oil, look no farther than this excellent product from Viva Labs.",5
"I was contacted to review Viva Labs Coconut Oil. I wondered if maybe they knew I had Health-Crazy relatives?  0.o  Probably not.  Nor were they aware of my... um... country view of healthy products. I figured they were joking, so I said, ""sure!""  When this reserved-looking container arrived for my reviewing, I was pleasantly surprised.Although I haven't products if they're not produced by a writer before, I will review any & every product if they're anything like this one. Please.My first impression is of climbing inside a fresh coconut.My second impression is also of climbing inside a fresh coconut. I don't think I did anything for half an hour of blogging besides stick my nose back inside the container, even though I left it open and the kids wandered out to see what smelled so great. Like I had a new air freshener, or something. Sitting next to the open container was not enough, though, 'cause I was instantly addicted to sticking my nose inside and inhaling deeply. OMG.  It smells better than a coconut at the store... it's like a coconut IN the tropics.My healthy relative dropped in and was instantly envious (of which I took advantage, of course.) She suggested that I use a couple tablespoons in the smoothies I make for the kids. That the coconut oil would be perfect for adding creaminess to raw food smoothies or ice cream. I pointed out that although it smelled like tropical heaven, there was no taste to the oil. She said that was good. Then she made sure it was organic and cold pressed and was surprised that it recommended cooking with it.  (She's a fan of raw.)So I thought about what I could fry up with it.  :-DI make waffles on weekends for my family and they always want crispy ones, but I hate slathering oil on my waffle-maker and butter... it's tasty, but doesn't make crispy waffles. The coconut oil is my new fav thing to make waffles with. Just takes a bit and makes perfect waffles every time.Yea, that's probably not what the person who contacted me had in mind as a ""review"", but it's real. Waffles and smoothies.  Great raw, great cooked... shiny in the hair (it said ""skin & hair care"", so hey, we tried it!) but my favorite is how heavenly it smells.",5
"The oil seems to be  absorbed by my skin. It makes it feel nice, and it smells good.  Will try it on my hair next.",5
"It's hard to roam anywhere on the internet anymore without seeing the beneficial qualities of coconut oil.  It's been heralded as the cure all for everything.  From food, to hair care, to skin care, it's used for just about everything.  And there's been a bunch of brands that have popped up as a result of this craze.  But Viva Labs seems to be doing it right.Viva Labs is non-GMO, organic, extra-virgin and a bunch of other good things.  It's free of pesticides and is suitable for vegans.  In a 1 TB serving there are 30 calories and 14 grams of fat.  It is definitely suitable for eating and for skin care as well.  It has a great scent, you feel like you're in the tropics as soon as you open it up.  But the taste is very light and neutral and not over powering with the taste of coconut.  It does tend to harden up when left on the pantry shelf though, but as soon as it comes in contact with heat from a pan or body heat though, it melts quickly.I've used this in baking (and tried a little on it's own).  It worked great as a replacement for butter in baked goods and gave it a little bit of a tropical taste.  The texture of the baked items was a little oilier than normal.  It didn't have any impact on the rest of the flavor or enjoyment, but was a little surprising.  I haven't tried frying with this product yet, but can imagine it would be just fine for that use as well.As a hair/skin care product it works well.  I used some as lotion and it smelled wonderful going on and made my skin nice and smooth.  It did feel a little greasy, but no worse than some of the conventional lotions out there.  And hair care, I spread a tbsp over my scalp and rubbed in.  It formed a hard crust, but later, after two shampoos, it left my hair nice and soft.This is a good product.  I'm definitely going to keep using it both for cooking and body care.**This product was received as a free sample from the manufacturer.Review by M. Reynard 2013",4
I love coconut oil for not only cooking but as a body and hair lotion and many other uses. This brand has a really great and light coconut smell that I am surprised is missing in some other brands.,5
"I have been using this for a while and I really love it. Previously, I had not used coconut oil as a beauty product. I had only used it for cooking. This time, I decided to explore the other benefits coconut oil has to offer.My favorite thing, so far, has been smoothing this onto my legs after a hot shower and shaving. My skin absorbs the oil and becomes silky smooth. I love that this oil doesn't leave a sticky or filmy residue. It doesn't sit on top of my skin and it's not greasy. If it gets under my fingernails, the heat from my skin pretty much melts and absorbs it, unlike with lotion.I tried to use this on my face as well, but didn't really care much for that. I do like using it on my legs and arms though. I also plan to incorporate this into a home made lip balm recipe. I think it will really add to the texture and scent.",5
Loved it. As soon as you open it you can smell the coconut flavor. Definitely worth your money. Would definitely recommend,5
"i love coconut smell and this product is sooooo amazing. it can be used to cook, and remove make up and moisturize my skin especially winter is here but one thing is that i watched a tutorial in youtube to use this do my hair overnight, but i don't it work so well but it may because of time i will try at least once a month to see how this works for improving my hair condition.",5
"I was introduced to this product and had no idea that Coconut Oil could be so diverse. It does taste very good and it is an excellent moisturizer. You can also use it for cooking and for your hair, but I have used it for a healthy supplement and for a moisturizer. I use a lot of hand sanitizer due to working with a lot of people which dries out your hands. Coconut Oil more than provides the moisturizer I need. The plastic canister it comes in is top quality as well so you can take it anywhere and know it is sealed and safe. Great product, and besides, how cool is it that you can eat it, cook with it and use it to alleviate dry skin!!",5
"I've been a long time user of Nutiva, and prefer it over all other brands. Until I tried this one! Now, you'd think coconut oil is coconut oil. You squeeze a coconut, you get out oil. You package it, and you sell it, it's all just oil, so why bother paying more for one vs. the other. But this coconut oil tastes better to me. It's hard to quantify it, but if you try it, you'll see what I mean. It's delicious! I won't go into all of the health benefits of coconut oil, and all of the wonderful uses. I'm sure others will go on about that. But try this, at least once, and I think you'll be very pleased! Now if I could just get a good full-fat coconut milk...",5
"I've used several brands of coconut oils in the past, and this is by far my favorite.  It is USDA certified organic and non-GMO.  It is also extra virgin and cold pressed.  The aroma is magnificent, although it doesn't leave a strong coconut taste on your food.  I've used it to cook with and on my skin (and my daughter's) to moisturize, but not in my hair.  The few negative reviews are, in my opinion, unfair because they are complaints about coconut oil themselves, not about this actual product.  Coconut oil is solid at room temperature...it is liquid at 75ish degrees.  This is all coconut oil.  It is made of coconuts...so it smells like coconuts. This brand really is one of the better ones I've tried that is currently on the market.",5
"I've never been a coconut fan so it surprises me that I love coconut oil so very much.Not all coconut oils are the same. There are differing methods and treatments and grades.You can find cheaper grades that are heat treated. Folks who want less coconut taste can find a product that doesn't leave behind a subtle flavor. But that process involves one more step in processing.  I appreciate companies like Viva Labs who offer organic (guaranteeing that it is GMO free, too) product. This product is extra virgin and cold pressed so is as close to the naturally occurring state of the coconut as possible.I don't take spoonfuls of coconut daily to absorb the nutritional aspects. However, a good friend swears that doing just that diminishes symptoms of colds etc and helps decrease the time span of illness. My favorite uses for coconut oil, and I found the Viva Labs one to be perfect for me, is in baking and cooking. There is no better treat than popcorn popped in coconut oil. I just melt a thin layer of coconut oil in the bottom of a dutch oven or popcorn pan, toss in a single layer of popcorn kernels when the oil is hot, pop it, and salt it. Coconut oil pie crust is delicious and coconut oil substituted for butter adds another layer of tastiness in my baked goods.The consistency of the Viva Labs Coconut Oil is consistent and easy to work with. I've used other brands that are hard to dig out in cold months, very hard. So four months a year, this can be annoying.Viva Labs Organic Coconut oil is also a great skin and hair conditioner and moisturizer. It takes a few minutes for it to absorb but is very softening and smells terrific. My daughter's dogs love coconut oil and when I open the jar they'll be right there trying to snag any I might be sampling. My cat loves it as well. So it makes for a nice animal treat, too. And oil is good for animal coats and helps cats with hair ball reduction.If you haven't tried coconut oil, you might want to start with Viva Labs perfect sized container. I appreciate that the sample I received to try out.",5
"I have never used coconut oil before, and when I was given the chance to try some, I read about it and found it had many uses, some of which were very interesting to me. I like to use natural products and I have found that good quality natural substances can be quite useful.Coconut oil has many uses, and the Viva Labs Coconut Oil has several listed on the container for nutritional supplementation, cooking, skin care, and hair care.The nutrition of coconut oil varies, depending on how it is prepared. Oils (of all kinds) are commonly adulterated and chemically altered, which has an often very negative effect on the oil. Viva Labs fortunately is offering extra virgin, cold pressed, organic oil.The fact that coconut oil is frequently solid means that the container must be designed to accommodate a substance which is liquid and solid at temperatures in which it may be stored.Now, for my uses of it:I have an occasional flareup of atopic dermatitis. While it isn't major and doesn't last a long time, it comes and goes, and nothing I've tried helped with it, so I had just accepted it as a part of life. However, when it occurred recently, I put a little of Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil on the affected skin, and despite it being of normal severity, it cleared up very quickly. So little coconut oil had an apparently large effect. It has always been solid in the container while I've had it, so to use it, I take a few flakes of it, hold it between my fingers, and then rub it into the affected skin. It has a pleasant scent, and the oil is absorbed quickly.If only for this, I will be keeping a container on hand.The nutritional aspect is also interesting to me, as I am often wanting higher calorie foods without resorting to processed food and added sugars. I've tried this with brown rice, and I must say, it is wonderful. I cooked the rice (actually...microwave in a bag, not the best rice experience, but a fast one), and added the (solid) oil on top and mixed it in. The taste was not strong, but it greatly improved the taste and texture of the microwaved rice. I added too much I think, as the rice was extremely filling before I finished, but this is a great way to add fats and calories to a meal.Nutritionally, coconut oil is (obviously) almost pure fat, and mostly saturated fats. While this may be undesirable for many, it is a great benefit to those who require more calories. I learned of adding it to rice from an athletic trainer with similar training goals as me. Also, it may be very good for those who do not need more calories, but would like to replace less desirable sources of fats in their diet and cooking.In conclusion, I would buy this when my current supply runs out, and I recommend it to others looking for a good source of coconut oil.",5
I've used this on my hair and skin so far.  It works wonders in my curly hair and of course it smells wonderful..  A little bit goes a long way so this tub will last months.,5
"I don't use this product for cooking, but I do use it as a skin moisturizing cream and lip balm. It has no odor or taste. It lasts a long time on the skin without being oily. I really like the way it makes my skin feel. I'm 63 years old and have a very smooth face due in great part to this product. I don't take it internally, although the instructions say it can be taken that way.I like it and recommend it!",4
"I use it in everything! Straight for a supplement, in cooking, in smoothies...and directly on skin for healing. There are over 100 uses for coconut oil, that I cannot begin to list all of them.I am very impressed! It dissolves quickly and easily, there is no bad aftertaste at all, and it smells good in the jar. This Brand offers thee best coconut oil!! I highly recommend",5
I love using coconut oil in my cooking but had not tried it for skincare. For either use I want the purest coconut oil that I can get and this Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil fits the bill. I love that it is USDA Organic and Non GMO Project verified. It is cold-pressed and the only ingredient on the label is pure coconut oil.Opening the container is like being whisked away to a tropical island as the scent of coconut fills the air. Because this is unrefined it does have a coconut scent and taste. (Pancakes made with pure coconut oil taste heavenly!) The coconut oil is very white when solid but liquefies easily when warmed.My youngest has eczema so we try to lotion her up as soon as she finishes a bath to lock the moisture into her skin. Many lotions that we tried seemed to irritate her skin even more so we were buying a special eczema cream. When I received this coconut oil I decided to try it as it would be more pure than anything else we had tried. I simply put the jar on the bathroom counter and it warmed up while she took her bath. After patting her dry I would rub the coconut oil on her skin which aided in holding moisture in her skin and replacing oil that had been washed from her skin in the bath. The coconut oil absorbed quickly and did not leave her greasy or slippery (very important when the toddler is trying to escape pajama time!). As long as I made sure the coconut oil had absorbed before getting her dressed I didn't notice any stains on her pajamas. I am very pleased with this coconut oil for skin care and will continue to use it with my daughter as I know the upcoming winter season will be very difficult for her skin.I will also be purchasing a jar for my kitchen when my current coconut oil runs out.,5
"When I first heard of the claims for this Coconut Oil it sounded like a Saturday Night Live skit to me... ""It's a cooking oil"", "" No, it's a skin cream"", ""No, it's a hair treatment"" I can just hear Chevy Chase holding up the jar and saying ""Relax, it's all three, a skin cream, a cooking oil AND a hair treatment.""Well seriously, it can be used for all of these things... and also as a daily nutritional supplement plus proabably a few more things. As for me personally, I think that after using this product for over a month in a variety of recipies that I prefer to use it strictly for cooking and as an occasional nutritional supplement. Although it is very smoothing on the skin, I don't care for it as much as a more mainstream skin lotion.Opening and sniffing was the first sign that I might actually using this for cooking. It had such a fresh yet not ovewhelming coconut smell. I mean if you don't like coconut you won't care for this, but assuming you do like coconut on some level, this is a really nice smell. It's a very light tasting oil and leaves almost no oily residue on your palate. Depending on what you're cooking or frying, it does impart a coconut flavor but that's not a bad thing. I mean that's why I would use it for some recipes.This particular coconut oil is also Organic and Extra Virgin. Good qualities. I even went to a large Big Box Membership Discount store and purchased their big container of coconut oil.. didn't compare at all to this Viva Labs Coconut Oil.So I'm convinced this is a great oil to use in many cooking situations. It's more pricey than your basic vegetable, canola or peanut oil but it's healthier and different in a good way. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this coconut oil. A sample of it was provided to me for testing and review.",5
For a long time the main oil my wife and I used in the kitchen was olive oil or butter. In the last year or so we've started using coconut oil more and we've been really pleased with this one in particular.Viva Labs' Coconut Oil has a great flavor and works really well for everything from frying to baking to smoothies.The taste of different coconut oils varies pretty greatly. Sometimes you can barely taste the coconut and other times it's so strong it overwhelms whatever you're cooking in it. I've found this one to be just right and have been really happy with it.,5
I was sent this oil for review.  I has planned to save it for the summer because I love using coconut oil on my hair in the summer.  But I'm using it instead for oil-pulling and it is excellent for this purpose! The taste and texture are light.  I highly recommend it.,5
"The first time I used Viva Labs Coconut Oil in place of my regular moisturizer I was a little hesitant. I was going to meet a friend for lunch that day and I was TERRIFIED I'd smell like I just left the Caribbean. I needn't have worried. While coconut oil smells absolutely amazing in the jar, the scent fades pretty much as soon as it is applied.Applying lotion every morning is a pretty ho-hum activity in my book. I generally rush through it, but since I've been using coconut oil I actually enjoy my morning moisturizing routine. It doesn't take much longer to apply, but I think the subtle scent and the fact that it's oil just makes my routine feel a little more... luxe. Coconut oil goes on easily and absorbs quickly and I feel like it does a better job of keeping my skin moisturized throughout the day than a traditional lotion. I can definitely feel the difference with my skin when I apply coconut oil than when I apply lotion, because when I apply lotion I always feel like I need to reapply a few hours later (especially this time of year). I really like using coconut oil and I'm glad I gave it a shot because by skin feels better than ever! However, I'm not sure what I'll do next summer as there's no SPF in coconut oil.I like that Viva Labs Coconut Oil is 100% organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed coconut oil. There are no additional ingredients. I often use coconut oil for cooking, and I love what it does for my skin now, too!If you haven't used coconut oil in the past it is worth noting that coconut oil solidifies at around 76 degrees. I generally stick my container of oil in the microwave for 25 seconds to bring it back to a liquid state (the oil does not get hot).",5
"I love all things coconut and Viva Coconut Oil does not disappoint. It remained soft in warm weather and only hardened once the weather turned colder but a few minutes by a warm stove and it is soft enough to use without a problem. I use it on my hands & feet to keep them supple, on the ends of my hair, and as a supplement.  I like the taste and smell and how light and smooth it is. I definitely recommend this product.",5
"At first I was skeptical when I read the label, which read ""...a healthy addition to your daily life through your dietary supplementation, cooking, and beauty care."" Such a claim reminded me of the old SNL Commercial Parodies, where Gilda Radner and Dan Ackroyd were arguing about a product named Shimmer: ""No, it's a floor wax. No, it's a dessert topping!"" and then Chevy Chase's announcer voice broke in, assuring them Shimmer was BOTH, claiming Shimmer guaranteed ""...the greatest shine you ever tasted!""Humor aside, the question my skeptical family asked was, does Viva Labs' Coconut Oil work? The short answer: YES.When I opened up the jar, I was struck at first by its solidity: while the oil glistened and had tiny glistening ""beads"" upon it, it was very intact and solid, with no product displacement or viscous or watery mixture which might have indicated either a poor mixing or a breaking down of its chemistry. The coconut oil was exactly the composition you'd want to see.Secondly, it did not give off a strong scent of coconut(though I admit I don't have the world's best sense of smell). While I would have been pleased if it did, I think that could be detrimental if it is indeed used for other than food: some people are not in love with the scent when it comes to skin care or the other uses it might be put to.When we rubbed it on our skin, my daughter was first to comment how it really glistened. It was slow to soak in, too, which soon bothered my daughter (who's not a big coconut fan anyway): she felt that it was too thick and oily, and continued to leave her skin with a ""waxy"" feeling. In fact, she felt uncomfortable enough with it that she felt she had to wash it off, complaining that THAT was hard to do...it resisted the soap and did not come off easily..However, my wife and I left ours on, and we were quite pleased with its staying power. We do a lot of work outside regardless of the season, and we were tired of creams that were so quickly absorbed they lacked any staying power.  My hands can get very rough, and I hate wispy little creams whose primary ingredient seems to be water. Not so with the coconut oil: twenty minutes later, I still felt the cream's presence on my hands...not the sticky stuff, just the moistener. And an hour after that I feel my hands are still smoother than normal.As for the taste, we tried it on toast and were very surprised and enthused by it: there was no strong coconut taste, but rather a light and pleasant flavor with just a hint of sweetness and coconut. We had thought it might be overpowering, like a Crisco oil, but instead its taste complemented the toast and did not dominate. Both my wife and I were extremely pleased.Additionally, we used the cream to make up a nice syrupy hard shell concoction for ice cream, like Smucker's Magic Shell, and it was delicious. [Magic Shell is the brand name of a chocolate syrup that hardens when it is placed on cold surfaces, like ice cream. It can be reproduced quite well by using a variety of recipes on the internet...check through Google.] It had a nice coconut-y flavor without being either too cloying or too weak, and mixed in with the chocolate really well, resulting in a nice even mixture. As there were only two ingredients (the other being chocolate) this is a good indication.We also used it to coat casserole dishes and have been quite pleased with it there also.Now, I cannot  speak as to ability to do more utilitarian tasks, such as lubricating new baseball gloves - or, as Chevy Chase claimed, to provide a better floor wax - but I have been very pleased with it thus far. We did used it as an ingredient in place of butter in a vegetable-based dish and were very pleased with it. Given its successes, I intend to pop popcorn with it, use it for stir-fry, and so on.One final note: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.",5
"They sent me one to try it, and we liked it. Taste is good, texture is good. Seems of high quality.",5
"I use coconut oil for lots of purposes, including cooking, in smoothies and other recipes, in my homemade tooth ""soap"" and others. My daughter uses it to condition her horse's tail. (Though I probably wouldn't use organic for that.!)I was sent a sample to try and I find the quality to be excellent. I've used a variety of brands, and I would say this one is up there in terms of quality. The price is a little on the high side, but for organic and non-GMO it may be worth it. It definitely makes me feel comfortable that I am getting a product that is safe to use in my food.",5
"I've never tried coconut oil before so I can't really compare it this brand to a different one. However, I really enjoyed this. I used this coconut oil in cooking. I even used it when making popcorn and added a tiny bit of sugar and it wound up tasting a lot like kettle corn. I also used it as part of my beauty regiment by making an under eye cream out of it.If you don't like coconuts then this product wouldn't be for you. It not only smells like coconuts but it also tastes like them. I love coconuts so I had no problem with the smell. In fact, I even tried a tiny bit on spoon before using it to see what it tasted like and it was surprisingly good. And I don't make a habit of eating oil out of a spoon. This may be the first time that I've used coconut oil but this is definitely now a permanent staple in our house.",5
"Love this Oil. I use it to cook with, I mix it with shea butter for my skin and hair. We melt it and put it on popcorn instead of butter. I've read wonderful reports about the health benefits of consuming coconut oil and try to take a minimum of 4 teaspoons a day. At first the coconut smell was different (on popcorn for instance) but I got used to and and now I love it. It's an acquired liking I reckon. Anyway, I can't recommend it enough.",5
"We use the Viva Labs Coconut Oil primarily for cooking. The taste is mild and a little ""nutty"" but really quite good. I know coconut oil is supposed to be a healthy alternative to other oils as the structure of the fats is more healthy, but we enjoy the taste more than anything. Highly recommended!",5
"I am VERY picky when it comes to coconut oil. I used this product for two things.First i use it nightly on my face and under my eyes, any dry spots on my skin, arms kegs, get it too it is AMAZING. Its not greasy like you would think, it absorbs wonderfully. Second i have been a professional soap maker for over 15 years and have used many coconut oil brands but THIS ine i love, i just wish they offered it in MUCH larger containers as i use about 30 ounces A day as i pour commercially, please fix that! I love your product!Its the BEST as a wrinkle remover and thats NO joke.",5
"A very versatile product.  I can only speak for the cooking part since I haven't ventured into using it as body lotion or others.Unlike other oils which can be used almost to cook everything, this one has a stronger taste that could be used to your advantage, in specific dishes.  I would recommend it to fry: breaded shrimp, rice, celery-carrot frittatas, bananas, but you can get creative and create your own dishes.I would definitively recommend it if you want to try healthy choices for cooking.",5
"This coconut oil is an excellent choice for someone looking for non gmo and organic. Coconut oil is an excellent choice for not only cooking, but also skin care and hair care. It has anti-fungal properties which make it an excellent choice for treating certain skin conditions. Coconut oil is one of those oils that in it's virgin state is solid at 76 degrees and anything above that it is liquid so in summer months be mindful that it will be liquid when you open it and when you open it in the winter months it will be hard and solid but is easily made liquid by warming a bit in a bowl of very warm water or just sit it in a warm place.It's also good for oil pulling which removes toxins from the body and improves overall oral health so enjoy your health!",4
"I used to cook with olive oil until I learned that heat destroys most everything good about it. I still use it on salads, or maybe I'll add it to a hot dish when serving it, but for the most part I've turned to coconut oil.I've tried several brands. None has been unsatisfactory but some are better than others.I like that the plastic tub on this Viva labs product is designed for easy dispensing. Other brands of coconut oil have used more narrow or deep containers that make it more difficult to retrieve the product, especially in the colder months (which tends to harden the coconut oil). We've had some chilly nights recently, and still this product has remained pliable at room temperature.I have used the product on my hair to great result. I also took a small container along with me to Southern Turkey, for keeping my arms and legs moisturized amid the Mediterranean sun. I found it a great emollient -- moisturizes without being greasy. (I did add a bit of essential oil; the coconut smell is not overly strong, and it wears off quickly, but I didn't want to risk being mistaken for a pina colada.)I also use it instead of butter in various baked items. Lower burning point and healthier.",5
"I was provided with a free sample of this product with the understanding that I would write an honest review.Attention: While I understand that this product can be used for cooking as well, this review pertains only to Coconut Oil as a beauty product.Indeed, I have used this product to moisturize my skin. It works wonderfully and does not leave a sticky residue. However, even more superior is its usage for hair care. During my younger years I was blessed with wonderful hair, which fell in natural waves by itself (photo model style) without too much care. Unfortunately, as I grew older, the gradual and eventually dominant appearance of gray hair changed all that. Hair dye made my hair frizzy. In order to keep this frizz out I constantly had to wash and blow-dry my shoulder long hair, pretty much every day. Though I experimented much, for the last ten years I could not find a single product, which would do the trick (including the famous Argan oil, which did nothing for my hair). This Coco-Nut oil does the trick. Once a week I massaged it into my hair, waited for about two hours and washed and blow dried my hair as always. The result  No frizz for three to four days! The results are so convincing, that I will not use this Coconut Oil for any other purpose. Additionally my hair is extremely manageable, shines with a healthy glow, the color is more vibrant, and there is no need to wash every day. My hair now looks like my hair looked when I was twenty.I am more than pleased and will use this product from now on for my hair care, always.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger",5
"Full Disclosure: I received a sample at no charge (and no strings attached) from Viva.When I first received the sample, I wasn't finished using the Coconut Oil I usually buy (from a brand name organic grocery retailer), so I paid extra close attention as I was using it so I could compare.  When I started using Viva, I was struck by how great it smelled.  Very fragrant and fresh; this shows up in the foods cooked with it, so if you think you don't want a little coconut fragrance, you might want to substitute it with something else.  That said, it tasted GREAT when I cooked with it.  So good, that I have started spreading it on bread or crackers as a snack.  I've also enjoyed it greatly when blended into hot coffee with a little butter (""Bulletproof Coffee"" or similar).  The price is good as well.  I'm switching over to Viva.",5
"I usually purchase Nutivia and use coconut oil for skin and hair care. I do not use it for cooking.The ingredients are identical. Viva Organics has a mention of trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts included in their ingredients. This is not present on Nutiva's ingredient list.At room temperature in my home (about 76 degrees) both are fairly firm in the containers. When I pult them into small plastic jars, they are both the same color. Nutiva is significantly lumpier (even prior to removing it from the jar). That being said, both melt quickly in my hands and on the skin.Currently, Viva Labs is priced better on Amazon (Significantly so). So for now, it's the winner for me.",5
"I am a big fan of coconut oil. This is the 4th or 5th brand of coconut oil that I've brought into my house, and I've been on a coconut oil high for about 3 years now. Happy to report that it passes the test. In full disclosure, I should add that the company asked me to review their product but in all honesty it is a good, high quality coconut oil.  My favorite thing is that it's organic. It has a faint smell and taste of coconut, and that's okay with me because it's not too strong. I use it for cooking, skin care and hair care. I would highly recommend this brand of coconut oil.",5
"I am a fan of using coconut oil for cooking and baking.  Most of the coconut oil that Ive used in the past has been odorless and flavorless--the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil does smell and taste like coconut.  If you enjoy coconut--it's a great mildly, flavored oil option.  While reviewing, I also tried it as a moisturizer.  My middle daughter preferred the scent of it over perfumed lotions and creams--and it did help moisturize her skin.  The same daughter found that coconut oil helped her manage her dry curly hair as well.  I preferred it for cooking--but, my daughters preferred it as additions to their skin and hair routines.We found that the product remained a soft solid at room temperature in our home (around 73 degrees) and had a slight coconut scent and flavor.  It was nice to note that it is not only organic and GMO free--but the packaging is BPA free too.  I would recommend it as a health and beauty product and as a supplement--or for use in recipes where the coconut flavor complements the ingredients.I did receive a sample of this product from the manufacturer to review on my blog--but, my opinions and experiences are my own.",4
"I use this product for skin care primarily.  As a diabetic I have a lot of problems with dry skin on my legs and the itching drives me nuts to the point where I will scratch and cause bleeding!  I tried Viva Labs Extra Virgin Coconut oil and it does a wonderful job of relieving the dry skin and itch!  Not only that but I like the smell too!Just an aside, try coconut oil for poping popcorn, it works great and delivers great flavor!",5
"I, like several others, received a complementary jar in order to provide my opinion.  I will start by saying to those not familiar with this type oil, it could be a solid or liquid depending on the ambient temperature.  When it arrived, I was not aware of this and tilted the jar when opening and dumped some out on the counter.  After a few days, it solidified.I have used it for cooking and it provides a great alternative to butter or other types of oils.  I especially like the subtle flavor and aroma it adds.  Where I think it shines is in applications where you need to ""grease the pan"", the consistency allows you to use this healthy oil as a substitute to butter or shortening.While I do like the product, I don't find myself using it as often as olive oil for my day in and day out uses, but that does not reflect on its quality.  Its just what I'm used to, but I will definitely be using this more often when baking.",5
"I Really Love this Product.I have been looking for a Organic CoconutOil that not only was good but smelledlike coconut and this product do.It smells so Goood!I use it on my Hair, Body and as a Daily Supplement.If you are looking for a great coconut Oilyou will be so happy you purchased this product!Here is my Video Review also:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64clPgPkTBc",5
"Like a lot of people, I want easy healthy alternatives.  Coconut oil is one of those easy picks for me and Viva is a great choice.I mainly use coconut oil in cooking as a substitution to other, less healthy, oils and butter.  This product melts easily, with no strange taste or smell.  Seriously, you won't miss your vegie or olive oils. At all.On top of its kitchen uses it is a wonderful beauty product.  My husband is in construction and always has dry skin from working in the elements.  He's been using it as a skin lotion and it has done wonders. Bye, bye chapped skin!I've also been using it as an eye makeup remover. Did you know you could use it for that? Yep! So much better than the oil based, greasy products I've used in the past and leaves my skin feel so soft.Being organic and a great price are just another of the added bonuses to this product.I highly recommend!",5
"I use A LOT of coconut oil, and this coconut oil was just as good as any of the various organic brands I have tried.",5
"Hi All,I was contacted by Viva Labs to see if I'd like to try their product for free as they had seen me order other ""healthy living"" type products on Amazon.  I will say I have never used coconut oil before but have wanted to so thought this was a good opportunity.  I really like it.  I had family over for dinner the first time I used it... sauteed green beans were yummy and I also made brownies with it.  You could actually taste a hint of coconut.  My brother-in-law who is a big fan of coconut oil said he really liked the taste of it and was thinking about getting some of this brand.",5
"So my grandmother has been on me to try out coconut oil. She eats a tablespoon of it daily to help keep her ""regular"". She always boasted of its many uses. So I did some research and was intrigued by it's many uses and that it is an all-natural product. This stuff is great! It's hard in form in the tub it comes in but as you scoop it out it becomes softer. I use it to moisturize my feet (especially in the winter). I put some in the ends of my hair at night while I am watching TV, brush it through, go to sleep, wake up and shower using shampoo and conditioner. It adds much needed moisture to my ends! I use it when cooking. A little in the pan adds a nice light coconut flavor. The other day I tried some on my chapped lips and it worked great, smelt great too! This sits out and gets alot of use. I will be needing more soon. I know there are even more uses for it but this is what I have been using it for so far and find its well worth the price.",5
"I purchased this product as a sexual lubricant. After seeing tons of reviews online about how well coconut oil works for such purposes I decided I would explore. I received the product and it's amazing! OMG! It feels like velvety, I compared it to my water based lube and I always liked that, its done the job and it safe with toys, but the coconut oil is something else. When you rub it between your fingers you can definitely tell a difference, its a lot more natural. It even works with your silicone toys! So I recommend this to anyone looking into this product for things other than your hair or sauteing your vegetables. :D",5
"We have used this oil for a couple of weeks to cook with and enjoyed the nutty taste it added to our food. In a yellow cake it gave a nice hit of coconut taste when we used it as a substitute for the oil called for by the mix.Yesterday, I had a physical and checked with our MD about what she thought of using coconut oil as a substitute for other oils and she said it was an excellent choice for healthy eating, so we will be using more of it in the future.I was supplied a sample form the manufacture to sample and now will be switching to using it as much as possible in the future.",5
"I originally accepted a sample of this Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to try in some recipes for sauteed foods. But when I opened the jar, the smell of the coconut oil was so fresh and fragrant (I love coconut!) that my first thought was to try some on my face. It's been so dry with the heat on in the house now that the weather is colder and my skin feels dry. It really made my skin feel soft and moist, and even though it's oil, quite a bit of it seemed to be absorbed right away and some stayed around for up to an hour before soaking in. It didn't irritate my skin, it just felt really good. Because this coconut oil is certified organic and GMO free I don't have to worry about any chemicals or additives. It's just pure coconut oil. I do worry about some of the ingredients in the commercial face moisturizers that I use and wonder what the long term effects might be. Coconut oil, especially this organic one, is just a pure and simple product.This works as an excellent hair moisturizing treatment. I just scooped some from the jar and rubbed it in my hands and then applied it to my hair and scalp. (It smells wonderful!) I used enough to coat the strands pretty well. I left it on overnight and slept with a towel on my pillow. The next morning I shampooed my hair and blow dried it as usual. It made my hair so soft and shiny! I have fine textured, fly-away hair and I was afraid that it might leave it too oily, but it washed out easily and left it with a lot more body than it had before. I think I will continue doing this every week or two because it worked so well.So even though this coconut oil is going to be used primarily as a skin and hair product, there is plenty in this 15 ounce container, so I had to try it to saute some vegetables. It only takes a small amount and produces a nice nutty flavor. You have to be a little bit careful with the heat, much as you would with other pure oils like olive or seasame because it has a smoke point of around 350 and you don't want to compromise the flavor. It tasted especially good with asparagus and with fresh green beans. I also used it in a Lemongrass Chicken recipe that turned out very well.This is a product that I will purchase when this container is gone because I like the idea that it's a pure organic product and that it's GMO free. And I love the way it feels on my skin!",5
I have tried all kinds of coconut oils - mostly for cooking and personal care - and this is DEFINITELY my favorite. The tub it comes in is a nice size too. It has worked especially well for my young son's eczema.,5
"I was sent a complimentary jar of this coconut oil from the manufacturer to try out.  I used it for both my skin (it makes a great moisturizer) as well as cooking.  I made chewy coconut oil cookies with it. The product melted well in the microwave and produced a flavorful cookie reminiscent of coconut, but without an overwhelming coconutty flavor or smell.  If you need smaller amounts of coconut oil, I recommend this product. The wider jar also makes it easy to remove what you need as opposed to using a glass mason-type jar like some products.",5
"I do not cook very often, so I only tried this once as a cooking oil, frying shrimp in it for coconut shrimp.  It worked just like regular cooking oil, except it provided a slight coconut flavor.I did use the oil more for the family's beauty regiments than I did for cooking.First, my teenage daughter used it in her hair as a moisturizer.  She has really curly hair that tends to get frizzy and wanted something different than her usual product, which had stopped working and are ungodly expensive.  She put this on her hair about halfway down from the roots to the ends and left it on for 30 minutes. After she rinsed it out, she washed her hair, because it is an oil and does leave an oily residue.  Her hair was very soft and conditioned, although the product left no scent.  She really recommends it.She also uses it as a leg moisturizer, after shaving. She says it keeps her legs very soft, but the smell does not remain on her legs after like some lotions or oils.  (Which is fine with me, because no one really should be smelling her legs.)My pre-teen daughter also tried this product on her hair. Her hair is long and straight, with a little wave and also tends to get frizzy.  Unfortunately, she made the mistake of putting the oil all the way into her roots. The problem with this is that this oil is liquid in the container, but dries hard, almost like a wax. She has seasonal mild eczema on her scalp and having the waxy substance was not a big help. It did work on the rest of her hair, leaving it soft and with noticeably less frizz, but it was difficult to rinse out of her roots.Finally, I used it on the dog's skin.  The dog has a flea allergy and scratches herself raw.  I have tried other types of oils on her skin, but was hesitant to use anything other than olive oil or vegetable oil because the dogs licks it, and I don't want the scents making her ill.  This oil moisturized her dry, scaly skin just as well as other oils, but I didn't have to worry about her licking it off. She also seemed to like the flavor.  It did tend to dry hard and waxy, as it did in my younger daughter's hair, but the dog's is dry and flaky anyway, so it wasn't a big deal.  (We just needed to brush her a little bit more than normal.)All in all, I would recommend this product.",5
"I've used this product for one month. It is a wonderful product for a multitude of uses. When I first received it I placed half in another jar for cooking and left half in the original jar for my bathroom. It is a solid and did not melt until I had the oil in my hands.In the kitchen the coconut oil is great for baking, frying, and as a coffee creamer. The oil lends a slight fragrance of coconut which is particularly delicious with baked items, like muffins. There is no aftertaste when I used for frying. I never take black coffee, but I ran out of half and half and heard that 1 teaspoon of C oil could be used. It wasn't as good as half and half, but decent and you are getting a great dietary supplement.In the bathroom I used the oil as a makeup remover, body lotion, to put on a scab on my finger, for cuticles, to soften my heels and elbows. On several cold nights the C oil worked better than my regular moisturizer. In the morning your skin is super soft. While I was in cold Colorado for a week, the C Oil was better than any chapstick. I just put the solid oil in a small container. I used a little on my hair by rubbing a tiny bit of oil in my hands and smoothing it onto my hair ends.The oil melt quickly when it is over 76 degrees out, and more slowly when it's cool. The fragrance is wonderful and dissipates quickly. It means a lot that the product is certified organic and non-GMO. The jar is also BPA free which I love. I received this product from the manufacturer to use and review. The review is honest and I actually used the product for 35 days. There is still some left in the jar, enough for another couple of weeks.",5
"I have loved coconut oil for a long time, long before all of the health claims. I used Indian products on my hair and skin, and so what if they were not organic, they were marvelous.  Then I moved to Latin America, and lived in a place studded with coconut palms.  When I want coconut water, my friend climbs up a tree and gets me a bunch.  It surprised me when coconut water became a health fad because I was used to the read stuff, straight from the tree, and the coconut drinks in the US are not close to real, fresh coconut water.But on to the oil. It is not easy to make coconut oil from coconuts, it is time and labor intense.  Yet the outcome is extraordinary - an oil that is more pleasant than butter, and it smells better than any perfume.  I would not be the first person to mention that it feels good all over, and makes for a great massage product.Viva Lab's organic Extra Virgin oil is especially nice - sweet, fresh, clean, and obviously made with care.I am basing this review on a sample, and I am comparing it to what I've bought at Costco or at the local health food market. It wins! For cooking, grooming, relaxing, and refreshing - I simply love it.",5
"I was sent a full sized product for review by the company.I am so glad I've jumped on the coconut oil train.  I have some eczema, oily facial skin and acne.  Since winter has started, my skin is going haywire.  I've been using Viva Labs' organic extra virgin coconut oil for almost two weeks and my skin feels amazing.On my eczema patches, just rubbing a little of the oil on them softens up the skin almost immediately.  Regular use keeps the skin supple and prevents any scaling and itching.At night I wash my face before bed and smooth a small amount of oil over my face and neck.  I do this only at night because it IS an oil and it takes a while to absorb into skin.  By morning, though, my face is extremely smooth and not at all oily.  It speeds up the healing of my acne spots and I notice myself getting less oily during the day with continued nightly use.I'd like to mention that while it has a definite coconut smell, since it's natural, it smells like a coconut that's just been cracked open.  I get hungry when I use it, and the scent fades quickly.I have also used Viva Labs' coconut oil to make pancakes!  I use it in the pan before I pour in the batter and it creates a delicious pancake with a crispy outside.  It was a big hit and now my family wont let me cook them any other way.I usually use the Nutiva brand since it's readily available to me.  Given the size of the package and my experience with it, my Viva Labs coconut oil is staying with my beauty products.",5
"Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilMy daughter said: Great substitution for butter,takes 5-10 secs to melt,less time than with butter. But don't heat it too high, it starts to pop a little. I use an electric stove with a stainless steel pan. Don't heat it at high heat or medium but not at low either,just in between medium and low. It's great for dairy allergies, because it almost tastes like butter (with coconut). We toasted our pitas,bread,and things of that nature. We highly recommend it in substitute,if you are allergic to dairy. (This preceding review is by our family chef, our 11 year old daughter who is gifted at and passionate about cooking.)I enjoyed eating the product on toasted bread and on the pita bread, and also in a stir fry dish that she made. I really like the light coconut flavor, and added sea salt to the dishes that needed that to enhance the flavor more. I didn't really like hearing the popping noise when the oil got heated too high, for safety reasons. However, I am glad that she adjusted fairly quickly to cooking with this type of oil in a safe way.We try to limit our oil intake, so for our 5 person family this huge jar lasted us close to a month. Even though it is pricey at near $10, I believe we might buy it in the future, especially if we can find a coupon to use online or locally.We really like the health benefits of coconut products (and love that this is a virgin non-gmo organic product). We also have had several health pro's to recommend this type of oil for cooking and for personal grooming.Thank you to Viva Labs for sending us this free jar of this great product. Even though we got it for free, we have shared our true opinions about it here in this review.We are learning healthy eating, cooking and shopping in #ButterflyHomeschool and this opportunity to ""experiment"" with a healthy product was a great project for us, including taking time to review the product and take pictures.",5
This is the perfect alternative cooking oil.  I use it regularly to cook burgers in the skillet and they come out perfect every time.  I will be purchasing a refill soon.,5
This oil is delicious and easy to cook with. It is great in curries and can be used in place of butter for baking. It is a good skin cream as well. My husband grilled yams by wrapping them in tin foil and putting some coconut oil in the foil. They were scrumptious. I highly recommend this product.,5
"This is a healthy, versatile product that you can cook with, use on your skin and your hair. I've been using this on my skin and have noticed that it's much softer. I like to put it on my face and lips at night as the air in our home is dry as we use a wood-burning stove.I leave it on for a few hours, and then wipe the excess off just before I go to bed.Looking forward to using it instead of butter in muffins, banana bread and sweet things. The coconut has a fresh smell. I appreciate that this is organic certified and good for you. I rarely use butter or shortening anymore in baking - use olive oil, applesauce and yogurt. It's great to have another healthy substitute for butter and shortening to bake with.*sample provided for review",5
"I wasn't sure how to use this at first. But once I opened it and smelled it (it smells fresh, clean and light) and started to cook with it, I was sold. I started sauteing vegetables and this melts to a clear liquid, caramelizes veggies perfectly, and enhanced their flavor more so than cooking with vegetable or olive oil.I've also used it on dry elbows and hands and it goes on very smoothly, takes just a little bit to disappear but does a great job of moisturizing.I love how versatile it is but especially how nice it is to cook with. It did not burn or turn as it cooked and the added subtle flavor is great. I can't wait to find even more uses for it!I was provided a sample for testing.",5
"I have tried several coconut oils for natural hair care, but none of this quality.Opening the jar, the AROMA takes you away and is a wonderful tropical treat for natural hair, dissolving almost instantly by the touch of your finger tip but non-greasy.YES!!! A NON-GREASY OIL that gives shine and deeply penetrates THE SCALP without any mineral/petroleum oils, or fillers. Just the therapy I needed for my dry scalp. If your curls need a little pick-me-up, try moisturizing them as I did by mixing a little oil with clear aloe vera gel in the palms of your hands.This awesome oil also brought much relief to my husband's psoriasis flares and my dry patches from my combination skin (forehead & corners of the mouth).Obviously, there are great internal benefits and properties to this elite oil but I found just as many externally.Enjoy this treat and the compliments as well.This product was presented to me free of charge and although it is pricey the results are worth ever cent.",5
"I received this product to try it out. upon opening the jar initially, as I am not exposed to many scents, I was surprisingly overwhelmed by just how much of a coconut scent this stuff had, but I got over that pretty quickly and I use it as a skin softener. If I ever get back to cooking on a regular basis, I think that this stuff would be a great way to add flavor to any meal.as I said before, I use it as a skin softener, but I suppose because I keep my house so cold, its pretty hard to get this stuff out of the jar as it reacts to room temperatures, but since my skin feels so young and supple because of it, I don't mind the extra work getting it out of the jar. I suppose I could put it in the microwave for a few seconds though.great stuff but I don't see mainstream buying this too often if at all because it costs way too much!",5
"** I received a sample for review ***We have just stared using coconut oil on a regular basis, as an ingredient for Gluten-free cooking, and for mixing into homemade teeth creams. I had been using a different brand of organic extra virgin coconut oil, but I have to same I am very impressed with this brand!When used in cooking, the oil seems to melt back to liquid quicker than the other brand, and stay liquid longer, allowing for better mixing, and lighter baked goods. As far as imparting a flavor, it is subtle, with our flavors added, but it does seem to help enhance all the different ingredients, again, making for a tastier product. When using it in the tooth cream, that same delay in thickening so much, has allowed our creams to be more like a traditional tooth paste, and more acceptable to my daughter- always a plus!I really like this coconut oil and would be willing to buy it over the other brand, except for the cost per ounce difference. Were it less expensive, it would definitely be THE brand I would only use!",5
"I have been using the coconut oil as a luxurious moisturizer.  It feels absolutely wonderful on my skin and I can't wait to try it on my hair and in recipes.  My only reason for not giving five stars is that I can't really see this product as being something my family can afford to buy on a regular basis.  It's a bit pricey.  I do love it, but unless it goes on sale or I'm able too purchase at a discount, I don't know when I'll next be able to purchase this product.",4
"Recently, I was diagnosed by my ENT as having a swollen lingual tonsil, the tonsil at the base of the tongue. Even though I'd had my tonsils and adenoids out as a child, I learned that they never remove this particular tonsil as complications can arise. I read online that one of the natural remedies for this condition is to gargle with coconut oil, which I did, using this product, for two weeks. I returned to my ENT, who found that the tonsil had shrunk. Great news!",5
"OK, first, the manufacturer sent me this product to try out. I am a 58 year old diabetic, and am always on the look out for any thing to help me with my dry skin, especially in these harsh 9 month winters. Recently i began using cocout oil with a bit of olive oil, and found the two brands of coconut oil a bit grainy, and took some time to break down, so i assumed they were all this way. I skeptically thought I'd try it, but man was i surprised. This product is VERY smooth, to the point i use it without the olive oil. It has a delicate aroma of real coconut too. It goes on and is absorbed quickly for all day comfort. I reapply to hands and feet at bedtime, and awake feeling well nourished with NO itching.Buy it, and you will not regret it!",5
"I have been using coconut oil quite a bit in the past year and a half when I first started growing my hair natural and eating clean. I have used several different brands of coconut oil to prepare my hair products and also to cook with. I particularly enjoy using this brand because of its real ""coconutty"" smell and the ease with which it melts once it is out of the jar. As a child I used to watch my mother make her own coconut oil (we lived in the Islands) and this brand reminds me of what my Mom used to make. I have been using this oil in my hair as well as in my grand daughter's hair and I notice an increased definition in the curl pattern as well as more softness and shine. I have also been using it on my skin, especially the elbows and it helps keep them soft and non-ashy. This is an integral part of a leave in conditioner that I prepare at home using several other ingredients. This cocunut oil blends well with the other ingredients and is not hard to melt like some other coconut oils I have used in the past. If you like a product which lives up to your expectations of what pure coconut oil should be like you should definitely try this brand.",5
"My wife and I are both devoted to coconut oil...for nutritional and cosmetic uses.  We have used the Costco product because we have always liked the quality and the price and then, along came Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil...and what a difference quality makes!We use this wonderful product for cooking, baking, as a skin moisturizer (I use it as an after-shave balm) and for hair moisturizing and holding.  It is amazing how quickly it dissolves into a smooth (non-grainy) oil.  It never feels oily on the skin and gives hair and skin a healthy glow that lasts and lasts.We love it for popping corn for baking cakes and muffins and we use it as a healthy alternative to butter as a breakfast spread.I must admit, as devoted Costco customers, we were skeptical, at first, that something as common as coconut oil could be this different.Trust us, try it,  you'll like it....and you'll never go back to other products!!!",5
"I like the product quite a lot. I already had a giant jar of another brand in the cupboard. I use coconut oil almost exclusively for cooking, and for bodywork clients. I tried the Viva Labs for both. Great job in the kitchen and an especially great job for bodywork. This oil has such purity and excellent glide for massage work. Other coconut oils are good, but sometimes grainy and don't seem to have the same melt and glide that Viva's does. I've decided to use the Viva exclusively for bodywork and skin treatments. My other less expensive organic coconut oils are fine for the kitchen. One other thing. I don't personally care for the word ""Labs"" as the brand for something I'm going to eat or put on my skin. And let's face it ""Viva"" is a paper towel.",4
"I had heard a lot about coconut oil benefits but for some reason never had the chance to try it.My husband is the one who had actually bought a jar or two of coconut oil in the past and somehow I had not shown much interest or let's put it this way: by the time I decide to give it a try, he has already finished the jar! We are both dealing with a lot of stress from work and are trying to take care of our health before it is too late. Anything natural, we will give it a try!When I received my first jar of coconut oil by Viva labs, I decided that it was time to try it. I spread it on bread and made sandwiches as usual, and it tasted wonderful. I do like coconut products, anything with coconut in it reminds me of the beach and of delicious coconut drinks. I also buy coconut water regularly. My husband decided to use this coconut oil on his hair, his arm and also is eating it by teaspoons. I have not eaten it by itself because I prefer spreading it on my sandwiches,but if I will be cooking anything such as pancakes or waffles, instead of butter, I will use this coconut oil. We are almost at the bottom of the jar, and despite using it sporadically (not daily) I noticed I am not craving sweets as I used to, have a little more energy (I used to feel dead tired daily) and my stress level is under control. I am going to order 2 more of this right now after this review. The price is great also. I am glad it does taste like coconut. Great flavor! and Organic!",5
"A very good product. My sister used it on her three daughters' hair (two of them teenagers). We loved that even a few days later, the hair is still smooth, not frizzy, or sticky. The wide mouth jar is convenient to scoop the oil out. We are South Asians and love coconut oil for hair products but don't use oil these days because the girls feel it is sticky. But not this one. Would recommend.",5
"Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilCoconut oil is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of matured coconuts harvested from the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera). It has various applications in food, medicine, and industry. Because of its high saturated fat content it is slow to oxidize and, thus, resistant to rancidification, lasting up to two years without spoiling.Virgin coconut oil (VCO) can be produced from fresh coconut meat, milk, or residue. Producing it from the fresh meat involves removing the shell and washing, then either wet-milling or drying the residue, and using a screw press to extract the oil. VCO can also be extracted from fresh meat by grating and drying it to a moisture content of 10-12%, then using a manual press to extract the oil. Producing it from coconut milk involves grating the coconut and mixing it with water, then squeezing out the oil. The milk can also be fermented for 36-48 hours, the oil removed, and the cream heated to remove any remaining oil. A third option involves using a centrifuge to separate the oil from the other liquids. Coconut oil can also be extracted from the dry residue left over from the production of coconut milk.A thousand of mature coconuts weighing approximately 1,440 kilograms (3,170 lb) yield around 170 kilograms (370 lb) of copra from which around 70 liters (15 imp gal) of coconut oil can be extracted.Viva Labs was founded in 2011 by a team of doctors, nutritionists and homeopaths who are passionate about providing supplements that are superior in quality in absolutely every aspect - while still being affordable, approachable and available to anyone looking to make a positive impact on their personal health and well-being.Quality:Viva Labs are 100 % committed to providing superior holistic supplements that stand above the rest in; concentration, purity and quality.

It also appears to be safe when applied to the scalp in combination with other herbs.Since coconut oil has a high fat content, there is concern that it might increase weight if used in large amounts or that it might increase cholesterol levels. However, these concerns have not been proven in scientific research.The safety of coconut oil used in medicinal amounts is unknown.Special Precautions & Warnings:Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Coconut oil is safe for pregnant and breast-feeding women when used in the amounts normally found in the diet. But the safety of using coconut oil in larger amounts is not known. It's best to stick to food amounts if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.High cholesterol: There is concern that coconut oil might increase total cholesterol and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. But there is contradictory evidence that shows that coconut oil might actually increase levels of ""good"" cholesterol and have little to no effect on total or ""bad"" cholesterol levels.Some coconut oil products are referred to as ""virgin"" coconut oil. Unlike olive oil, there is no industry standard for the meaning of ""virgin"" coconut oil. The term has come to mean that the oil is generally unprocessed. For example, virgin coconut oil usually has not been bleached, deodorized, or refined.Some coconut oil products claim to be ""cold pressed"" coconut oil. This generally means that a mechanical method of pressing out the oil is used, but without the use of any outside heat source. The high pressure needed to press out the oil generates some heat naturally, but the temperature is controlled so that temperatures do not exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit.Coconut oil is used for diabetes, heart disease, chronic fatigue, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Alzheimer's disease, thyroid conditions, energy, and boosting the immune system. Ironically, despite coconut oil's high calorie and saturated fat content, some people use it to lose weight and lower cholesterol.Coconut oil is sometimes applied to the skin as a moisturizer and to treat a skin condition called psoriasis.A sample was furnished by Viva Labs for the purpose of an honest review. I found this sample to be everything that was promised and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try or use this coconut oil.",5
"As a person who mixes smoothies on a regular basis, I long used coconut water as part of the mix. I never thought about coconut oil before so I was eager to try it. First use was of this product was in the smoothie and it offered a creamy and nutty enhancement to my usual mix that became a new treat. Following the instructions on the container I tried using it as a butter substitute. Out of the container it is solid like butter so it seemed like for making cookies this would work. It did a great job! I still got the fluffy texture in the cookie and a nice nutty flavor that was not an overpowering taste of coconut. That really surprised me. In addition I used less coconut oil than I would have with butter. Finally as a long shot I tried using it in my hair. This process takes a little more thinking about to avoid clumping but I managed to do it. The result was that my hair was shinier and had more volume. I can't say I would do this all the time but as a test, I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. Based on these trials I am a coconut oil convert for sure.",5
"I truly love this product.  Just started using it but I find it so much better than my previous one. I love the smell, the taste, the texture.  I use on my face at night, and will be using it on my body (best of all...it's edible). Have to make myself stop eating it. Will be re-ordering soon. Fabulous product.",5
"When I was asked to accept a jar of this product in exchange for a review, I was glad to do so because I enjoy cooking up new things. I was familiar with coconut oil and had a partial jar of it in my cupboard. This brand had a more coconut-y aroma and a sweeter taste.I tried new recipes that called for this ingredient and used it as a substitute for butter in familiar recipes. I've used it in baked apples, pastry, corn chowder, granola, and cookies.  The pastry recipe I used called for a cup of butter and a half cup of coconut oil (for a two-crust pie.) That pastry was a delight when it came to fitting it into a pie plate. I could have rolled it much thinner without it splitting as I fitted it into the pan. The taste was wonderful. (Let's not mention the calories!)My cookie recipe called for butter and coconut. I was out of shredded coconut so I used coconut oil in place of the butter.  The tasty cookies had a strong coconut flavor, despite the other fruits in them.  They were also a bit oily to handle.I prefer this brand because it is certified organic and non-GMO.  However because of the cost and the high calorie count, I will use it sparingly.",5
"I am a recent convert to cooking with coconut oil, but I've used it for health and beauty purposes for a few years now. I use it as a massage oil and it mixes so well with essential oils. It's 'oily' but it doesn't leave your skin greasy. I've also recently started cooking with it, because it's a high-heat oil that tolerates being used for frying without breaking down and losing its health properties when cooking.So I was asked to review this product, and because I'm such a big fan of coconut oil, I was excited to try it. First, the container it comes in is nice and plastic, where most of the coconut oils I've used have been in glass jars. I like this because it's lighter and easier to hold and less chance of breaking (with my health issues, breaking and dropping things are common for me). The jar is sealed with a foil vacuum top to keep the oil fresh. When I received it, the oil was liquid (because it came in the mail and it's quite warm here), but once it settled at room temperature, it firmed up some and became the more solid coconut oil that you're used to seeing--however, it's a soft solid, where some coconut oils get quite hard--I love that this is a soft solid oil, because it makes mixing with essential oils and other butters and oils much easier. It also has a very nice melt to it, and does so quickly, so it's fantastic for using on skin.My first impression of the oil when I opened it was the nice, slightly sweet coconut smell. If you've never used coconut oil, you need to realize it's not like coconut milk or coconut flakes--it doesn't taste sweet (to be fair, it might have a very slight sweetness to it, but most people won't notice it at all). It tastes a lot like any other plain oil, with no flavor. But the slightly sweet scent, which goes away when you cook with it but is perfectly soft and sweet scented for using for beauty products, of this oil was wonderful. I absolutely love the smell of this coconut oil!The first thing I did was fry some potatoes with it. The oil melted nicely, held up to the heat fine, and crispy fried the potatoes beautifully!Next, I mixed the coconut oil with cinnamon essential oil. I usually use a mango or hemp butter to mix with the cinnamon oil but decided to give the coconut oil a try instead. I use this cinnamon essential oil with another massage oil for arthritis pain in my hands when I type a lot. Sometimes I'll use wintergreen essential oil too. Both the wintergreen and the cinnamon essential oil help with the inflammation and pain--and they both mixed so beautifully and smelled wonderful with this coconut oil!I also mixed it with peppermint and lemon essential oil and used it as a massage oil on my legs. It covers well, melts into the skin quickly and leaves the skin soft but without any sticky or greasy residue.You can also use room temperature coconut oil in place of shortening, something you can't do with olive oils and other liquid oils, and it's so much healthier and better for you. I haven't specifically used THIS coconut oil that way, but I've used others, and haven't been disappointed yet. This oil is high-enough quality compared to the others I've used, I'm confident in saying it would work well for baking like that.I am definitely impressed and I absolutely love that this coconut oil is certified organic, because this is important to me. Finding certified organic coconut oil in some supermarkets has been hard. I'm lucky that our Whole Foods and Central Market here locally sell it, but they are an hour's drive away from me, so I'm very happy to find an online resource for buying a quality organic coconut oil.I'm glad I was asked to review this product, because I wouldn't have seen it otherwise, and I'm definitely going to purchase it in the future. I'm a coconut oil convert!",5
"I've heard people raving about coconut oil for a few years now but I'd never tried it before. I really didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by both the scent and flavor of this oil. It's delicious! There are so many uses for it, too. I like mixing a small amount with peanut butter to make an extra creamy spread with a hint of coconut flavor. It's really good as a moisturizer, too. I scooped some out of the big jar and put it in a separate smaller jar to use on my hands, feet, body and hair. It melts almost immediately and sinks in the skin very quickly. It's not greasy and sticky like I imagined it would be. I really love this stuff. I'm a new fan!",5
This product is absolutely fantastic!!  It makes great shrimp. It is great for moisturizing your hands and has such a fantastic smell.  My daughter suggested I buy it because she tried it.  I am so glad I listened to her.,5
"I used this on dry skin which really helped, especially on my dry legs, used it by taking a teaspoon a day which helped me with an annoying side effect of some of my medications, added it to cake in lieu of cooking oil, which added a nice additional flavor and cooked sweet corn with it. When I used it for my dry skin it dawned on me because of it being oil that it might just remove waterproof mascara. I rubbed my fingers on the lid of the jar and then coated my lashes with it. I waited a couple minutes and the mascara came off better than any eye make up remover I have ever purchased. Best of all I love the smell.",5
"Trying this coconut oil has been a wonderful surprise. My taste buds love it, my digestion loves it, my feet are softer because of it. My hair loves it. Did you know eating coconut oil bypasses the body's gall bladder process, so its easier on one's digestive system. When I take a tablespoonful first thing in the morning it feels comforting, soothing and really satisfying. I love the taste.It's rare to find something so good for you and it's enjoyable too. I like that coconut oil strengthens the immune system and facilitates inter cellular communication with the short- and medium-chain fatty acids. Knowing this and having a most pleasant taste certainly makes for a healthy habit that my body can happily say 'yes' to.I rubbed a spoonful of the oil into my hands and then onto the heels of my feet and then went about my day. At the end of the day after only one application of the Viva Labs coconut oil, there was not one sign of dry or cracked skin on my heels! Amazing. Viva Labs is my new first choice for coconut oil. Thanks Viva Labs! Barbara J. Semple, instanthealingzone.com",5
I use this as a skin moisturizer. It smells delicious and feels nice on my skin. I will order again.,5
We are big time coconut oil fans and use it on as many foods and shakes as possible and other thingsincluding hair and body care. This Vita Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil  is now on top of our list.When we first got it the packaging was nice but nothing really specialThe seal on the inside we did like...and the container was as full as you can get.The label also had the good news of NO GMO and it is Organic...two big pluses for us!We removed the seal and the smell was incredible and clean...really enjoyed this part!(Still smells great as i am writing this review)The texture and color was smooth and pure white.Then i did the taste test by taking out a marble sized piece and put it in my mouth.It melted nicely and the taste was as good as it gets. I was really surprised at how good it tasted.My wife agreed.The combination of the smell and taste was divine.Every so often i like to scoop out a teaspoon of Coconut oil and eat it like Ice CreamI will be using the Vita Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil mainly as my teaspoon treat :-)Great stuff and glad to give them 5 stars for making an outstanding product!!!!!We will be using it for many things.,5
"This is such a fantastic product, it's only the second brand of coconut oil I've tried, but it's my favorite. I'm using it both for oil pulling (my teeth have never been so happy) and in smoothies as well as on my hair (which I blow dry and flat iron daily). I'm actually looking forward to finding new uses for it. I bought 2 containers - 1 for the kitchen and one for the bathroom!Highly recommend!!",5
"I knew that this ""super food's"" popularity had been increasing lately, but I'd yet to experience it for myself. Viva labs sent me a jar to try, and I can honestly say that they've gained a loyal customer in me.The first thing that caught me when opening this product was the smell. The sweet and distinctive smell of coconut almost knocks you off of your feet. It was more fragrant than any coconut product I'd ever tried. I immediately dove in, eager to experience the skin moisturizing effects. I rubbed a tad on my dry elbows. My elbows were soft and supple for the rest of the day. My husband enjoyed the smell as well. He made every excuse to get close and catch a whiff. lol.Being an African-American woman, I'd heard tons of talk in my community of how wonderful coconut oil is for ethnic hair; but again, I'd yet to experience any of the benefits for myself. I used Viva's Coconut Oil on both me and my daughter's hair for about a week as a sealant and protector after washing. (It's also great as a pre-treatment before washing.) I have a distinct 4-b/c curl and my daughter has a 4-a curl. We BOTH have noticed a change in our hair. It's softer to the touch with a beautiful sheen. I was in love!I've yet to use this product as a supplement, but I have used it to replace butter in a few of my recipes. If you can get past the obvious ""coconutty"" after-taste, it's actually quite a pleasant flavor, and it proves to be a wonderful substitute.All in all, this is a fantastic product with tons of health and body benefits. For the price you get a great amount of product. This is a must-buy if you haven't already.",5
"I was given a sample of this product in exchange for writing an honest review, so here it goes:I have been using coconut oil for cooking for the last couple of years and this is definitely a phenomenal choice. It smells fresh, cooks very well on the stove, and seems to be be a better choice than any brand I've tried so far.If you're considering coconut oil for the first time, or you want to upgrade from another brand, Viva Labs offers some great stuff here!",5
"I have only used it for 1 week but I will give my feed back and update as well.The first thing I noticed when I opened the container was the true and rich scent of coconut - the smell, amazing, addicting. My roommates walked in on me several times holding the container to my nose sniffing.I've been meaning to attempt to make a coconut smoothie and since this smelled so delicious and is food grade, I had added it to my tropical smoothie. On the container it said 1-2 tbs as supplements. I'm sure it has the benefits but the actually flavor of coconut did not come through in my 20 ounce of smoothie - perhaps it was too much strawberry masking it.I've used coconut for cooking and that worked well - and in place of crisco - which is partially hydrogenated oils (aka uber bad for your health).Lastly, I tested it as a moisturizer. This coconut oil takes a while to massage in and will feel freezing (it's unprocessed oil afterall) but does absorb well. I usually have cracked skin during the wintertime so I tend to test this product out over this winter as well. I have a medical condition called ""anhydrosis"" - which is that I don't sweat - and my skin then may become easily dried. My doctor has told me there is no need to shower every day (as I don't sweat anyways) and that way I won't lose the little natural oil that I manage to produce. I take a full shower every 2-3 days (wash face and other parts daily) and I would rub on the coconut oil on my arms, legs, and torso as soon as I dry my skin. I notice on the 3rd day my skin is still supple. So far, I love this product. Favorite part is the scent - true to coconut and very addicting as it is potent but not overwhelming. I am going to go sniff it again.",5
"Aloha, we use Coconut Oil in so many ways: cooking, baking, salves, hair, etc. Viva's Organic Coconut Oil is lovely. If you are new to coconut oil, try it in place on oil when you cook eggs, stir fry, onions, etc. Coconut oil can take high heat and imparts such a nice flavor into your food. We also add it to smoothies, just a tablespoon. Muffins made with coconut oil gives a whole new level of flavor. Try Viva and see what you've been missing.",5
"Coconut oil is one of the recent ""it"" foods, but is it worth the buzz? Yes. The Viva labs coconut oil is high quality coconut oil. It works for cooking, and it works for softening skin and soothing and adding shine to hair.The viva labs coconut oil is more liquid at room temp than others I have tried, so be careful when opening that you don't spill any. Some are more like shortening consistency.Like most coconut oils there are no trans fats, but the USDA certified organic oil is good if one is using the oil to be healthy.Sample provided for honest review.",5
Best coconut oil I've bought to date. Not grainy and doesn't get rock hard. I got it on sale and plan on getting it only from now on!,5
"This coconut oil is very smooth out of the jar at room temperatures, kind of like a soft butter if spread onto toast. The flavor is very mild as well, nothing pungent or overbearing. I don't use it on my skin, but I think it would work well since it does not have bits of the coconut meat mixed in, and has only a very slight smell compared to a fresh coconut or canned water. I really like that it is non-GMO as well. Overall, this seems like a very good quality product.",5
This product is great.  I take the recommended amount before workout and can notice the increase in energy I have before and afterwards.  I also add this to my coffee in the morning and love the affect it has on my work day.,5
"We all know Coconut oil is great, this brand provides a high quality product that won't disappoint. I have been using the oil in my coffee, for baking, even in facial creams, it is seriously great stuff. The fact that is it non-GMO and is USDA organic are the main reasons I chose this brand, but after seeing the high quality of the cold pressed oil I will not be going back to any machine pressed oils ever again. A great buy, and with amazon shipping / returns you don't have to worry.",5
"I just used this coconut oil for the first time last night when I made peanut butter and chocolate covered bananas for dessert. From what I can tell, this coconut oil is of really great quality. From what I've read on their site, it looks like they produce some very high quality coconut oil. I will definitely be adding this brand into my small list of coconut oils I buy. :)As for the PB chocolate bananas.. all you do is slice up bananas and spread peanut butter on top. Then you put a teaspoon or two of coconut oil (depending on how much you're making) in a small sauce pan, turn the heat on low and let it melt until it covers the bottom of the pan. Dump in chocolate chips (there's really no measurement.. I just pour in whatever. The coconut oil is just to prevent the chocolate from sticking to the pan, it makes the chocolate a little more liquidy and it adds a beneficial fat to your dessert). Spoon chocolate over peanut butter bananas (I have my bananas on a plate w/ If You Care parchment paper) and stick in freezer. Let harden and enjoy. Yummy. :)",5
I wanted extra virgin coconut oil for popping popcorn on the stove. I also wanted the organic kind for the health benefits. This product is great and it was the cheapest price I found for an organic product. I have started to use it for many other things now. But the popcorn came out really good! So yummy I have eaten it without butter.,5
"Got this for my pets who have dry skin.They love it, will actually eat if off of a spoon, and they are prissy divas.Haven't tried cooking with it yet, but will do.",5
"Disclaimer - I was sent this item free, but with no strings attached.We've enjoyed this coconut oil, but we only use coconut oil for cooking.  We've used primarily Tropical Traditions in the past, and the price for this size of container compares well to that brand.  Currently TT offers a similar price (very slightly higher) but seemingly as a temporary sale.  However, you can save a bit of money by getting larger containers.  If you use copious amounts of the stuff in cooking, it helps to save a bit of money, and a small container like this one can go fairly quickly in our household, maybe in just a week or two.  It would be nice if larger containers were offered, which would also be better for the environment as well plastics would need to be used per amount of oil.  The only other downside I guess is the use of plastic for the container, but other manufacturers use plastic as well.  I have seen glass used for this size and slightly bigger, but that's it, and only for some brands.As far as the taste goes, it met with approval of our family.  Because it is ""cold pressed"" (e.g. expeller pressed), it does not contain bits of coconut in it, which is either a good thing or bad thing depending on your tastes and how you use the product.",4
"After typically using coconut oil sold by a major grocery chain, I was inspired to try the Viva Labs product. After consuming it for a few days I feel inspired to say that the quality and taste of this oil truly is superb. The texture and the smell also stands out in a very positive way; even the packaging is top-notch. As such, I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in purchasing and using coconut oil.",5
"I have used several different brands of coconut oil before, so I was very excited to get to try the Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by Viva Labs.  Coconut oil can be a great alternative in many instances while cooking and I really like some of the health and beauty aspects of the product as well.Out of all the brands of coconut oil out there, there are many reasons why Viva Labs brand is a very serious contender in the marketplace.  First, it is USDA certified organic and non-GMO.  Genetically Modified [Organisms] Food, is becoming more and more popular today by food manufacturers.  Grain, fruits, veggies and more are all becoming targets; but we haven't had enough time to know that modifying certain foods is very safe in the long run for our bodies and diets.  Knowing this product comes from pure, unaltered coconuts is very reliving and appealing.Surprisingly, I can taste a difference with this brand of extra virgin coconut oil when compared to my former brand.  After opening the jar and breaking the foil seal, you are immediately greeted with the strong sent of coconut.  This product smells so amazing I cannot believe the other brand I have been using was even coconut oil at all. It's like cracking a fresh coconut in your own kitchen.When it comes to uses for coconut oil, I usually use a dab or two in my pan when frying an egg in the morning and I like the very mild hint of coconut that is added to the taste.  I have also used coconut oil in my hair and it does make a difference in the look and health of it.  I have never tried using coconut oil as a supplement since other brands I have used look and feel like real lard.  However, the Viva Labs brand smells so great I think I might begin trying it as a supplement.As a man who has tried at least five different brands of coconut oil, several of which are sold on amazon, there often is a difference between brands.  After having tried Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, I think I will be using their brand from now on.  It smells so pure and it has many certifications that I know some of the other brands I have tried simply do not have.  If you like of have a desire to try coconut oil, I would recommend trying this product.Disclosure: I want you to know I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review. However, a review in exchange for the review sample was not promised. The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.",5
"They sent me this oil to try & I was impressed by the mellow smell and it's very ""light""...so it's good for cooking and everything else. Absorbed nicely on skin too. It's always best to buy organic! The Only thing I would change is that it comes in a plastic container & that's not the best way to store coconut oil.",4
"Used it for grilled cheese sandwiches. I usually use butter, now I will never use butter again! The sandwiches had a pleasant taste, and were not greasy at all.",5
"i liked the container. i use it for my skin...has a very light scent. rubs on wonderfully, melts quickly in your hand and onto skin. soaks in realitively quick for an oil. haven't cooked with it yet, but can't wait to make shrimp with it.",5
"I have used Coconut oil for many years.It was 88 the day this arrived so it was liquid.  Once theweather cools the oil thickens.  That's my favorite time.One trick I like is to take a small spoonful & eat it when I am craving something.  It kills cravings for me.  This oil is wonderful.  You would think, yuk, eating oil.  But this oil is different.  It does not stick all in your mouth.  It feels like it dissolves.  It has a mild Coconut flavor, not sweet.  I use it to cook my eggs over easy.  I made a Pumpkin cake last night that came out wonderful.  Although it has a coconut flavor, it doesn't come through when cooking.Coconut oil is a medium chain fatty acid.  It has many health benefits.  You can use it on lips (feels so good)on skin.  Eating the tsp can help skin from the inside.  It is more easily absorbed through the digestive system.  Below are a few links to provide more info on health benefits.  You may think, saturated fat, but it actually helps cholesterol.

"I am vegan, use natural products, and am always searching for quality.  Many times I am disappointed by products I buy or asked to try - not this one.  Non-GMO & Organic jumped right out at me, but I was wary about the quality.  Let me say that of the two other brands I've used over the years, Spectrum & NOW, this one stands way above those two.  For starters - when opening the jar, you actually SMELL coconut!  No so with the other brands.  So far, using a recipe by Douglas McNish, I have used this oil in the Chocolate Sauce (page 369) and it was very smooth and creamy.  I haven't had the product long (about a week), so I plan to make the Banana Cocnut Hotcakes & Pecan Pie from McNish's book.  I will update this review then.  As for using this product for healthcare - fabulous.  I use coconut oil for my very dry skin because it provides perfect lubrication and skin actually ages slower (I'm 55 years old and my skin is that of a 25 year old due to years of natural care). This brand of coconut oil goes on smooth without a ""greasy"" feel. It also combines well with other ingredients.  I highly recommend this product and I do not see the day when I will use another brand.Added 11/05/13:  I recently made the raw Pumpkin Pie in the book by Chef Douglas McNish and used this coconut oil.  I can tell you that this pie was delicious and smooth.  I continue to experiment with this product and have not been disappointed.",5
"We used to use Trader Joe's coconut oil for everything, but we decided to give this a shot. The smell, texture, smoothness, and quality were apparent right away. While we haven't used it for cooking yet (and we intend to), but we've been using it as a remedy for our daughter's dry skin, and her skin has dramatically improved. I've even used it in a pinch as a diaper rash ointment, which also worked spectacularly.Overall, we are extremely satisfied!",5
"I just love this coconut oil. I have dry skin. I sometimes avoid using lotions and creams because they leave my skin feeling greasy and sticky. Viva Labs coconut oil, however, just soaks right in without leaving any of that yucky residue behind!Viva Labs, I think I love you!",5
"Try this coconut oil and you will LOVE it.  I live in Hawaii and we have about 20 organic coconut trees on our property.  We harvest our own fresh coconuts and I was suspicious that any commercial product would live up to our expectations.  We don't harvest our own coconut oil because the process is too tedious and time consuming, but if we ever do, I will be thrilled if it even comes close to matching this 100% natural, organic, GMO free product.The first time I used this coconut oil, I heated some up in a skillet.  The subtle aroma of coconut coming from the pan told me that this was no adulterated coconut oil ""product"", but 100% real coconut oil.  The oil did not smoke, nor did it splatter when I added some local Hawaiian sliced bananas in a light tempura-like batter.  They became lightly brown and perfect after a few turns.  Half of them I drizzled with a coconut milk/vanilla/natural cane sugar sauce, and the rest of them I used some local organic honey with a pinch of cinnamon.  THEY WERE DELICIOUS.  The coconut oil made all the difference.  I am going to use this product again and again!",5
I use coconut oil for cooking so I am familiar with some of the products available.  However I had never before used it as a moisturizer.I was surprised at how effective it was.  I have dry hands and feet.  I would have never thought of using coconut oil as a moisturizer had it not been suggested on the packaging.  It softens the skin and works as well as many lotions that I have tried.  If you use a light application and rub it in well then it is not greasy in the least.  I would have anticipated greasiness but it goes on lighter than some lotions.I also used this oil on my son's scalp.  He is two years old and has a dry flaky scalp.  Because he is so young and delicate I don't like to use chemical products on him.  This oil however is gentle on his scalp and relieves his dryness and itching.I have not used it on my own hair.  However I did use it on my son's hair because of his scalp.  His hair is shiny and more curly after using this oil.  So cute!For cooking I use this oil in rice and curry.  For rice I put a little bit in the rice cooker at the beginning with the water and dry rice.  It flavors the rice and gives the kitchen a nice smell too.  I also add it to Thai curry and I have to say that for this purpose it is the best tasting coconut oil that I have ever tried.  The oil is fragrant and has a wonderful taste.  It actually tastes good on its own as well.I have tried a few other organic coconut oils but this one is the tastiest by far.,5
"I recieved this product for free and was asked to provide an honest review.  Here it is:  I cook almost every meal at my house from scratch.  I just enjoy cooking and baking.  I just started using this coconut oil, and I have to say I am very impressed.  First I made sugar cookies with it - just used it like I would butter.  It whipped up wonderfully and has a nice subtle taste of coconut.  No one (except me) likes coconut in my house, so I was surprized that everyone loved the cookies.  I made a frosting for the butter cream - now known as coconut cream.  Wonderful.  One morning I made my husband his favorite breakfast - eggs, bacon, waffles - used the coconut oil to replace all other oils and butter, everyone liked it.  I have also used it to fry rice (stir fry).  Needless to say I am a big fan.  The only issue is the price.  A pound of butter is about 4.00 (organic).  Its worth it for me though because my son gets very sick if he has too much milk, although he is not allergic, he is lactose intolerant as is his sister.  So I will feel better making his cookies with this verus butter.I should mention that this oil is hard, so it does make a very good moisturizer for cracked hands (and feet).  My hands crack every winter - it is very very painful, and my feet are always cracked.  I have used this product for that and it feels very good.  Now, I won't lie and say my feet are, after a few days, no longer cracked, but they are softer.",5
"* I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes.I look for two main things in coconut oil. The first is that it smells like coconuts when I open it... and this does!Second, I look for the USDA Organic seal. This one has that too!This is a great high-quality coconut oil that I've used quite frequently in light pan frying. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for coconut oil. Don't take a chance buying coconut oil in the grocery store... buy this online instead.",5
"I've used coconut oil for a number of years and have always purchased Spectrum Naturals. No more. I was given Viva Labs coconut oil as a gift in a baking basket and can't say enough good things about it. Right off the bat, the first thing you'll notice is the pleasant (but faint) coconut smell. That's especially nice if you use the product for some of the non-baking applications (yes, it does indeed work like a champ on dry skin, especially the heels). I'm really impressed with the consistency of the product and how nicely it incorporates into recipes. Other coconut oils I used to use would tend to congeal a bit upon cooling. Viva's doesn't. I use it in chocolate chip cookies to deepen the flavor and give them a more complex taste (substitute one third of the butter called for with Viva Labs coconut oil and use it to lightly grease the cookie sheet). It also makes killer popcorn. I use the Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cup, White and Great Northern Popcorn Organic Premium Popcorn, 5 Pound instead of store bought microwave popcorn (which is full of sodium, artificial ingredients and bad fat). Roughly a kitchen (not a measuring) teaspoon of the coconut oil at the bottom of the popper is all you need for the closest thing you'll find to classic movie theatre popcorn. Spectrum oil would sometimes tend to a slightly burnt taste but the Viva Labs adds a wonderfully nutty flavor and makes the popcorn light and crunchy without feeling greasy. An excellent, versatile product that also has all of the right organic/non-GMO qualifiers. Exceedingly happy customer.",5
"Coconut-oil is a great way to add healthy fats to your diet. It's got a very nice flavor and does a great job cooking up veggies, especially for curry dishes but even as an alternative to olive oil. It does, definitely, add the flavor of coconut to whatever you cook with it, so it might not be suitable for some dishes. (I tried cooking up green peppers and onions for black beans and rice, instead of my usual olive oil, and in that dish the coconut felt out of place. In curry dishes and for many other uses, though, it is quite nice.)This brand is organic and GMO-free, free of pesticides and suitable for vegan diets. At room temperature it solidifies, but only slightly and remains almost a liquid. You just scoop it out and it handles beautifully.The other day, even, we cooked up a vegetable soup. It was good, but missing something. At that point, I might have added butter to avoid blandness, but I had this handy and dropped in a couple tablespoons of coconut oil. It was amazing what it did for the soup. Just a hint of coconut and a bit of oil made it delicious.I also, occasionally, add a bit to a green smoothie in the morning as an alternative to the usual fresh peanut butter. It adds a lot, both to the flavor and consistency.I was offered a sample jar by the manufacturer for the purpose of testing and review. I'm very happy that I tried it and expect to keep buying it as a supplement in the future when I finish with this jar.",4
"We use a tremendous amount of coconut oil in our house.  For all things cooking, baking, shaving, moisturizing, sunscreen, hair conditioners, etc.Needless to say we have several jars hanging around at all times.  I really enjoyed this one the most for cooking.The flavor is very light.  My husband doesn't like the taste of coconut anything and often times when I create a dish he can taste the coconut ""essence""but that was not the case with this one.  I'll probably stick with this brand when cooking just for that reason and not waste it shaving and conditioning my hair.If I had to say one negative thing about it, it would be that I'd like it to be in a glass jar rather than plastic container.But really, that's just kind of being picky.",5
"I only recently got introduced to Coconut Oil, having purchased a similarly sized tub in the grocery store organic aisle for $30 (!). After trying Viva Labs Coconut Oil, I won't be using another brand any time soon.Not only is the price excellent and affordable, the coconut oil is at least the same quality as the fancy version I purchased originally for much more, if not better.My only problem now is waiting for another tub: since we discovered so many uses for coconut oil, we want to keep one in the kitchen and one in the bathroom. We use it for frying, seasoning cast iron, keeping my husband's dry  hands from cracking, treating minor cuts and scrapes (prevents infection and creates a natural barrier), deep conditioning my hair every few weeks, and as a supplement.I have hypothyroidism and have struggled recently with dry, frizzy hair. I add the coconut oil to my coffee in the morning (a teaspoon or so, tastes wonderful but stir vigorously initially) and to any food that makes sense: yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies, etc.It smells wonderful, melts quickly in just your hands, and isn't greasy. Love it!",5
"I use coconut oil in basically everything, and I've tried quite a few companies. In my opinion Viva Labs Coconut Oil is the best I have tried! The consistency is good, you hardly have to warm it up at all, and the flavor is really delicious. I've used this product for approximately a month and I love it. It is most effective using it as a moisturizer for my face, I just warm it up in my hand and use it straight without adding anything to it, it works fantastic under my foundation (I do have dry patches, which is probably why it works so well) and I have not had a problem with breakouts. I would recommend this brand not only for the price but definitely for quality.",5
"I was very excited to try out Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. Not only have I heard that Coconut Oil has great health benefits if you use it as a supplement, but I also heard that it is a great option for cooking oil. Reading the label on the Viva Labs container I learned it can be used for skin and hair care too.Viva Labs Coconut Oil is certified USDA Organic, CCOF Certified Organic and is a NON GMO Project Verified. Besides all the health, cooking and skin and hair care benefits, the certifications caught my attention too. I know that USDA Organic is a seal I look for and respect because the process to be able to be USDA Organic is extensive and I usually choose products with this seal for my family.I did not know about the other certifications so I had to look them up. CCOF Certified Organic stands for California Certified Organic Farmers and was the first organic certification entity in the U.S. The NON GMO Project Verified seal means that there are no genetically modified organisms used in the product. I did more research on NON GMO, because I was curious and found their website very helpful and interesting.Trying Coconut Oil out in the kitchen, I found that we will have to get used to the taste of it for sauted vegetables; it's not a bad taste, just different. As a family we have made other healthy changes that we had to get adjusted to and I think it will be just a matter of time and we will prefer coconut oil to all other oils.I originally only wanted to only try the Coconut Oil in cooking but I decided to give it a try on my hair too! As for hair care, I found coconut oil to be the perfect restorative mask! My hair is dry on the ends and tangles easily. The Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil really gave my hair a nice soft feeling. So needless to say, I'll be getting another container so that I can have one in the kitchen and one in the bathroom!",5
"I was pleasantly surprised when I received an offer of a free jar of this for the consideration of a review.  I already used coconut oil for cooking for my Jorge Cruise ""The 100"" diet and even before that.I promised to give a totally unbiased review, no matter if I liked it or hated it.Well, I love the stuff!  When I opened up the container I could see how different it was from the one I bought from Vitacost.  And so much creamier and when I took a little of the inside of the lid and put in on my hands, yummy!  It smelled like I was breathing in the smells from a bag of coconut, and then when I sniffed by hand, it smelled so good I had to also take a little and taste it.  I had to keep myself from grabbing a spoon, really!I make ""The 100"" recipe for a flax microwave muffin and with this coconut oil the muffin is so much lighter, moister and so much easier to mix together!  The muffin actually tastes better with this oil than when I substituted real butter.Now each morning, I take a fork and dollop out the teaspoon sized bit of this coconut oil, put it in with the rest of the ingredients and put whatever oil is left stuck to the fork and put it on my hands.  That little tiny bit is enough to cover the top of both of my hands, it melts so smoothly just with the warmth of my skin.I am also hoping that they soon offer it in larger containers or discounted sets of two or more.  I can see myself ordering this oil for a long time to come.  I'm sure there are a lot more recipes that I can use this for.  Hmm, chocolate cake?  :-)",5
"The first time that I tried Coconut Oil was over my brother house and I was telling him how dry my skin is especially in the winter because of the dry forced air heat, I told him that I have tried every thing and he told me I have not tried Coconut Oil, he had a very large jar of it and he gave me a small amount to rub on my arm I had went home took a shower and after the shower is when I start applying Argon oil to my skin and I notice that my arm was still moist and soft and still hydrated from the coconut oil so now I'm sold I also put on my hair too I HIGHLY recommend this oil, and it smells fantastic too.",5
"My wife has been using a different brand of coconut oil for various uses, other than consuming. However, when I got my hands on this Viva Labs coconut oil, I didn't know what I was missing. I have no intentions on using this for my skin, or for my hair. I have every intention on consuming this entirely by myself. The flavor and consistency is much better than the ""other brand"" my wife uses. I'll chalk that up to the fact that this is cold-pressed, so it doesn't denature the resulting product at all. I eat a few spoonfuls (tablespoon size) servings a day. Definitely top quality fats to add to my diet.",5
"We've recently started using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to cook and have tried about two other brands of coconut oil. The difference was very noticeable though! This coconut oil had a very strong aroma of coconut that you could smell as you come down the hallway towards the kitchen. The other ones I've tried didn't have that. The smell was absolutely amazing, and made it feel much more authentic.Update 10/15/2013 I used this again this weekend and just felt like I should mention how much I love the smell. Even with the tiniest tip of coconut oil in something you're cooking, you get such a strong aroma of coconut in the room and in your plate. I'm from Trinidad and Tobago and the smell brings back so many images and memories of home. love it!The thing I also love about coconut oil is that it has a much higher flash point than the vegetable oil so if needed I can heat it much hotter than regular oil and it's great for cooking. It dissolves into a nice clear slippery grease and it adds a wonderful flavor to you food. It's like adding coconut milk to your food, except without the milk! ha!I would definitely recommend this product. It's healthy and great tasting and has a wonderful smell.",5
"Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil? And its delicious. My first reaction was not favorable until I actually tasted it. Its almost too creamy and tasty; full of coconut taste. Coconut oil is good for your health and has no cholesterol. It is suggested to consume up to 4 tablespoons daily if you want.It can also be used for cooking instead of butter or any other greasy cooking material. It is completely dairy-free making it great for those who are sensitive in that area. You can use it to saute vegetables for a crispy, tasty side dish.Skin care is a great use for this coconut oil. Simply apply it to a dry area and it almost instantly replenished. It is a bit greasy, so a little amount goes along way. I placed it on my elbows, knees and a rough patch after shaving and it slowly soaked in and make my skin surface even and smooth.It is also recommended for hair care. It is recommended to use only a tablespoon and rub it into your dry hair and let it sit for one to two hours for hair nourishment. It did take out my split ends (grey hair) but I had to wash my hair thoroughly twice to get all the oil out.For the price and the variety of sues, I can see how many people will love to use this product. It also doesnt need refrigeration; just a cool dry place to store. Product supplied for an honest review.",5
"When I had an opportunity to test and review this product, I was a little cautious.Coconut oil?  What's that?  But, I have come to understand that it is as all purpose asolive oil.  Thinking it was a moisturizer, something for my hands and skin, that is whereI started.  Smells wonderful!  Instantly liquifies on contact, and lasts for hours.Just a little drop is all I used.  Chapped legs?  gone.  Hands?  soft and beautiful.I do understand that this can also be used for cooking.  I think I'll start withrice.  Perhaps shrimp.  Right now, the jar is in my pantry, waiting.I do love this stuff.  And my hands love it, too.",5
"Reviewer's note: I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest and completely objective review.I have family members who have used coconut oil both for cooking and as a dietary supplement - however, I agreed to try Viva Labs Coconut Oil for a very different reason: my doctor recommended I try coconut oil to alleviate the side effects of a prescription that I've been taking.Anyone who has ever had excessively dry skin as a side effect from prescription meds understands how annoying it can be - and I've tried the ""best"" and certainly most expensive brand name skin care lotions you can buy: Aveeno, Lubriderm, and countless others. I'm constantly using hand lotion throughout the day, to the point of considerable distraction.I began using Viva Labs Coconut Oil three days ago and my first reaction was that it's too greasy to use on my hands and arms and still be functional (i.e. work on the computer or handle books, papers) - however, I quickly realized that once my skin began absorbing the oil it gave me considerable relief from the constant dryness and itching that I've been experiencing, and more importantly, I wasn't constantly having to go back for more lotion. I'd been using Lubriderm 2-3 times an hour - but with the Coconut Oil I've begun using it once in the morning and once at night, and I am very pleased with the results I've had to this point.I have a single 15-ounce container of the oil but so far it looks as if it will last a good while and probably be more cost efficient than the expensive lotion brands that I've been using.All things considered I plan to continue using this product and I'd highly recommend it for the purposes I've described above.",5
"Since the book, ""Coconut Oil Miracle"" was published in 2004, I've been a devotee of coconut oil. I've gone through just about every brand I've ever encountered. Out of all the brands I tried, Nutiva has been my oil of choice.When I was offered a sample of Viva coconut oil to try, I thought, ""Why not?, but I'll never switch.""Well I'm here to tell you that I really was impressed with this product.I live in a cold climate and if you know anything about coconut oil, you know how solid it gets in the cold. You would think solid is solid. Now I know that's not so. Viva oil, while solid in the cold melts much quicker and more evenly than Nutiva. It also spreads easier on bread products than the Nutiva brand..The smell is more prevalent and the flavor seems brighter. It's wonderful for cooking and it seems to blend better when I mix it in orange or V-8 juice.I have eczema on my scalp and coconut oil used once a week is a great help in relieving the itching that accompanies this condition.Give Viva coconut oil a try whether you are a new or established user. You'll be glad you did. A recommended product.",5
"I have bought a number of coconut oils in the past, from various fresh produce stores in my area.  I have used oils that don't taste or smell like coconuts at all, and have found oils that were lumpy as well as smooth.Although all of the oils I tasted were great, I must admit that this product offers a unique flavor--as well as scent--and as well as texture.I am unsure if it is the way the oil is churned, and processed--but the texture is incredibly compact, and almost wax like.  But don't let that fool you.  One small dip with a spoon or a butter knife, and the oil flows easily.  Nice!I suffer from eczema in the winter.  The palms of my hands get incredibly dry and tend to flake.  I have used expensive prescription steroid creams in the past, and although the symptoms subside, I wind up needing to use the steroids often--which I do not want to do.Since receiving this oil in the mail I have used it on my palms and in one night, the flakiness on my palms has disappeared.I also used this oil in my hair as a mask, and have even added a tsp to my morning coffee--which is awesome by the way.I have also used it to remove my eye make-up, and as a nighttime moisturizer for my skin.  I also learned that coconut oil acts as a skin lightener over time, so I have also begun dabbing it on my stubborn sun spots.  I need to get another jar for my bathroom, and my daughters bathrooms, because we tend to argue over who used the oil last.Today I am making corn muffins and will be using the coconut oil in place of butter...I am feeling pretty confident that the texture of the muffins will be smooth, light, and creamy.I am about to stir up some spinach and garlic for our breakfast omelette and will be using this oil instead of a cooking spray to grease the pan.  I have done this before, and the results have been amazing.Because the oil has such a high heat tolerance, the food never burns.This truly is an amazing product...and yes--you should be using it...PS...yes...the oil is great for lowering bad cholesterol and raising the good cholesterol...I'd say its a miracle product...Namaste...",5
"First off, I love that this coconut oil is cold pressed!Taste: This has just the right hint of coconut flavor to add a zest to your foods. I have used many different brands of coconut oil the past, and many of them have way too much of a ""coconut"" tase to them.Price: With 30 servings in the container, it comes to about $.30/serving.  For the quality and standards this product was made from, that's an outstanding deal.Texture: Very smooth.  I've used many coconut oil's that have a very hard texture, making it difficult to spread on breads or use for cooking.Uses: I currently use this to cook, and I even use it as a ""butter"" on my ezekiel bread. I also have very curly/frizzy hair and find that coconut oil helps calm it down.  I haven't tried this on my skin just yet.Thank you Viva Labs for letting me try your product, I am VERY impressed!",5
"I recently got some Viva Labs extra virgin coconut oil.  It was great timing for me because I was wondering how I could make this spontaneously appearing allergic rash on my skin disappear.  It felt as itchy as if I had been sleeping in poison ivy!Anyway, I slathered the coconut oil on the affected area.  It softens up real fast.  Within about an hour the itching stopped.  I am sensitive to environmental toxins.  I prefer to use natural products for better health.  Viva labs' organic coconut oil came to my rescue.  Viva's organic coconut oil is great!Review update:  11 November 2013I've been using the coconut oil for about a month now.  After reading up more on the health benefits of extra virgin, organic coconut oil, I've also added it to my diet.  I no longer use butter for cooking.  Instead, I use this coconut oil.And I'm glad I made the change over.  The aroma of this coconut oil tickles my olfactory nerves like I'm at Disneyland.  I LOVE smelling it.  It's great when I cook my scrambled eggs.  Makes them taste mouth-watering.I love its natural fragrance as I put it on my body.  I really am a fan of Viva's organic coconut oil.Is it affordable?  When it comes to my good health it's VERY affordable.  I am worth buying this high quality product.  It's something with no garbage it in.Remember, your skin is the largest organ of the body.  So when you put it on, you are really affecting everything!  (And in a GOOD way!)I told my husband about it.  He and I like using it for our dry hands in this colder weather.  I encourage you to check out Viva's Coconut Oil.  You are worth investing in your health.  Instead of using some processed product with harmful chemicals in it for your dry skin or to cook with, you just gotta get Viva organic coconut oil.  You'll LOVE it!Susan FoxAuthor, The Coma Whisperer",5
"I've been using the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for a little over 2 weeks now and am truly pleased.First, let me start off by saying I use coconut oil for everything from cooking, hair and skin. So, upon receiving my jar, I separate what I will use for cooking in a glass amber jar (great for preservation outside of the Viva Labs opaque jar). With that being said I've enjoyed using this oil. It smells great, goes on smooth and truly provides great moisture.*Cooking*I use this when baking, sauteing and sometimes even on toast - I saw another rater had used it in their oatmeal, I'm definitely going to have to try that. It adds a definitely flavor pop but is not at all overpowering.*Hair*I use this as a pre-shampoo treatment for my African American hair - not going to get into hair types but I would be 4b-c. It softens my strands while providing adequate moisture and shine. I also will use this to seal in liquid or cream moisturizers for a twist/braid out. I usually apply this to my hair twice a week - this a great solution for dry/damaged hair as coconut oil absorbs well into the hair shaft. Be careful, especially those with acne prone skin, wipe away excess from your hairline and wrap your head up if you decide to use this overnight treatment - I even place a towel over my pillow for extra protection.*Skin*Usually after a bath I apply some type of bath oil. Unfortunately, I had ran out and this was next best thing. This will leave your skin soft and smooth. However, be sure no to apply too much - use sparingly. It also works great for massages.I would recommend this oil to those looking for a high quality all purpose organic coconut oil.",5
"Recently my chiropractor and massage therapist both were telling me the health benefits of coconut oil, including being antibacterial and antifungal, and aiding in heart and digestive health. Not knowing any better, I purchased a tub of ""coconut oil"" at the supermarket.  It was extremely gloppy and had an overpowering coconut smell.  After doing some research, I learned the importance of getting extra virgin, organic, cold pressed oil.  I bought a competing product here on Amazon.  It was certainly better than the supermarket brand and I was reasonably satisfied with it, but wanted to compare to other brands.This Viva brand coconut oil is exactly what I was looking for!  The texture is smooth and silky, it has a delicate aroma and subtle flavor that suggest fresh coconuts, but aren't overpowering.  As recommended by my chiropractor, I have been taking a tablespoon each day, straight, for its health benefits.  It is really quite delicious.I have been cooking with it instead of other oils or butter. The food comes out delicious, and it can withstand enough heat to use in my wok without getting smokey (unlike olive oil).  I have substituted this coconut oil in baking, with very tasty results.  My husband HATES the taste of coconut, but he has not had any complaints about anything I have cooked with this oil, so in food, the flavor is subtle and pretty neutral.I'm also using it on my skin with excellent moisturizing results. The smooth texture of this oil makes a wonderful massage oil, and soaks in well enough that you don't feel greasy afterward.All in all, I am very satisfied with this product and I will certainly be purchasing more of it in the future and recommending it to others.",5
"Apparently you can use coconut oil for everything, even living forever. Okay, maybe not, but it is quite versatile.  I received a sample from the manufacturer for the purpose of review, and I used it mostly for cooking and baking.  I am not going to make any claims about the health benefits or how well it prevents certain diseases.  However, I did do all my cooking and baking with Viva Labs Coconut Oil and it is great for that purpose.  I was worried that it wouldn't work as well as the oil and butter that I usually use, but it actually worked almost exactly the same way.  I just swapped the oil or margarine in the recipe for the coconut oil and I didn't have any issues.  I liked knowing that it was organic and unrefined.I could definitely smell the coconut in our food, but it didn't taste that much different.  Every now and again I got a slight taste of coconut, but generally our food all tasted basically the same as it did before.  The thing I loved the most about it was the smell.  It's definitely the yummiest smelling oil I've ever used.I would recommend this oil if you are looking for a healthier, unrefined alternative to traditional cooking oils.  The oil is a solid rather than a liquid.  It melts easily and is very versatile.  There are several books on the uses and benefits of coconut oil that would be great to read if you are thinking of making the switch.",5
"I love this Coconut Oil and the price is amazing!  We use it for smoothies and cooking and it is the best I have tried!  Amazon Prime rocks and so does this great product!  Much thanks from Michigan, where organic is hard to find~~",5
"I have extremely dry skin and have been buying a product costing me $24 per jar.  After getting this product and realizing it could be used topically and internally, I tried it on my very dry arms and legs.  What can I say but IT'S AMAZING.When I first got the product, the first thing I did was take a teaspoon and try it.  It was creamy white and had a mild coconut taste (something I love, by the way).  Later that night, I cooked coconut shrimp in it.  The finished shrimp were golden brown, the oil had not burned, and after tossing it in the shredded coconut, it made for a most awesome dish.I warmed a teaspoon of it in my hands (and it liquified) and I ran it through my very thick hair.  It seemed to absorb quickly and left my hair shiny, and not greasy.I could go on and on, but I have read many of the review here and I think you can see for yourself that this is an amazing product.  I had bought coconut oil in the past, but this one contains no additives, flavors, colors or anything.  It is exactly as it says:  100% Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil ... certified organic and pure.  If I could give it 10 stars, I surely would.",5
"I don't know why this coconut oil is different.  I have another leading brand here at home to compare it to.  The main ingredients are the same.  Both are extra virgin.  Both are organic. Viva's oil states that it may contain trace amounts of sesame seed or peanuts.This oil has a very light fragrance.  It's so light I had to bring the jar up to my nose to smell it.  I will be able to use this one for my skin this winter because the smell won't overpower me like the other brand did.  The taste . . . when I was a kid they used to sell chocolate square chunks with the word ICE on the package.  When you put one in your mouth it seemed as if the chocolate was getting cold and creamy.  This is what the coconut oil was like when I tasted it, and tasted it again, and tasted it again--because it was such a neat feeling and the taste was light and enjoyable that I didn't want to stop.  The other product did not do that--it more resembled a substance like coconut flavored hydrogenated Crisco.Now I'm really happy.  I don't fry anything but once or twice a year if I can help it because I'm lousy at it.  All I have to work with is a hot plate and I'm certain that plays into the ""lousy"" part.  For the sake of the experiment I fried some chicken tonight in the coconut oil.  All I did was sprinkle a little bit of McCormick's Montreal Chicken on the chicken breast and cooked it in the oil--it came out restaurant quality. It was golden and moist. Excellent!  I never get anything that even resembles good, much less excellent.  I even put a bit of the oil in the Edward's Organic Mashed Potatoes with a little Kerry Gold butter.  Those potatoes gave off a faint smell of coconut, but I couldn't taste any flavor of it.  Somehow it enhanced the flavor of the potatoes and the butter, though, and I ended up eating the whole box (they are small boxes.)  Dinner was superb!  I had that with steamed asparagus with nothing on it.The coconut oil was offered to me in exchange for my honest opinion.  My honest opinion is that I feel quite lucky that I was offered this product because it really is good.  I will be switching to this brand now because there is nothing that I don't like about it.P.S.  I just stuck my finger in the empty pan I cooked the chicken in.  I had made a regular gravy from chicken broth and flour, plus added a bit of sherry for flavor.  After I tasted the cooked coconut oil with the chicken juices I added my chicken broth--OH WOW!  You've got to try this.  It is the best gravy I've ever tasted.  Wonderful gravy!",5
"I've used coconut oil for cooking and as a dietary supplement for some time now. Recently, I tried a bottle of Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil and have to say I was absolutely delighted with the product. As a nutritional supplement, the quality and taste alone will have me using this product over several others I have sampled. There are so many uses and health benefits to coconut oil, and a lot of them to choose from on the market. The smoothness and taste of Viva Labs' coconut oil is the best I have found so far. Would definitely recommend.",5
Had a complimentary bottle of this stuff sent to me to try out and I must say I am VERY IMPRESSED! Very clean and buttery tasting. After reading how it's manufactured I Would definitely recommend it for a friend. This is the best coconut oil I have ever used. :),5
"I received this 15 oz product free for the purpose of an honest review. All opinions are my own.I've been a user of coconut oil, from various companies, for many years. This coconut oil is one of the better ones I have used. It has a very nice coconut scent, as I would expect from ""extra virgin"". The color is very clean and white, with no bits of coconut shell in it. I used this as a ""supplement"" by adding it to my coffee each morning and in my hot cereals at breakfast. I also use it to make homemade toothpaste. It didn't last as long as I'd hoped. I would like to see a larger container for a slightly lower price.Good points:BPA free containerFree of pesticides, bleach, hexane and trans fatsCertified organic and non-GMOUnrefined, extra virgin, cold-pressedGood source Medium Chain TriglyceridesSuitable for vegansThings to be aware of:This brand has a warning ""may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts"".Coconut oil is liquid at temperatures above 76*FCoconut oil is solid at temperatures below 76*FIt is suitable for cooking up to temperatures of 350*FIt is a product of the Philippines",5
"I just received this Coconut Oil and so far I love the smell and the feel.  I have been using a different one and the Viva brand feels slightly thicker and has a more true coconut smell but not overpowering.  I have some excema that I am using it on and I am currently having a flare up, but with this coconut oil it seems to be clearing up faster.  Plus I am also having a tablespoon a day to hopefully aleviate some candida inside my system.",5
"When I first opened up this bottle of coconut oil, I was amazed at the delicious smell of the coconut.  I tasted it and liked the mild flavor and then I used some in not only some body products that I make but in cooking as well.  It is wonderfully smooth and delightful to use.  I love the fact that it is organic and Non-GMO.  I would highly recommend using this for whatever you use coconut oil for.",5
"I am a soap maker and used Viva Labs Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in some recent batches of cold process soap. It is a pure, snowy white, and the resulting soap turned out very nice. I typically use a different brand of coconut oil in my soap, and I noticed that the coconut odor was stronger in this oil than in the other brand, but the coconut odor did not survive the soap-making process or interfere with the fragrances I used. I can recommend it for use in cold process soap making.",5
"This was just as I expected.  The price is great for the quality.  My only...wonder...I guess (because it's not really a gripe) is about the packaging.  I had tried another brand prior to this one that was a little bit more money and it was packaged in a glass jar, because the plastic has whatever chemicals in it that aren't good for you.  Makes sense but that got me wondering with this container...is it truly organic if you're packaging it in killer plastic.  Not to exaggerate but you know what I mean.  I'd still buy it again because it's exactly what I wanted.  Just a thought to keep in mind...glass vs. plastic and what your preferences are.",4
"I have been using Coconut Oil for cooking for a while, especially after reading a University of Kansas Medical School publication on cooking oils.  They rate Coconut Oil as the very best oil for cooking because of its qualities, to quote: ""The best oils to cook with are the ones lowest in PUFA (Polyunsaturated fatty acids). But be aware that manufacturing and extraction processes can affect the quality of the oil. Always choose organic virgin grade oil if possible. Organic Virgin Coconut Oil is widely available, and is very reasonably priced.""  This oil from Viva Labs is the first oil that is so fresh that I actually enjoy just taking a spoonful and eating it, tastes just like fresh Coconut!  I will be buying this again and again..",5
"I was most interested in Coconut Oil for what I had read about it's health benefits, but was also excited to try it for cooking, and moisturizing purposes. I just moved into a place where I do not have laundry or dishwasher setup yet, so I am washing BOTH by hand right now. This coconut oil works wonders for keeping my hands moisturized, and my nails less brittle with all of this increased stress on my skin. I have also used it in my hair for conditioning and shine (Just the VERY smallest amount. I applied it to my hands, then wiped them off well, then ran my fingers through my hair with the minimal amount of residue left. Any more and it is just too greasy, no matter what kind of oil, etc. I love the smell, and it does help my dry hair to feel and appear more healthy and shiny. The melting point is ideal for all purposes I've used it for... Just excellent. And THEN I tried to cook with it!!! It was outstanding for pancakes. It adds to the aroma, melts so smooth and even, and works like a charm. And hey, if it can help my body process the pancakes better for weight, then that's a double win! I can't wait to cook more with it, and will continue to use it for dietary and moisturizing purposes. A good value and high quality product.",5
"I started using coconut oil for skin and hair care about two years ago. I've had great results. My skin elasticity has improved, and my hair is soft and full of body. I use a mixture of coconut and olive oil as a hot oil treatment once every two weeks, and it really helps with split ends. I use it as a moisturizer and a body lotion.I have also used it to make homemade cocoa bliss, combining coconut oil, cocoa powder, and agave syrup. It is a great dairy-free butter substitute in many recipes.This coconut oil smells amazing, and melts very, very quickly. It is well worth the price, considering that it has so many uses, and a 15 oz jar is enough for quite a while, as a little goes a long way.",5
"I have to admit that I came in pretty late to the benefits of coconut oil but once I found out, I'm an advocate. I mostly use it for my dogs because a teaspoon in their food helps with their skin and coat but I do love to use it myself. I haven't cooked with it yet but I do love the taste and usually take a teaspoon a day as well. I also love how it feels on my skin; it's moisturizing but it doesn't leave my skin greasy.To make sure if this brand tasted any different I had a teaspoon of each and I can honestly say that this one was tastier than the one I already had. It was subtle, yet there was definitely a difference. This is the brand I'll buy from now on.",5
"This brand of coconut oil is 100% organic cold pressed, the only kind of coconut oil that you should use. It smells great, a light fruity smell. Tastewise, it is light as well, just a hint of coconut. Texturewise, it's an oil so it will feel oily.I won't rehash the research or benefits of using coconut oil here which can be easily found on the web. Suffice to say that this coconut can be taken internally, i.e. to be used in cooking or applied externally.Some use this as a dietary supplement, but I use it mainly as a cooking oil. It's great to use as an alternative for animal oils such as butter or lard when used in the pan. For external applications, this can be used for skin or hair care. Though I received a sample from the manufacturer for review purposes, the current price is very competitive.What I like about this brand is that it's high quality. It's USDA and CCOF certified organic and non-GMO certified. It's totally unrefined and cold pressed so you don't get any trans-fats in it. It doesn't have any impurities in it and is totally pure. I highly recommend it.",5
"Pros:This product has multiple uses. It can be used as a nourishing oil mask for you hair. It can be used as a hand cream or even in cooking.I love this oil in baking! The brownies turned out heavenly with a very light coconut aroma and taste. I also baked a pastry with apples in it & it tasted great as well!According to the manufacturer it is completely natural, which is nice to know that I'm not putting in extra junk into my body.The oil has a consistency of a very soft, white soapy cream but can be solid if your home temperature drops or you keep it in the fridge.It has a very nice, light, pleasant aroma.The jar is surprisingly quite hefty and has a good amount of coconut oil in it.It could be a good moisturizer for your feet in the long run.Easy to open/close & take it out with a spoon or small spatular.Cons:It feels too oily/greasy as a moisturizer for hands and although I've used it for 3-4 days constantly it didn't moisturize as well as my regular hand cream. Imagine putting olive oil on your hands. Although the coconut oil is not that liquid at all, it's still the oil.I live in Florida, so it's soapy, semi solid.I've tried it on my hair once as a mask but I think there are better hair products out there to fit the purpose.So, I'd use it for cooking and baking for the most part. sort of expensive though but i think it's worth it.",4
"Awesome product! While researching my latest book, I was introduced to this delicious stuff. I'm not sure how it might appear in the final edit, but this coconut oil played a big part in my weight loss.What's this about a book? I thought this was a coconut oil review?I tend to get distracted. A lot. Good oil, good book, too. It's called: Eating My Words. How I Lost 20 pounds in 4 Weeks Learning How to Type. Damn Funny. Seriously.It follows How I Wrote 2 eBooks in 21 Days; Damn Funny. Seriously. Thanks for asking.Grab a jar of this stuff, make a coconut oil omelet, smear some on your skin (the oil, not the omelet) and enjoy the book.",5
"I've been using coconut oil for about a year, after learning of its health benefits. My first purchase was an organic coconut oil I found at my local grocery store. And although I liked it just fine, I've discovered that the Viva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a superior product.Viva is smoother and creamier. I love the way it glides on my skin and leaves it silky soft. I often receive compliments on my hands, which defy my middle age. I also use it to moisten the ends of my long hair. I simply rub a quarter-size amount between my palms and then massage it into my hair. I go about my housework, then shower and wash my hair. Voil--the cure to dry ends!I've used Viva coconut oil in baking cake and chocolate chip cookies. I substitute half the oil the recipe calls for with Viva that has been melted in the microwave. The finished baked product comes out the same and no one can tell the difference, except we know it is a healthier treat.I also use Viva for sauting vegetables and frying homemade hash brown potatoes. It's wonderful for just about anything you want to cook in your frying pan. I also prefer the coconut oil over butter for popcorn. I use about two tablespoons in my air popper and fine salt. It's delicious and better for you!I love that it is certified organic and pure. This is my new go-to coconut oil. It is superior to what I found at the grocery store. I suggest picking up two jars: one for the kitchen and one to use for skin and hair.",5
"Coconut oil is one of my favorite products to use on my hair and this one will definitely be on my list of must-haves! I usually moisturize my hair and then use the oil -or- I will use the oil on my fingers as I take down my twists (after they have dried). I love the results either way. After using, my hair is soft and a bit more manageable. I like that it adds a bit of a shine without a greasy feel to my hair. It does not weigh down curls, which is plus. It is definitely a light oil that seems to add a bit of moisture. Will definitely use again!",5
"As a long time Nutiva Coconut oil user I really doubted that I could find something that was as good while still being budget friendly.  Then Viva Labs contacted me about reviewing their product.It came in a plastic jar almost identical to the small Nutiva jar, but when I opened the jar, I could see a difference right away.  The consistency was much creamer looking, yet it still had that wonderful coconut smell (and taste). While the Nutiva occasionally would get tiny 'chunks', Viva Labs was like silk. This made it so much easier for mixing with essential oils for homemade natural beauty products for skin and hair.It had the same great taste when cooking, but out-performed the Nutiva when making a healthy alternative to fudge.I was really amazed at what a big difference the smoother, creamier consistency had in many of the applications I use it for.  And it's still budget friendly.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is the fact that it doesn't come in more sizes or give the opportunity to purchase in two packs for a little bit of a savings over purchasing separately the way Nutiva does.  I really hope Viva Labs will consider doing so!",4
I really love this product for my skin.  and the fact they are certified by the Non-GMO Project makes it 1000x's better.  I love the way it makes my skin feels and it smells great!,5
"I am in love with this coconut oil. I use it to moisturize my scalp and to make my hair look shiny and healthy. It was definitely worth purchasing, but I do with the container was bigger.",5
"I received a jar of this coconut oil to review. I have used coconut oil for several years now and it is a regular staple in my kitchen and bathroom. I only use coconut or olive oil--the truly natural and healthy oils. I fry hashbrowns and eggs and saut kale with it. I saut onions in it for a base for soup to which I add a can of coconut milk (full fat), chicken broth and then whatever veggies I have on hand then when done blend it into a creamy soup. It is delicious. I add a teaspoon to my coffee every morning. Yummy and so good for you. I have discovered that coconut oil is a good eye make-up remover and moisturizer as well. My skin seems to love the naturalness of it. So, when I got the Viva product I was quite pleased. I have not tried it for my hair but reading one of the previous reviews has intrigued me so I will probably try that as well soon. The consistency of the Viva here in NC in October is a mixture of solid and liquid as opposed to another coconut oil I have which is solid at this temperature. Therefore that makes me think the Viva is truly organic and purer which is something I really like. I also love the fact that it is organic and Non-GMO. I highly recommend this product.",5
"Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilViva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilYUMMM!  The first thing one notices upon opening this is the delectable aroma of fresh coconut emanating up from the snow-white coconut oil.  Absolutely heavenly.  So, I close it up for the moment, it is time to make dinner, no time for fun, but I begin thinking about how I will use this.  I have a cake in mind, maybe some cookies, some new flatbread I want to try. Oh, cake - some almond flavoring, little sugar and flour, eggs, coconut milk or water and this lovely product!Today I made the cake, a HUGE cake using this coconut oil as my base.  While it was baking, I made a glaze, again using 3 T. of this with some almond flavor, coconut water and powdered sugar.  When the cake was done, I let it cool for a bit and then glazed it. Of course I had to sample it.  I am serving it for company tomorrow.  It is PERFECT!  I LOVE this product.  It is easy to work with, smells and tastes like coconut, and is the perfect ingredient for most of my baking.  My recommendation is 5+ stars.  Try it, I think you will like it!",5
"I like to use coconut oil for frying and occasionally, baking. It has a light enough flavor that it doesn't taint foods, and is considered a healthy fat recommended even for those on a diet. I've read that it can withstand higher temperatures than many other cooking oils, and is the healthiest fat for frying.For me the bottom line is taste, if I don't like how something tastes, I don't care how healthy it is or how nasty the alternative. Coconut oil is right up there with extra virgin olive oil and butter as far as taste is concerned.When I got this in the mail I tried it out on a batch of perogies, frying them up with coconut oil and salt. Drop-dead heavenly delicious, better than butter. The oil didn't impart its own flavor, although there was a slight, very pleasant coconut scent. The taste was fresh and for lack of a better word, clear.I usually use Swansons coconut oil, but I'm switching to this. It smells better, tastes better, melts more smoothly, and my instincts say it's just plain better quality.It has a lovely, fresh, true coconut scent. If you like fresh coconut, you'll love how this stuff smells. Swansons brand doesn't smell nearly as good (something not as fresh coconutty about it). It's not the cheapest around, but the price gap over other brands isn't too bad. I'm not one to think that a higher price equals higher quality, but I will pay more for discernibly better quality - which this brand has.The jar was well sealed, which was welcome because I have had my former brand leak in transit. Packaged in a nice-looking, opaque plastic container that protects it from light. Melts instantly in your hands if you are using it for skin care.* I was provided with a free container for unbiased review. I post my honest opinion; if I don't like a product sent to review and would have to give a sharply negative opinion, I refrain from posting any review at all out of respect for the sender. Thus if you see a positive review from me, it's real.",5
"I've used the whole jar in about a week. I used it for cooking & I use it for my hair.Cooking, I replaced using butter and my meals come out great. There really isn't any coconut taste to the foods since it was cooked which was a plus. I made belgian waffles & slow cooked apple pie. It came out the same if I were to use butter. I like to make pina coladas (both alcoholic & virgin) & adding a scoop or two of the oil is great! I didn't tell my husband I switched the butter with the oil & he couldn't even tell at all.For beauty, I sometimes use the oil as a base before my makeup. My lips are always smooth, but I always end up licking it off because it tastes good (lol). I mix 2 parts oil & 1 part olive oil for a hair mask & leave it on for about 30 - 60 min. Double shampoo & then condition, my hair is very soft & shiny. My hair has been chemically straightened (the extreme kind; I had it done in Japan) & bleached from black to platinum white - blonde. My hair is more healthier than colleagues who haven't done jack s*** to their hair.I'm very happy with this product. If I can't find a bigger coconut oil container locally, I'll probably end up buying this again. This is so much healthier & better for you than butter/margarine or whatever. Not even for food, but it's a cheap & effective alternative for beauty as well.",5
"This is the first time I've come across coconut oil, so I was surprised to see that people use it both in cooking and for skin care. I wanted to give it a try, so I experimented in a few ways.In the kitchen, I made a maple pecan granola, adding a few tablespoons of the oil to my usual mix. The flavor was very mild, but nice. I don't like chewing bits of coconut in granola (or cookies), but I like the taste of coconut, so this is a great way to add that layer of flavor. I also added it to a hot cocoa mix I got in Mexico flavored with almonds. Winner! Really tasty! The beads of oil floating in the cocoa were a little off-putting, though. I think I might use it for frying sometime... maybe a Thai dish of some sort.As a personal product, I tried it as a moisturizer. I didn't like how greasy it was on its own, so I mixed it with a face cream that I haven't been using because of its heavy texture (Neutrogena Lift and Strengthen). I put the cream in the fridge for a few minutes to solidify the oil and help it blend in better. The end result was a good moisturizer for using on problem ares, such as elbows and feet.Since I don't watch Dr. Oz, I had to look up the supposed benefits of coconut oil. Here's what I found:1. For those concerned with its organic bona fides, it's an unrefined, extra-virgin, cold-pressed non-GMO (genetically modified organism) product certified by the CCOF (California Certified Organic Farmers), free of pesticides, bleach, hexane and trans fats that is suitable for vegetarians and vegans.2. As a dietary supplement, it's supposed to help with gastric conditions, blood sugar control, lower cholesterol levels, and boost your energy level.3. As a food, it is supposed to be helpful in weight maintenance. As a medium-chain triglyceride, it is a ""good"" fat similar to olive oil that isn't easily stored in fat tissues. It is supposed to be better than long-chain triglycerides like corn oil. It is also used as a dairy free substitute in cooking.4. As a skin and hair care product, it's used as a moisturizer.5. As a health enhancer, people use it for ""oil pulling,"" which is a really freaky concept that I'm not about to try. (Swishing oil around in your mouth!)I have to say, I would not use this product for weight maintenance. I lost 30 pounds six years ago and have been maintaining my loss by carefully counting calories. For me, a calorie is a calorie is a calorie. According to the label, coconut oil has 125 calories per tablespoon, which is higher even than butter (100 calories), and I use Smart Balance Light, which has only 50 calories per tablespoon. Olive oil is similar to coconut oil, with 120 calories per tablespoon. I also see from the label that it is primarily a saturated fat.All in all, I would use this product as a moisturizer and in cooking when I wanted a subtle hint of coconut flavor. (Though it's bad for me in that the aroma of it makes me want to add rum and pineapple juice!)",5
"I just got a tub of this coconut oil, and I think it is absolutely delicious. The flavor is fresh and tropical and the texture is silky. I'm a protein type, so when I'm hungry I need something like NOW! Instead of making for the peanut butter, and I find that a spoonful of this oil calms down the urge to binge, and the fact that it is healthy and thermogenic (fat-burning) is a big bonus.I've been using coconut oil for years for cooking and baking, and whereas some oils have a rancid or strange smell when heated, the Viva oil remains delicately aromatic, even when frying at high temperatures.I was pleased to see that it is both organic and non-GMO. I had been concerned of late to read of the GM research to develop pest-resistant and high lauric acid strains of coconut. We don't want this healthy food to go the way of the soybean, where today some 90% are genetically modified, and linked to a litany of health and social disasters.",5
"I've read a lot of claims about coconut oil recently and wanted to get this item into my diet. So, I tried this product and another similarly priced (though slightly less expensive) oil. I really like it. The flavor is rich but subtle. It does not overwhelm food. So I started by frying everything from vegetable stir-fry dishes to chicken pieces in this coconut oil with great results.Also, I add about a teaspoon to my daily blender drink. I'll start with a little juice---orange, grapefruit, grape whatever I have. To that I'll add a couple carrots, an apple, a banana and some spinach. (Note: I just dump in anything I have---all the fruits and vegetables makes nice drinks in a basic blender) To this I'll add a teaspoon of coconut oil. Now, this may be simply adding calories of fat or I may be adding some health benefit. I can't say if I notice much difference in health but the coconut oil does add flavor to the juice and I know I'm getting it ""untainted"" by heat.This is a great product and I will certainly buy it from Amazon regularly as the price here is far below what my rural market offers. I look forward to larger containers---perhaps a quart?I also keep a separate jar in the bathroom to use as I might any moisturizer. Chapped lips? It helps. Cracked elbows? It works and it certainly superior to a chemical and it smells nice. It also absorbs quickly so there is no greasy feeling.This product gets an A+ from me.",5
"My cousin told me she uses organic coconut oil for her skin and she said her skin glows.  So I thought I would give it a try.  After every use I can see great results and she was right, my skin glows.  It's great for sun dried skin.",5
Love the texture of this coconut oil and the size of the jar is perfect.  It's easy to reach the bottom of this jar versus the tall ones where it's hard to get to the bottom of the container.  I will definitely order it again.  Next time I will order two so that I can have one in the kitchen and one in the powder room!,5
"I've ordered coconut oil fairly regularly over the years.  This product was not only superior in quality but the packaging was leak-proof and damage resistant.  The price was slightly less than my local natural food store and, with Prime's two day shipping, this is the only way to go for coconut oil.  It's worth noting that I've started to use more oil due to a friend's recommendation concerning the ancient practice of ""oil pulling"".",5
"Fantastic stuff! I'd been using Nutiva 54oz jars of coconut oil, so the small portable size of this coconut oil is a lot more convenient for traveling with or keeping under the bathroom sink for convenient use on my skin.I stopped using soaps and chemicals and stuff on my skin and began washing my face and body with coconut oil daily about a year and a half ago. instantly my face was in love with it, soaked up every last bit. I continued and maintained use and my 8 year battle with cystic acne ended.You can also cook with it, it makes a really delicious baked chicken c: and taking the coconut internally will give you health benefits very quickly in your gastrointestinal tract and become absorbed by your body as a good fat that will help your body absorb vitamins more completely. I don't cook with any vegetable oils other than coconut and olive, and I've obtained a really nice slim figure after having cut out canola oil and stuff.Protip for use on skin:use only coconut oil and water and steam, no facewash or bodywash or soap.use steam cleansing method and rub the oil into your pores deeply, massaging with your freshly washed hands.take a long time to do it. massage the oil into your face while you're on the couch listening to music.put too much on and go outside during a hot/warm humid day and massage it into your skin.this oil will replace the oils that are already in your skin; the oils coming from the skin are dirty and require proper maintenance for optimal skin health.",5
"I've used other coconut oils before, but this has to be my favorite. It's smooth and the smell isn't overwhelming. It's a part of my daily routine when it comes to oil pulling, moisturizing my hair, my skin and cooking!",5
"Ever since I found out that olive oil is not the best oil to cook with, I have been using coconut oil. Coconut oil can be heated to very high temperatures without the worry of the oil becoming toxic. Plus, coconut oil has a lot of health and beauty benefits.I was so excited to try Viva Labs coconut oil because I am always on the lookout for a better coconut oil. Before Viva Labs, I have used one sold by Costco and Nutiva. All three are premium coconut oils, with Viva Labs and Nutiva being superior to the brand from Costco and several other cheaper brands I have tried and returned.If you don't like the taste of coconut oil, then my advice for you is to try to get use to it. I had a hard time with coconut oil in the beginning because I was so used to olive oil. However, now I cannot even taste it when I make eggs, stir fries, and more. I do notice that if I saut spinach in coconut oil, it comes out a little sweeter than I like, so I just steam my spinach instead.Two of my favorite treats with Viva Labs coconut oil are sweet potato fries and skinny Reese's. Sweet potatoes and coconut oil go together like PB&J.; It is amazing! Just slice up your clean sweet potato, drizzle some coconut oil on them, bake them, and add a little salt. Heaven!For the skinny chocolate, I mix coco powder and Truvia in coconut oil (when its in liquid form) until I have the chocolate taste I want. Then I add a little bit of peanut butter into a muffin cup, add the coconut chocolate on top, and freeze. My mouth is drooling just talking about it.I have used Viva Labs coconut oil for lotion too and love that it does not feel as greasy as the other oils, and it smells good too. Oh, and I use coconut oil as a makeup remover for stubborn eye makeup too. Works like a charm!Coconut oil is a must-have in my household - both for the kitchen and the bathroom.I received a sample of the coconut oil from Viva Labs, but it has definitely became one of my favorite coconut oils to use.",5
"I only received the package in the last week, but I've been really enjoying the product thus far. It's delicious all by itself and is great to cook with - it even leaves a subtle coconut aroma in the air. I'd highly recommend Viva Labs Coconut Oil to anyone looking for a healthier, tastier oil for both cooking and dry skin relief.",5
"Over the past year I have become a big fan of coconut for the health benefits. I have enjoyed this coconut oil for cooking, and it is fantastic! I have not yet tried it for other uses yet, but have read many other recommended uses for it online (making your own sunscreen, moisturizer, etc.) I am very glad I tried this product, as it is very high quality. For the small tub and an organic product the price is reasonable, in comparison to a grocery store or health food store. However, if your biggest concern is value, I am able to buy larger volume for significantly less through my local warehouse (not the same product, but very similar good quality, organic.) Overall, I do highly recommend this product!",5
"I have used extra virgin, organic coconut oil for some time and prefer buying it on Amazon because it is much less expensive than in the grocery store in those little jars! It can be one of the Most Useful products to have around your house and this VIVA Brand is absolutely DELICIOUS as well! Great consistency too! Easy to use and spread on toast and other things! Great price!People have often admired my skin and I use coconut oil in place of any kind of creams or lotions.  I put some in a small jar I carry in my swim bag!  I often put in on after showering before bedtime. The natives of many different cultures where coconuts grew and who have beautiful skin, used just plain coconut oil!You can use it to fry and saute foods and it is highly recommended! You can substitute it in recipes for butter. It is is simply very, very versatile!One of my favorite things to make, and I don't use a recipe for, is my own chocolate!! Better than store bought. I gently melt a little coconut oil by itself, or half oil half butter in a small pan. When just melted, I add a sweetener of choice, like Yacon Syrup, honey, maple, coconut sugar. Choose which one you like and add about 2/3's what you added of the melted oil and stir well. Then beat in some organic, good quality cocoa powder, about the same amount as the melted oil (or oil and butter together). Add a dash of vanilla. One tiny, tiny pinch of salt if you wish and VOILA! It is SO delicious you won't need to eat it all at once!! Like chocolate was meant to be!! Store room temperature or in the fridge and make dozens of things with it!  Add some ground almond flour for some raw brownies. Add mint extract if you like that! I also add chopped nuts and coconut and roll it into balls. Or omit the chocolate powder and just add the almond flour and dried fruits like pineapple and coconut or dried apples raisins and cinnamon! I LOVE coconut oil. You can make the Yummiest things! They get more solid when chilled and there is NO cooking needed! Your children will LOVE you!! Also, if this is too intense, you can add some organic milk powder for a more milk chocolate taste! You will love this product and continue to find Many Uses for it!",5
"I received a free sample of this product in the mail. Others have left some pretty thorough reviews so I'll keep it short: In the categories of taste, smell and even consistency, this product is superior to the organic brand we're currently using.I know that some people consume coconut oil by the spoonful as a supplement (instead of just using it for cooking) and I think this product would be ideal for that. It has a very light and ""clean"" feel to it; the smell and taste of coconut is faint but not entirely absent.Again, this is definitely a higher quality product than the organic / ""extra-virgin"" coconut oil that we buy in 54 oz containers. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because of the price. (Ounce for ounce, it's about 50% more expensive than the brand we're currently using.)",4
"I've used this coconut oil for roasting veggies (1/2 olive oil, 1/2 coconut oil), in place of butter for sauteing onions, on my skin (all over), and in my hair, as a conditioner. That is covers so many uses is really great. I'll keep trying new things and keep you posted! Love that it's organic, too.",5
"I have to say I wasn't too sure about coconut oil on my hair. I did try it today though and I am impressed.  My hair is super soft and not frizzy. There is a very soft coconutty smell and I do prefer this to a stronger perfume smell.So, the hair test was a success and it also wasn't too greasy on my hands either.Next I thought, wouldn't some popcorn taste good? I put some coconut oil in a pan, heated it up and then poured in some popcorn.  A few minutes later we were enjoying our popcorn. The coconut oil gave it a light taste that I like better than the coconut oil at the movie theatre.I am excited about trying this in baking now.  I have become a fan.If you like soft hair and skin and yummy popcorn, this is the product for you.",5
"I use coconut oil as the sole moisturizer for my face (and given how dry and sensitive my skin is, I use it twice a day, every day). I thought all coconut oil was created the same, until I tried this one. The melt point is very low, I assume owing to its purity, and it wasn't at all waxy. It applied smoothly and evenly, absorbing right in. It also smelled heavenly! I'd never had a brand of coconut oil that smelled like fresh coconut before, so that was a pleasant surprise. The container is enormous, given how little I use with each application, so this will last me a very long time. I imagine it's wonderful for cooking....but it's too awesome as a moisturizer for me to ""waste"" any in cooking. Given all the amazing healthful properties of coconut that I keep reading about, I might need to start eating it as well as applying it topically. I've definitely found my favorite brand though, and consider myself spoiled on high-quality coconut oil from now on.",5
"Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilI received this coconut oil within 3 days of ordering it.i've been using only coconut oil for more than 2 years.It's very fresh, organic, and it had a better price than all the other oils!I've shared it with my health minded friends and look forward to ordering it again.thank you Viva!",5
"I tried the Viva Labs coconut oil to fry my ""crunchy"" style pancakes. This oil made them even better than all the other oils I have tried in 3 years of making this fantastic breakfast. The smell is fantastic. My wife broils and pan fries gourmet fish fillets and the texture and cookablity of this oil is superb...making fish taste even better than with just coconut flakes for breading. All the ""healthy"" components and certifications seem to be in order so I recommend this oil as a replacement for most if not all other cooking oils for home use.",5
"I was given a jar of this and I absolutely will be purchasing again. Ive never purchased for use but after using it to combat itchiness and a rash, I can agree that it does have beneficial multi-uses other than cooking.  My jar content came solid but is now liquid.  Maybe my home is warm. It smells great.very strong coconut scent. I plan to cook with it next.",5
"I have only recently started using more coconut oil, due to the many health benefits it has. Although it can be quite expensive to purchase from some sources, I was impressed at the reasonable price for this Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil from VivaLabs. Our local grocery store's price is quite a bit higher.A friend told me they use coconut oil to make popcorn, (in the kettle style). I tried regular coconut oil, (not extra virgin), to make popcorn, and was not that impressed. Then I tried this from VivaLabs - it made a big difference! With the mild coconut flavor adding a touch of sweetness, it was delicious!I also used it for a cookie dough truffle recipe I found on Pinterest. Very good in that too. Next I want to bake some chocolate chip cookies with it - I'm sure they will be extra tasty, plus healthy! I especially love that this oil is certified organic and completely pure. It gives me complete confidence in using it. I plan on continuing to get my coconut oil from VivaLabs!",5
"I've used Nutiva and Vitacost coconut oil for a long time, so I was happy to try a free sample of Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil when it was offered to me.I use coconut oil in place of regular oil in baking and frying, as a deep conditioner on my hair, and also as a body lotion. Compared to canola oil (processed with hexane), corn oil (always GMO) and shortening (usually hydrogenated), coconut oil is a natural, healthy oil that's actually good for you. I also like that coconut oil has a very long shelf life, so I can stock up when I find a good price or a superior product and not worry about it going rancid before I finish it.Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is probably the best of the coconut oils I've used. It's cold pressed and un-refined, which preserves all the nutrients, and it's organic so I don't have to worry about pesticides or bleaching. But the reason I like it so much is that it's delicious! I ate a teaspoon of it right out of the jar, and it has a wonderful aroma and flavor. I applied some to my body after my shower last night, and went to bed smelling like the tropics, with nicely moisturized skin.It's competitively priced with the famous brands, and I will be looking for it when this jar is gone. Five stars!",5
"We are using virgin coconut oil as an alternative to lotion specially during the dry winter season. We have already tried a couple more different brands and this is as good if not better than the others. It does prevent chappy and dry skin throughout the day. I just use a little dab, just enough to cover the skin. It will be absorbed after a few minutes and would not notice it is there including the coconut oil smell.Cons:the only con I can think of is more of a subjective matter. Coconut oil is fragrant, it is just not the kind of smell that you would expect from a regular lotion.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.",5
"I'm loving this product! Having used many different things like Argan oil, Olive oil, coco butter, vitamin E oil on my face and body as moisturizers, it starting to get a little expensive. Loving what Coconut Oil is doing for my body. Elbows, Knees, Feet and neck are all pretty soft and smooth after a week or so.Deducting 1 star due to the smell, it's not a strong smell, but I'm personally used to more artificial fragrances. Found that after applying it, then going to workout, the scent was just not refreshing, but rather a little stuffy (if that makes sense).Completely impressed with the multitude of uses the coconut oil has, can't wait to keep trying new things with it!",4
"For full disclosure, I was approached by Viva Labs to review a complimentary, full size, offering of this product based on a review I posted for a similar item. Since we use a lot of coconut oil in our household for cooking as a dairy replacement, I was both intrigued and highly skeptical. Still, I'm always down to try something new and provide a non-biased review.I received my package in the month of September but it was still warm enough in the delivery truck that the typically solid coconut oil in the container had liquified. Of course, many people who use coconut oil often will note that this happens every now and again when left to sit in the pantry between uses on warm days. (The packaging for this product specifies that this will occur at 76 degrees F/24 degrees C.) The container arrived in good condition, with no leaks, and I set it on the counter overnight to rest. The next day the oil had reverted back to a nice creamy solid, much like butter, and has remained solid for the duration of my ownership. I mention this because coconut oil is used as a butter replacement in many cases: over popcorn, spread on toast, sauteing, baked potatoes, you name it; and is most easily handled by use of a spoon or butter knife, in my experience, and not when in a liquified state. (I should also note that you can force it to solidify on warm days by putting it in the fridge, it's really not a big deal. I just thought it was worth mentioning.)As for the quality, I was sincerely taken aback by the pleasant aroma of this brand of coconut oil and the creamy consistency it has maintained since I opened the container. I can't overstate how creamy it has been. In fact, I find it quite edible straight from the spoon. Both the aroma and taste is amazing.As other reviewers have stated, this size of product and price doesn't evenly compare with bulk purchases at warehouse superstores (which is also how we have procured our steady supply since our initial forays into widespread use of coconut oil when we learned about food sensitivities in our home). But I suppose that should also be weighed against the availability of bulk-sized options for the individual buyer. The easy question would be whether I would choose this brand over our everyday-use brand, to that the answer would be yes. Viva Labs would be my product of choice to date.It's hard to find fault in a product as good for you as coconut oil. It is both very nutritious and adds great flavor to recipes. But even more than that, it can also be great for your skin and hair. I've never personally used coconut oil as a hair conditioner, but I can attest to the benefits and pleasantness of using it as a skin moisturizer. This brand is great for both cooking and skincare, in my experience, and I would not hesitate to give it a solid recommendation. We do go through enough coconut oil to justify bulk purchases, so I would love to size and pricing options that meet my needs. If you're just starting your foray into coconut oil use, give this brand a try.** This product is produced in a facility that handles tree nuts, sesame seeds, and peanuts -- please take note of this if there is a food allergy to one or more of those items in your household. **",5
"It only took me one use of Viva Labs Coconut Oil to notice the significant difference between the others I've tried. I've tried Nutiva's, Barlean's, the Whole Foods brand, and Trader Joes. Viva Labs oil has the best aroma and gives food a beautiful creamy texture unlike any other.Coconut Oil isn't always my oil of choice to use when cooking, sometimes I use olive oil.. but after trying the Viva Labs oil, I crave food with the coconut taste and have almost finished my first container.",5
"VIva Labs organic, unrefined, cold-pressed or extra virgin coconut oil comes in a white food-safe #2 HDPE jar that protects the contents from light and isn't dangerous if dropped.  It contains 15 oz. of excellent quality oil with a fresh tropical coconut smell and a light taste of coconut.This coconut oil is the best way to start off a curry and is excellent for pan frying as it has a high smoke point. Try browning rice in it before boiling.  It makes a good substitute for some of the butter in certain recipes:  half and half in Bananas Foster or use oil for a quarter of the butter when baking scones to give them a delightful fragrance and just a hint of coconut flavor as well as to improve the crumb.  A spoonful gives a smoothie a nice mouthfeel and it can be spread on toast.I like to dab a little on my elbows and knees whenever I have the jar out and have heard that it can be used as a pomade and as an edible massage oil.  Be aware that if used on the body, cats will lick it.Keep coconut oil refrigerated after opening to help it stay fresh unless the jar will be used within a couple of months.  It solidifies below room temperature but can be scooped out with a metal spoon or knife.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review.",5
"After reading the book ""The New Arthritis Cure""  I knew that I needed this product.  It smells wonderful and has just a very mild coconut flavor.  I have been cooking all of my meals with it and also putting it in to my tea and coffee.  Thank you for this wonderful product, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in improving their general health.",5
"I am not normally a user of coconut oil for my skin and hair, but when I had the opportunity to try this I jumped for it, because the other sorts of oils which have recently become popular can be not only pricey (as I saw at the mall on Friday) but not always as pure.This coconut oil is organic ( I know that is an overused word but it is a valid word when used properly), Extra Virgin, and super for your skin and hair! You can even try it for eczema and for smoothing scars. Just be careful if you have oily skin or hair, which I don't, or clogged pores, which it is NOT recommended for, as a face treatment. For a face treatment, it is recommended for specific areas, such as under your eyes, where the skin can get very very dry (and is, in my case).I mainly wanted to try this coconut oil as a moisturizer and conditioner for my hair.As many of you are aware, I adore beauty products and I am ever holding an eternal search for the wonderful product which will tame my disastrous hair.  My hair is over processed, fine, brittle and dry. It is, in short, in as bad shape as hair can get.One thing I noticed about Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is that it arrived attentively packaged, and promptly. So there are no concerns about the US Mail or UPS guy getting your spa treatment or cooking oil intended for you ( meaning, by accidental leaking through the box. And yes!!! I have been there!).The next thing I noticed was that there are no instructions for use for Viva. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING.Why? Because all you have to do is google or use another search engine to look up ""how to use coconut oil"". Make sure you are not hitting an advertisement. Then follow the easy instructions on how to use this oil in solid or liquid form on your hair, legs , under your eyes and so on.I did that and it worked out very well for me.I am a vegetarian, incidentally, and moving toward becoming Vegan. Coconut oil is a popular oil for use by many many vegetarians and Vegans. This oil is USDA certified. This is good. Better, it specifically claims to be non GMO. Hello? This is good and IMPORTANT!As for me, I myself am only interested in cooking with coconut oil with some reservations. This is because some of my friends are moving away from almost ALL oils in cooking. However this is a personal choice at this point.  I know  and acknowledge from my background in nutrition that olive oil is an excellent addition in a very small amount to a person's vegan or low fat diet.And keeping all that in mind, if I were to cook with coconut oil, THIS is the one I WOULD USE.  So there you go.In the long run read someone else's review for use of this oil in cooking.As this review comes to this point, in conclusion:For the purposes of this review, if you were to ask me, ""Would you recommend this oil as a reasonably priced, properly processed, environmentally conscious oil which is an effective skin and hair care product?"", I would absolutely respond, ""YES!""Now go forth and try this! I double dare you to get hair as pretty and soft and smooth as mine is, NOW, after trying Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil !  A big A+ and five stars for this product!Thanks!jean",5
"Well, the wife and I have been using coconut oil for about a year. I think it was Dr. Mercola who tuned us into investigating and using coconut oil for its many health benefits. You can google for a list of benefits and other reviewers on Amazon have done a pretty good job of outlining most of the benefits so I am not going into all that again.I am a guy and I do not like to put greasy ""stuff"" on my face or hair. So, I do not use it as a moisturizer or in my hair. We use it only for eating. So, that is where I will concentrate my opinions.So, we use coconut oil for its health benefits from eating it, although I have put some on cuts and scratches and found it to be very soothing. It seems to aid healing. I have never gotten an infection from any cut after putting a little coconut oil on it with a bandage and the cuts heal fast.There is a misconception that coconut oil is not good for heart health. This is because it contains a large quantity of saturated fats. In reality, coconut oil is beneficial for the heart. It contains about 50% lauric acid, which helps in actively preventing various heart problems like high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure. The saturated fats present in coconut oil are not harmful as you commonly find in vegetable oils. Coconut oil does not lead to increase in LDL levels, and it reduces the incidence of injury and damage to arteries and therefore helps in preventing atherosclerosis.Coconut oil is also good for the immune system. I have read that it strengthens the immune system because it contains antimicrobial lipids, lauric acid, capric acid and caprylic acid which have antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties.According to the Coconut Research Center:""The vast majority of the fats and oils you eat, whether they are saturated or unsaturated or come from an animal or a plant, are composed of long-chain triglycerides. Probably 98 to 100% of all the fats we eat consist of LCT. Coconut oil is unique because it is composed predominately of MCT. The size of the fatty acid is extremely important because physiological effects of medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are distinctly different from the long-chain fatty acids more commonly found in our diet. It's the MCT in coconut oil that make it different from all other fats and for the most part gives it its unique character and healing properties. Almost all of the medium-chain triglycerides used in research, medicine, and food products come from coconut oil.""""Have you or someone you know ever been in a serious car accident? I mean serious enough that you had to be rushed to the hospital and spend time in the intensive care unit. Or maybe you've come down with a life-threatening illness. Or perhaps due to age you've been hospitalized to treat some degenerative condition. In any of these situations, whether you lived or died depended on the care you received in the hospital. Often this required you to be fed intravenously or through a tube. In the intensive care unit there would be others, some suffering from complications from genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or epilepsy and perhaps even premature infants struggling to survive their first few weeks of life. In each of these cases you and these other patients can give some of the credit for your recovery to coconut oil. Yes, in one form or another, coconut oil was part of your treatment.""""Regardless of the condition, recovery requires good nutrition. Food scientists have long noted the nutritional benefits of medium-chain triglycerides. MCT from coconut oil are used in hospital formulas to feed the very young, the critically ill, and those who have digestive problems. It makes up a vital part of the solutions fed to patients intravenously or through a tube inserted down the throat. If you were ever given formula as a baby you took advantage of the health-promoting properties of coconut oil. MCT from coconut oil have been added to baby formula for decades.""""MCT are easily digested, absorbed, and put to use nourishing the body. Unlike other fats, they put little strain on the digestive system and provide a quick source of energy necessary to promote healing. This is important for patients who are using every ounce of strength they have to overcome serious illness or injury. It's no wonder why MCT are added to infant formulas. Actually, whether you were breast or formula fed as an infant you consumed MCT. Why? Because MCT are not only found in coconut oil but are natural and vital components of human breast milk. MCT are considered essential nutrients for infants as well as for people with serious digestive problems like cystic fibrosis. Like other essential nutrients, you must get them directly from the diet.""""One of the first scientifically recognized benefits of MCT is the unique manner in which they are digested and utilized by the body. These fats provide nutritional benefits that can improve overall health of both the sick and the well, the young and the old. Even athletes are now using them to boost performance and control weight. Unfortunately, few foods nowadays contain MCT; the best source is coconut oil. By adding coconut oil to your diet you can literally eat your way to better health.""So, it is information like this that got us to buying coconut oil and using it for baking/frying. For a newcomer, you will notice the coconut flavor right away when you bake or fry with it. It takes some getting used to. Now that we have been using it for a while, we have gotten to like it. I like to buy the 32-oz size when I buy it in the store because we go through it pretty fast and bigger is better. Most coconut oils taste about the same so we just look for the best buys. Most of the coconut oils I run across say they are organic and virgin. So, it comes down to which we like the taste of best and how expensive it is. I don't always go for cheap - I have to like the taste too.I received a 15-oz. container from Viva Labs free in return for an honest review. I was able to do a side-by-side test of this brand and a couple others I have in the house.What I like about the Viva Labs coconut oil is that it seems to be lighter in the coconut flavor. It is rich and creamy and doesn't have that coconut kick that some of the other brands have. You can still taste the coconut when you fry with it, it just isn't so in-your-face. I use it to fry potatoes for breakfast as that is one of my wife's favorite breakfasts. I also use it in place of butter to make cobblers. I make a cobbler topping by mixing oats, brown sugar and coconut oil until the mix is in small crumbs and then put it on top of the fruit filling - cherries, apples, peaches, etc. The coconut flavor actually adds a lot to a cobbler. You can use it for pie crust instead of lard/crisco.Coconut oil is expensive no matter what the source. The 32-oz container I usually buy at the store runs me $35 which is over a dollar an ounce. That makes this 15-oz container from Viva Labs at under $10 a good buy.So, we have been using coconut oil for about a year now. I used to have at least one bad cold a year, an ear infection at least once a year, and usually a case of the flu or similar every year. I don't know if it is the coconut oil, but this is the first time I can remember going a whole year without ever being sick. Not a cold, not a sniffle, no sore throat, nothing. I can't say it is because of the coconut oil, but since coconut oil has become part of our lives here, we continue to use it and enjoy whatever health benefits we can gain from using it.I like this brand and will continue to use it in our household.",5
"Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is an amazing product. Versatile, it can be used in cooking and also as a beauty product. The smell is incredible, just like cracking open a fresh coconut.It is in solid form when it is cold, but melts at the touch into a wonderful oil. I have been using it as a hair mask and on the rough spots at my ankles and elbows. Even after just a few days I already see a huge difference in the texture of my skin and hair. I love that it absorbs quickly without making you feel like you have a film over your skin or grease on you.The other thing that impressed me about this product is how much you get in the container and how little it takes to do a beauty treatment. This will last for a long time. Knowing that it is organic and all natural without chemicals and artificial ingredients makes me feel better about using it.I would definitely recommend this product to other people looking for a natural beauty treatment. Excellent!",5
"After a dreadful dentist visit with potential gingivitis and the possibility of a $750 cleaning bill, I decided to try oil pulling.  I have been doing it for several days and have noticed that my teeth look great!  I am not sure how much it is helping my gums but want to keep at it for at least 2 months.  This coconut oil has a fragrant aroma and the taste isn't bad at all.  I am very pleased!",5
"I didn't know a natural product could be so good. Just the right slipperyness, which can be made more so with the occasional addition of saliva. It has the light, sweet smell of coconut oil. Clean up is nice; it washes off easily and leaves behind soft skin.I'm not a shill; read my other diverse reviews.",5
Love this product! Excellent on elbows and heels. You can even cook with it. I bought it for skin care though. Highly recommend this. Arrived very quickly too!,5
"I just purchased this coconut oil and it has a mild, good flavor, liquifies easily. At this point I find no reason not to give it a 5-star rating.",5
"I'm so happy that I ordered the Coconut Oil!  It is wonderful!First, I can read all the ingredients, it is pressed Coconut Oil - that's all.Second, I use it for my face and whole body;  but also it can be used for cooking.  Again, that is so wonderful - no chemicals on my skin.Third, it has an excellent aroma, it smells like heaven.Fourth, I use it now for almost 3 weeks and my skin feels soft and has a healthy shine.Fifths, it is inexpensive.So, if you want a excellent product dry Coconut oil and check it out for yourself.",5
"This stuff is great. Just need a little bit. Take a tiny bit of coconut and rub between palms. When it turns into oil, rub on arms, legs, face, wherever you'd like. Rub into your skin, there is no oily residue as long as you dont use too much. I use it at night only, go to bed smelling like a macaroon and wake up with soft smooth skin. I love it. for $10 a jar saves money too. A little goes a long way!",5
"Purchased this oil based on other reviews and I am very happy with it.  It smells wonderful, has a light coconut taste and was a good price.  I have one jar in my kitchen and the other in my bathroom.  I use it for cooking and smoothies but I also use it on my children's chapped winter hands, my elbows and even my face.  Highly recommend it.",5
"I love products that serve multiple purposes, and this product is nothing short of amazing! I've got some seriously dry skin, I've used this coconut oil on my hands, feet and even my lips and in one emergency, I used it on my face. Its not overly greasy and it smells great, it really helped quench my skin and provide lasting moisture. I've also used this product as part of a deep conditioning hair care routine. We like to put this in the hair for like 15-20 minutes and then rinse. Great for moisture and shine. Would highly recommend adding this to your beauty routine. You can even add this to some sugar, and create a lovely sugar scrub for your hands, feet and lips, add a bit of essential oil and you're all set. The possibilities are endless. *I received a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my thoughts, no other compensation was received.*",5
"I am brand new to the coconut is good for everything movement, but I just have to say I can't keep my hands out of this product!  I put it on my sunburned face, winter-dried fingertips and feet and lips; I have made the most amazing zucchini bread for tea that I I can enjoy without the guilt; and my very persnickety kitty will lick up any bits that escape from the container as it moves from the kitchen to the living room to the bedroom. (The olfactory reminder of pina coladas in Cabo is an added mood elevator.)  My only problem is how quickly it is disappearing...",5
"I've had this for a few weeks now and I love it. I use it primarily for oil pulling, and I just love the taste. Great product! Will definitely buy from again",5
Excellent product. Flavor is the best I have found for coconut oil.  I don't think you would be disappointed with this coconut oil.,5
"I'm currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair (3c/4a if I recall correctly). I've used this I believe for a month now and my hair seems to like it, but I haven't noticed any difference in breakage or shedding of my hair. Before using this, I used a mixture of castor oil and argon oil. Sometimes if it the air is very dry, I mix the coconut oil with some castor oil.",4
"My girlfriend loves getting massages, and until recently we were just using some simple lotion for her skin. I did some digging online and found out coconut oil can give fantastic massages, and that is most definitely true! She loves them, and it smells fantastic. I highly recommend it to couples looking for a little something extra for those special massages :D",5
"I was mailed a sample to review, and this coconut oil works just as well as the coconut oil I have been using on a regular basis. I use coconut oil daily, so I feel this oil is high quality. However, I will stick with Carrington Farms brand because it is much less expensive. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPZPYLS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00CPZPYLS&linkCode;=as2&tag;=countercultureliving-20",4
"I am hesitant on items that claim to be many things.  I've found that one size generally does not fit all.  So when I read about using coconut oil as part of a beauty regimen and for cooking, I had my doubts.  I had already discovered that I loved it for cooking.  It was perfect for stir-fries, giving just a little hint of coconut.  I used it for my homemade granola and for roasting fruit, yum!  But after reading that it made a good moisturizer, I carried my jar up to the bathroom.  The first time I tried it as a moisturizer after a shower.  It was a little hard to get out of the jar, but my skin warmed it up nicely.  It penetrated easily, leaving a subtle coconut aroma.  I even used it on my face, one side coconut oil, the other side my regular moisturizer.  The next morning the coconut oil side still felt soft and moist the other side dry!  I loved it so much, that I looked for ways to make applying it easier and found that it could be whipped.  I scooped out about 1/2 cup, whipped it into a lovely body butter with my stand mixer (added in a few drops of essential oil) and I had the perfect moisturizer!  I've read that you can melt it with cocoa butter, combine, let them come back to room temperature and whip them!  That is next on my list.  Love this!!",5
"I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  This review is for this product as skin care, rather then as food.  I haven't tried it for cooking.I used this as a moisturizer on my face and arms mostly.  I've made my own products at home in the past, mixing oils together.  I ran out of product and didn't want to order more so I decided I would try the coconut oil on it's own.  I prefer to keep my items clean and clear with natural ingredients only.  So it's a total win on that front.On my face I had some issues with it soaking in, which is common with oils, but if you add something it tends to help a lot.  I would put it on and then add just a tiny bit of aloe vera on top and it helps it soak in.  I also used emu oil (which isn't really an oil) and that worked as well.  Even just adding a bit of water and rubbing it on top seemed to help.  If you have chapped skin you don't really need to add any of that as it will soak in, but it will protect it for a little extra longer.  I found that at night I felt a bit greasy, but during the day it was fine.  So I'm not sure why that is (maybe the sweating at night?).  I think that mixing this with some other things would probably just work better for me.  But I loved it for my sons skin, he gets blotchy, dry and itchy and this really worked well.  It took away the blotches and the itching.  It also worked under and around his nose when he had a cold and it got sore.One major bonus for me is that it doesn't have to be refrigerated.  When I've made my mixed oil skin care in the past it had to be refrigerated and it was a major pain since my bedroom is upstairs.  I like that I can keep this in my bathroom.  It is solid, so it's a bit of a pain to get out, but that keeps you from using too much most of the time.As a product this is a 5 star product for what it is.  As a skin care item I would give it 4 stars as I feel I need to experiment a bit to find the perfect balance on my own skin (at least my face), though it's perfect for my children.  For Coconut oil, it's great and I'm glad to finally have found one that's organic!",5
"Viva Coconut Oil is an excellent product and I recommend it highly for anyone who wants to increase their energy, cooking or skin care.  I used it primarily as a supplement on 2-3 times per day for about 60 days.  The Coconut Oil helped my digestive system and actually stopped several nasty digestive issues that I was having.  I also used it after my shower and it I also left my skin clearer and and moist.  I also felt my energy was increased and I actually have lost 3-5 pounds during the period that I was using the Coconut oil.  Really good stuff at a great price.",5
"amazing!!! I got this oil specially for my acne prom face, because I heard that coconut oil is really good healing acne scar.when I was reading the reviews here on amazon about how some people put this all over the body I thought OMG!!! it is crazy, cuz I thought it was going to be greasy, shiny and slippery, but I WAS WRONG, this oil is amazing!!! perfect for the winter and dry skin, this oil really give your skin the perfect moist with out living it greasy or slippery or oily looking, this oil doesn't even have the the strong coconut oil smell either, it is fine to put it all over the body, am in love with it.",5
"First, I have to say I love anything coconut and am easily turned off by a not-so-coconut fragrance!When I opened the lid of the Viva Labs Coconut Oil I was instantly pleased with the 'true' aroma of pure coconut.  Since it arrived in quite warm weather it had liquified and I was 'almost' tempted to put a straw in it and drink it and/or mix up a bunch of wonderful drinks :)I separated the contents of the jar into two other air-tight containers so I could use one for cooking and one for cosmetic use.In the two months I have had the coconut oil I have used it for cooking with excellent results, on toast, as a moisturizer on my face and body and slathered it on my dry feet.  It morphs into the skin quickly with no greasy after feel and the fragrance lingers and lingers.I even put a small amount on candles, both real and flameless....sometimes I just open one of the jars to smell the fragrance :) I was sent a sample of the Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for an honest review and this is honest - I will be buying more in the future, I love it that much!Excellent, excellent product!",5
"I've been a coconut oil user for a couple years now after reading about how all other oils break down in to unhealthy oils (transfats, hydrogenated, etc) and the health problems associated with them. I prefer organic and non-GMO because I don't want a healthy oil that is saturated in pesticides or one that is genetically altered with very little research to justify calling it a safe process. This is stuff we are putting inside us and it should be safe.This was my first time trying Vita Labs' product and I was challenged by the manufacturer to use it on my skin as well as to cook with. I admit the idea of using something we cook with on my skin was an odd idea. Then I did some research and found the crap that is in other products we normally put on our skin. So I gave this a try.I've been using it on my skin now for most of a month and have been incredibly satisfied with it. It is oily a bit, but only at first, and holds the moisture in all day long. Normally, I'd use moisturizing oils and lotions several times a day as they are absorbed and then no longer effective. One time a day and this was great. (Worked great after shaving as well.) I have been holding off on my review for a bit now waiting for the cold and dry season to start. Now that it's here I can say this holds up at least as well as leading moisturizers. I've used it in the cold of Tennessee and Ohio and in both places I've had well moisturized skin (and lips). There is no byproduct on the skin and no smell.I'm very impressed by this company and its product. It cooks great, is great for skin, and is organic and non-GMO. The price is right in line with other more familiar brands. I recommend you give them a shot. I'm glad I did.A sample of this product was provided by the manufacturer as a review sample.",5
"After I got this, I placed it besides my stove and forgot about it for a couple months. Tonight, I cooked with it for the first time. OH MY GAWD!!! SO GOOD. I have been on a very strict slow carb diet the past few months and am very wary of anything that is too oily entering my system. My bride is not dieting at all, but she shares the same desire for crisp, fresh food. So, I was quite delighted tonight when I was able to brown pork chops with this and they were not AT ALL oily afterwards. This clean coconut oil left ZERO residue on the food or on my cookware. Instead, my house was filled with the most amazing coco-candy-like aroma. When the neighbor kid can by to return some errant mail, he full on said ""WOW, this place smells good."" The best part of course was that the food tasted amazing. I feel amazing. Wife happy. Husband successful. It apparently can be used for other things besides cooking (as this stuff is so pure), but that will have to wait for another day. THANK VIVA LABS!!!",5
"Man, this stuff is just great. When I first got it, I wasnt sure where it was going to get the most usein the bathroom or in the kitchen. Coconut oil is well known to be a tremendous beauty product, and I thought my wife would want to claim it as a moisturizer and to use on her hair. I was more interested in it as a cooking oil, for which coconut oil is equally famous.Ultimately, the kitchen won and this Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has become a permanent resident next to our stove. Its amazing. It works perfectly as a butter substitute, greases up a pan better than Crisco, and has become my wife and Is favorite handy cooking oil.  It has a nice, subtle scent and imparts just a hint of coconut taste that we both really love. We use this for Sunday morning omelets, for frying vegetables, for baking, for  popping popcorn , for  just about everything. Its sooo lovely to cook with. About the only thing I can compare it to is duck fat, which melts in about the same way and also adds a nice unctuous flavor and undertones.And yes, it also makes a great moisturizer and hair product. There is a reason why coconut oil is an ingredient in so many beauty products.  On its own, it is just as effective. And you get that nice, subtle coconut smell  mmmmmm, does it make my wife smell yummy!I got a sample of this from Viva Labs for review, but I will definitely be placing an order for some more. Its that good. And probably two tubs next time; one for the kitchen and one for the bathroom.",5
"The maker of this coconut oil offered me a free sample of this product. As we had never used coconut oil before, my wife and I were happy to run it through its paces. My wife covered the beauty side of it, I covered the kitchen side of it. Here's what we found.As a cooking oil, this is a great product. When the house is warm enough to keep this a liquid, it has much the consistency of olive oil, but as fall came, this was more often found in the container as a hard butter or lard-like texture. It was easy to spoon out, however, and made a really fragrant and effective cooking oil. I cooked various vegetable and meats with it, and found it added a delightful depth to lime and cilantro coated shrimp. I wouldn't use it to make eggs or something like that, but it can substitute easily and tastily in just about any dish where a fragrant flavored oil (sesame, olive, walnut, etc.) would be used. It really brought a new dimension to a lot of dishes.As for the beauty aspect, my wife tried this on her hands, body, face and hair. It provided smooth, nice-smelling, easily absorbed moisture just about anywhere she tried it. (I tried it on my hands and thought it was a little greasy, but I'm picky that way.) She also tried it as a sort of conditioner for her hair, but that experiment didn't work well. She ended up washing it out. Although it proved just as effective and easy to use as any of her other lotions, it may not be the most competitively priced option.Overall, this is a cooking and beauty oil with a lot of different uses and dimensions. Although we received this as a free sample, I can certainly see us purchasing more of this when we run out. With so much utility and flexibility, I give it a full five stars and recommend everyone keep a jar handy to use for whatever. It's a great product.Tacked on at the end: Made chicken and vegetable stir fry over rice with this tonight. It was delicious, as expected!",5
I have enjoyed using this from cooking to skin softener. It has a pleasant smell and I learned from other reviews ther was many more ideas to try. Great product. I love the fact it is organic too. 5 Stars !,5
"I had heard quite a bit about coconut oil before, but was worried that it would make my already oil prone hair even more oily.I avoided the top of my head and focused on my roots, and after waiting and showering, I was thrilled.  The oil made my hair soft and smooth without the grease I was expecting.Absolutely try this out, it is really fantastic!",5
"Like many people, I've been convinced of the many benefits of using coconut oil for cooking, and over the years have tried many different brands. My default oil to use, however, is still olive oil, and this, in part, is because I hadn't yet found a coconut oil that I really liked. The various brands I had tried were too greasy, too expensive, or the odor/taste was too strong and changed the flavor or my foods. However, thanks to the fine folks at Viva Labs, who offered me a sample in exchange for the possibility of writing a review, I have found my preferred coconut oil and my search is over! What I like about Viva Labs coconut oil is that it seems so clean and crisp--yes, sounds silly and scripted, but I don't know how else to describe it; I suppose the word I'm looking for is ""pure."" And as I said earlier, I especially appreciate that it doesn't change the flavor of my foods, which is what put me off before--I really don't want my dover sole (for example) to taste like coconut. As someone who makes homemade face creams, I look forward to using it in my next batch, as well as trying it as a hair conditioner. I prefer to keeping my cooking, personal care, and home maintenance simple by having a few key ingredients that serve multiple purposes--and Viva Labs coconut oil is another staple and quality product that does just that!",5
"Viva Labs' coconut oil was my first venture into cooking with coconut oil.  It comes cold-pressed and has the consistency of hardened shortening. But, that is where the loose resemblance to shortening ends.  Viva Labs' coconut oil smells great, tastes great, and adds a hint of coconut/sweetness to whatever I cook.  I have also eaten teaspoons right out of the container & the coconut oil has a pure coconut flavor - a light flavor that is quite pleasing.Overall, the coconut oil does not leave my food greasy & the added, subtle flavor addition really enhances some of the meals that I cook - I've used this coconut oil with chicken, popcorn & oatmeal cookies.  Everything was quite tasty.I am almost finished with my container & coconut oil will stay on my shopping list now that I've discovered bow much I like it.**Disclaimer**Viva Labs sent me their product for review purposes. The review is my own opinion & Viva Labs did not request/require a positive review.",5
"I'm just an average ""joe"", Im not an amazon vine voice or a top reviewer, however, I did get this coconut oil more out of curiosity than anything else. I am almost completely through my first bottle. I have used this coconut oil primarily for cooking purposes. I havent really used it on my skin as a lotion or anything.First thing you need to know is that this is solid at room temperature and is supposed to be. It will start turning liquid around 80-90. It will start to smoke at around 345. You need to keep your cooking/baking temps under 350 if you want to use this without creating carcinogenic smoke. I have enjoyed cooking up some vegetables (corn, asparagus, green beans etc.) with this coconut oil as a substitute for butter. I have also wrapped up the veges with aluminum foil a dash a sugar with the coconut oil and steamed them on the grill. Those came out great.For health purposes I still prefer Extra Virgin Olive Oil over coconut oil. But like EVOO, EVCO (extra virgin coconut oil) has a very strong flavor. That being said do not use this for anything you are looking for neutral flavors for. This will impart coconut flavoring to anything thats cooked with this. But in baking cakes a little coconut flavor would be great where olive oil may not be so great. So you used your best judgement.Overall its a good oil, and if I decide to buy coconut oil again I would consider this one.",4
"I was extremely happy with Viva Labs Coconut Oil. I've been a faithful user of coconut oil for years now and I use it for many different things:- I add a little into my tea for both the flavor and the health benefits- I use it in cooking and baking- I use it as a deep conditioner for my hair- I use it as a skin moisturizer all over my face every night (it's supposed to help keep wrinkles away!)- It works great to help heal minor scrapes- It is fabulous for really dry skin. My husband gets severely dry and cracked knuckles from working outside so much and by putting the coconut oil on the cracked skin, it helps heal it really fast- We use it as a diaper cream for our infant (it's completely safe for cloth diapers as well)- I give my dogs a little with their meals for the added health benefit- We use it as massage oil- I also use it on my dogs skin if they have dry skin- We have a hairless guinea pig who occasionally gets dry patches on his skin. We now regularly use a little coconut oil on his skin and it is looking better than ever.There are so many uses for this awesome stuff!I have tried many different brands of coconut oil over the years and in the last couple years I've gone strictly to organic varieties. I noticed that with the Viva Labs coconut oil, it is much smoother in texture than the others I've used (which have had almost a bit of a grainy texture). The Viva Labs one is like butter - it's so smooth and feels wonderful when I rub it onto my face every night. I never get that greasy feeling with it either. It blends into my skin quite fast which I like. It tastes great too (I actually like the taste of coconut oil) so I love to add it to tea, stir fries, muffins and onto toast in place of butter.I highly recommend this coconut oil and I will be sticking with this brand in the future now :)Disclaimer: I was given one of these coconut oils to try but all opinions are my own.",5
"Since I have begun using coconut oil as a moisturizer, I can see a difference in the texture of my skin. I transfer some into a small sterile jar and keep it with my toiletries. Why use expensive creams when I can use something natural that gives my skin a more youthful appearance and a glow? Another great use for this coconut oil is as a butter replacement on toast. My Nutiva spreads and melts like one of those margarines that take a long time to melt; the Viva Labs spreads like softened butter and melts like a dream. Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today, and my first experience with the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil was very positive.",5
"Organic extra virgin coconut oil is recommended for its health benefits, and the Viva Labs brand is probably the most flavorful I have ever tasted. The coconut flavor on its own is delectable, but it also blends in nicely with other foods -- it gives dishes almost a sweetness. The price is reasonable, too! I would highly recommend this coconut oil.",5
"I've been hearing a lot about coconut oil lately.  Within the last couple of months, I have two different friends rave to me about coconut oil.  The first talked to me about the scientific studies that suggest that regular consumption of coconut oil is effective at preventing cognitive deficits (e.g. dementia resulting from Alzheimers, Parkinsons, etc.), which is of interest to me for both personal and professional reasons.  The second friend raves about all of the healthy benefits of cooking with coconut oil.  So I had already been contemplating a purchase of coconut oil when I was offered a free sample from Viva Labs in exchange for an honest review.  I have not been disappointed.If you don't know much about coconut oil, you may be surprised to know it is really more of a solid at room temperatures similar to a consistency of margarine or Crisco.  It has a lovely flavor for cooking . . . essentially flavorless with a very subtle, pleasant coconut essence.It is effective as a skin moisturizer.  We are heading into the cooler months and this product has been helpful for keeping my skin smooth and moisturized.I haven't tried it as a hair conditioner yet, but I have heard it woks well for that as well.Overall, I recommend this coconut oil.  It has countless uses for a healthy lifestyle!",5
"I like the simple packaging, and of-course the ingredients are simple too. It is coconut oil. As far as I can tell all the leading brands of coconut oil are organic and pure. It has a light fragrance. This product is very versatile and can be used as a supplement, moisturize hair and body and you can cook with it too!  Wow, right? I  just used it as a moisturizer. I did not want to ingest the same product, I used it to moisturize my feet which is what I found it moisturizes best. I found it was too greasy to use on my hands or arms; on my hair it was very hard to work in and rinse out. The product lasts a long time since a little bit goes a long ways. The value is competitive with similar products.",4
"I'm already a big fan of coconut oil- I have been using unrefined and refined versions of coconut oil for years. When Viva Labs offered me a free jar in exchange for an honest review- I thought why not? I may just discover a new ""go-to"" brand for my coconut oil. Well it worked. Viva Labs produces a top shelf product. The oil is certified organic- so no pesticide residue in the oil- just pure, unrefined extra virgin oil to work with.For cooking, I love the thrill of adding it to some sautes- it adds a coconutty flavor, so it is welcome in any sweet potato or squash dish. As a treat, we make ""movie popcorn"" using the oil for popping. It's great with just a bit of sea salt. Pancakes are extra tasty using coconut oil, as are many baking recipes- just subsitute out for butter or other oils.For beauty, coconut oil has many uses. It's great for your skin, and your hair. I make a home-made skin lotion mixing coconut oil with olive oil and apply it at night. My skin feels supple and soft. It's great for the hair. My curly tresses feel tamed with a weekly application of coconut oil. Just be sure you are ok with smelling like a coconut.I can recommend this product- it is quality- and quite affordable. In fact it's half the price of my usual brand. Thumbs up.",5
"This is absolutely the best coconut oil I've ever used. And so diverse: I use it to cook with, on my skin and hair, and as a nutritional supplement. I even rub it into and around my fingernails. It takes a little digging to get it out of the container for cooking or simply put the container in warm water to heat up the oil. So glad to read it promotes thyroid health - an issue for me. Feels good on the skin and is light, not greasy, with that great aroma. I highly recommend this product.",5
"I had been reading so much about the health benefits of coconut oil that I started replacing it in my cooking, instead of using vegetable or olive oil.  I don't find that the coconut taste is so strong that it is overpowering in anything I cook and even have fried eggs in it successfully.Speaking of eggs, I also have added Viva Labs Coconut Oil to my chickens' diet. The health benefit carry over into animals as well as humans and it's a wonderful base for the various treats I make for them instead of using bacon grease or suet.I will be a repeat customer.LisaFresh Eggs Dailywww.fresh-eggs-daily.com",5
This coconut oil is slightly tastier than most othersI have tried. It's pleasantly flavorful and not in anyway overpowering.,5
"Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is an amazing product. We use coconut oil for a variety of things in our house, and Viva Labs Coconut Oil is our choice. I love that it is GMO FREE and Certified Organic!We use Viva Labs coconut oil in the kitchen for cooking. Did you know that coconut oil helps in digestion, and can help you with your diet by controlling cravings? Yes! Some people have even said they lose weight when using Organic Coconut Oil. It has to do with thermogenesis. Just 2-3 tablespoons a day will help keep your digestive system running smoothly and help get rid of problems like indigestion, plus they help your body absorb vitamins and minerals better, to make you healthy! My husband used to have a problem with indigestion, until he started taking a tablespoon of coconut oil with every meal!We wrestle with eczema and psoriasis in our home, and Viva Labs Coconut Oil helps with that too! You can use it straight out of the tub to rub on the affected area or mix it with your hand lotions! We have a tub of Viva Labs in our bathroom to use for eczema/psoriasis, dry elbows, hair conditioner, etc. After a little while the coconut aroma usually disappears, but if you don't like the smell you can mix it with your other products.Viva Labs Coconut Oil is cold pressed which makes it better for nutritional uses. It's so white when you open the lid! The aroma is amazing, and Viva Labs is our choice for Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.",5
One of my greatest purchases on amazon this product is so good for my hair and it smells delicious! Im thinking of trying to to usd it to cook,5
I just received mine and i love the smell. I bought it for my hair. i will be using it for few months and then update the review.,3
"This is the first time I've used this brand.  It appears to be the same as other brands I've tried (Trader Joe's and Harvest something?), and they all seemed about the same to me - I never had two side-by-side to do a taste or cooking test, but using them one after the other, I was unable to distinguish between them.I know the Trader Joe's brand was half the price of the first brand we tried, but I don't remember how their price compares to Viva Labs.My mother-in-law, who happened to be here when we opened the Viva Labs jar, said it was far more coconut flavored than the brands she has tried.  For some things, I'd count that as a positive, but most recently, we made home-made Magic Shell, and the coconut flavor was a bit too strong for putting on flavored ice creams.But, in short, next time I go to buy a jar, I'll check this brand out and see how it compares price-wise with what I get locally.Note: I was given this jar by the manufacturer in exchange for a review (whether positive or negative).",4
"This was my first experience with coconut oil as a product (i.e., not as an ingredient in something else), and I'd say I got off to a good start with this particular item. I received a free sample for review purposes, and I really wasn't sure where to begin. While waiting for it to arrive, I did a little looking online (beyond the product description and reviews here) to see how people use coconut oil like this. I was admittedly skeptical about using a skin care product as a food item and vice versa, but it's legitimate, and I suppose there are other natural products that have a wide range of uses. Anyway, this coconut oil definitely has a nice coconut aroma. My wife insisted that I try tasting it; she liked eating it plain, but I was not enthused about the texture -- nothing wrong with it, but akin to eating butter straight and I wouldn't do that either (and she would, so it's a personal preference thing).We both tried out using it on our skin, and one of our sons did as well. Once again, my wife appreciated its use for that more than I did, as I felt it took too long for my hands to not feel oily, and my son agreed (although he tried it more times than I did, so he didn't give up on it as easily). It seems like a little bit will go a long way for this use. I might try it again, but with as many dry-skin issues as we have here, we have a lot of lotions to choose from, and most of them are more convenient for dispensing. If I only wanted to use this for moisturizing I wouldn't be hesitant to scoop it out with my fingers, but since we intend to use it for food too we basically have to use a spoon. Just not as convenient as others, although I could see loading up a refillable tube to make dispensing easier.I noticed that some reviewers commented on the product being liquid. That was not the case here, but our house tends to be on the cool side, so it probably depends on your average room temperature.The first thing we did food-wise, other than eating it plain, was to make ""movie theater popcorn."" It was definitely good for that. I also plan to experiment with it in baking, but have not had time for that yet. With the holidays on the way, though, I'm sure I'll have a chance.I have no complaints about this product, although I don't see myself using it for all of the various purposes that people find for coconut oil in general. When this sample runs out, I would not be surprised at all if my wife wanted to order more, and I would not be opposed to that.",4
"This product is truly multipurpose.  First, as soon as you open the jar you will notice it smells wonderful, like pure coconut!  Second, as a moisturizer it absorbs quickly and softens dry skin.  And third, it tastes wonderful if you are interested in a supplement or using it for cooking.  I would recommend this product and would purchase a 2nd jar.",5
"I love it because every application that I have used it for, it has been superb. I find it very tasty for sauteing vegetables. I took some and softened it in my hand to use as a skin conditioner and that worked great. I have always poured a little coconut oil on my animals' food for the same benefits that people expect. I recently had a  large breed puppy that spent five days overnight at the vet with a gastric inflammation and was on IV fluid and every attempt to return to regular food had the result of vomiting that had brought her to the vet in the first place.She was better but with  several medications, the vet sent her home with the warning that she might need help with maintaining her nutritional balance. She threw up her regular dog food and I thought"" She needs a soothing food on that inflamed intestine"".So I mixed up the Viva coconut oil with a powdered  ""people"" meal replacement. Bingo. That did it. She never threw up after getting her coconut oil based meals. Now she is back on dog food with a little coconut oil on top. She is thriving and two weeks ago she was near death.",5
"I just used up the last of my jar of Viva Labs coconut oil and loved it! I used it for cooking all my meats and vegetables, I used it in an almond flour pie crust, and made some delicious chocolate by melting the coconut oil, adding unsweetened cocoa powder, powdered stevia and a touch of cinnamon, SO good! I liked the coconut oil because it's NonGMO and had a very subtle coconut flavor and from what I've read most high quality coconut oils should have a mild coconut flavor. Now that I'm done with all the coconut oil, I've been saving the tub and getting the tiny bit that's left behind and using it as a moisturizer! So many uses for this stuff! I'm hooked!",5
"I tried this product as a free sample. When I first opened the jar and smelled the true coconut I was impressed. I started using it right away. Growing up I always heard coconut oil was very good for the skin. I use it right after taking a bath or hot shower before going to bed. When I wake up my skin feels so smooth. I started using it on my two grandchildren and noticed they do not have the dry lips that they usually get with the change of weather. Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a very good product, I recommend it everyone.It is also good for the hair just before a touch-up.",5
"I had been using coconut oil for years while doing wilderness hiking to combat the dry skin the mountain air gives me when my better half turned me on to all the other uses of the oil about six years ago. Not just cooking but the antibacterial and other medicinal properties of the oil make it truly one of the wonderfoods brought to us by our very generous Mother. So since then we've tried almost every brand out there, and we've found most of them are in fact very good, as long as they're cold pressed and organic virgin. Viva fits in to those categories.The only difference I can feel and taste (we eat it on toast a lot, and use it for stir fries on occasion, though I prefer hemp oil for that now) is that the Viva stuff has a slightly more pronounced coconut flavor. I like this, as I love the smell and taste of coconut, so it's a plus for me. For those who want a coconut oil that imparts less coconut flavor to their dishes etc, I'd go for the Nutiva, our normal go-to brand (especially as they sell big tubs of it very cheaply in some stores and online). But if you like the coconut taste, this stuff gives as much of it as most any brand I can think of.And if you're just using it for the skin and other external uses, then this is a fine choice, and the price of 9 and change here for a pound is well in line with most every other good organic brand. Viva sent me this sample and I've been using it for toast due to the strong coconut taste. If they start selling one and five gallon tubs at a good discount, this might even become our daily brand.",5
"Disclosure: I was contacted by Viva Labs about reviewing this product and was generously provided with a free review sample.I will admit I wasn't familiar with coconut oil as the latest wonder product - and would have been skeptical if I had been, as I generally don't give a lot of credence to the ""latest and greatest"" buzz products.  I was more than pleasantly surprised at how versatile coconut oil was though!  I didn't use it to cook - I don't do a lot of cooking with oil, even ""healthy"" oils.  I did, however, use it for a surprising variety of health/beauty purposes (I googled coconut oil for ideas beyond the obvious moisturizing), and absolutely loved it.  I used it to smooth fly-away hairs, give my hair a little extra shine and hold, as a hand and foot moisturizer, and as a facial moisturizer.  It smells amazing, of course, and brought a little bit of summer to my skin/hair.  It goes on greasy of course - it is, after all, oil.  But it absorbs into your skin within a minute at most and leaves you feeling completely non-greasy yet moisturized for hours - a huge bonus because I have a baby and am constantly washing my hands.  (On that note, I love that it's organic and natural, so doesn't add anything chemical to my hair/skin.)  The quick absorption makes it an excellent over-makeup facial moisturizer - excellent for a quick touch-up if makeup gives you dry skin flakes (I'm a red head with sensitive skin that tends to dry in fall/winter, so this is a big issue for me).  The only other moisturizing product I've ever found that worked over makeup this well is made by Chanel - and extremely pricey.  This is a wonderful, inexpensive answer to a number of moisturizing issues - I will definitely make it a part of my regular health/beauty routine.",5
"I've been using coconut oil for so many things recently. I cook with it and as well as use it for skin care. It is a solid at cooler temperatures, but begins to melt as soon as it touches my skin. It feels a little thick as a ""lotion"" at first, but it does absorb quickly and doesn't leave behind a greasy residue. I've been using it as a night cream on my face for several weeks, and my skin feels softer, smoother, and younger. Organic coconut oil actually smells like coconut which is a fragrance I enjoy.Thank you to Viva Labs for sending me a bottle to review.",5
"'Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil' has many uses, and many advantages for either cooking purpose, or as a beauty product. In comparison to many other products on the market advertised for coconut oil, this product is one of the best I've used in 20 years. I love coconut for cooking, and for beauty skin-care. The fragrance of this oil is divine, and serves the purpose for cooking recipes,  as a skin-care product, or for hair-care.My daughter and I have very dry skin, and have used this product for a duration of 4 weeks, with great results for skin-care. It has many uses, but we used it for the bath, and applied small amounts to dry skin on elbows, legs and knees. In addition, I use it once a day on my hands, after cleaning, and washing dishes. Our skin feels smooth, like silk, and we have no skin irritations.We are content after using this oil, after 4 weeks, and continue to use it daily. It is great for cooking, baking, skin, and hair care. When I find a product that is extremely useful, especially in several ways, we stick with it. We plan to always have this oil in the house, available for its many uses. Highly recommended!Special Note: I received a complimentary full size bottle of this product from the PR Coordinator of Viva Labs, in exchange for an honest review.",5
"This coconut oil is very firm at room temperature, but melts easily for cooking and rubs into the skin when used as a moisturizer.I tried it for frying pancakes and was very happy with the results. Also tried it on my skin and it felt great. It has a pleasant coconut smell and almost no taste when I tried a little from the jar. When used for cooking it has a very mild, almost no taste.This is a quality product in comparison to some cheap, non-organic stuff I bought at a big box store. The fact that it has a coconut smell tells me it's pure.I didn't try it as a supplement. I will try blending it into a smoothie sometime, but I can't just take a spoonful. I buy coconut oil capsules so I don't have to taste it.I would definitely buy this product again. I received my first jar free for review purposes from Viva Labs. I was not obligated to write a positive review.",5
"I was sent this Coconut oil for review, and it smells very light and clean. You can use it as a lotion, (it did wonders for my dry elbows) you can use it to cook with, and it's more healthy than the vegetable oil I usually use, and you can even use it in your hair and it doesn't get all gunky. I really like this coconut oil, and was glad that I was chosen to review it. Having never used Coconut Oil before, I didn't know what I was missing!",5
"I was extremely surprised by quality of this coconut oil, this is amazing stuff!  This oil has a fantastic aroma that smells like tropical coconuts.  It also has a very nice, smooth taste.  You'll want to grab a spoon and try some right out of the container after you open it.It's not hard to tell that this oil has undergone a very minimal amount of processing, it's simply pure natural coconut oil.As a vegan I eat quite a bit of coconut oil in my diet and I've tried quite a few different brands over the years but this is the best I've had.  It's also a Non-GMO verified product which was  very nice to see on the label.This is great oil for popping popcorn, adding to smoothies, or making chocolate.",5
"I received a sample for an honest review, and promptly gave it to my significant other to try it out. :) She enjoyed it as a skin moisturizer. It comes in a cold-pressed tub but quickly turns to liquid as it contacts your skin. A little greasy at first, but quickly absorbs into the skin. Great smell if you love coconut; I do. We haven't yet tried it as a cooking aid, though it actually tastes good!",5
"It arrived as expected!!! Great nutty smell!!I use it for my face, body, and hair!! leaves it moisturized and smells yummy!Im looking into recipes for it and i'm sure it will come in handy!!",5
"I just have to say ""WOW""! This coconut oil is the best I've ever tried. As soon as I opened the cap, a burst of coconut aroma spread to my nose; it was heavenly. I use this oil for my hair and skin. I have a thick, coarse 4a type of hair and this oil soaks into my hair so nicely giving it a healthy shine. It's not greasy or oily either! I also love using this oil in my skin care routine. Turmeric powder, milk, lemon, and this coconut oil can heal just about any blemishes. Compared to other brands I've tried like Coco Care (that I bought on amazon) this brand is tops! Nice size and safe shipping also, I'd definitely recommend!",5
"I'm not much of a cook so I can't comment Viva Labs' Coconut oil in that light, but I have been using it on my skin.  It is a great product for moisturizing and soothing dry skin.  In addition to its skin care applications, it smells great.  If you're looking for a great coconut oil to use on dry skin (I use it regularly on my feet), check out this great product from Viva Labs.  You will not be disappointed.",4
I'm going to be completely honest and let you all know that I'm using this coconut oil for health and beauty reasons. I'm an African American woman with natural hair. I have been having a difficult time finding an oil that would work well with my hair to lock in moisture after creating various styles on my natural hair. Most oils like olive oil or raw shea butter etc. were too heavy for me and left some what of a build up on my hair. I have 4B natural hair. The Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has done wonders for my hair and skin! It locks in moisture for my hair and moisturizes my skin. I also suffer from extremely dry skin and this works well for that. It even works better than the Palmer's Coconut Butter that I normally use. I don't use this oil for cooking so I can't speak on that but I love using it in my hair and on my skin. It has a light airy scent which is good. I highly recommend it for black women with natural hair. It will definitely lock in moisture. My hair hasn't been dry and I've also noticed that it mends split ends! It has been added to my hair care regiment.,5
"I was HUGE skeptic of using coconut oil for anything but a vacation tan, Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is wonderful for cooking as well as for the hair and skin. When I first opened the jar, the scent was light as flowers and the consistency of the oil is also very light.I used Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in my baking and I love it! I even used it to fry for a dinner and it tasted great. I then used the coconut oil on my skin now that the seasons has changed, I have some dry skin and this oil is very light, absorbs easily and I don't have any breakouts from using it as I did with another brand that claimed to be organic.Thanks to Viva Labs providing me with a free sample, I am no longer a skeptic, I am now a devoted customer! It is amazing all the uses for coconut oil and Viva Labs is really the best. Thank you!",5
"This is an excellent non-GMO, extra-virgin organic coconut oil.*** For those who have never used coconut oil: ***The scent is fabulous! Like every coconut oil I've used, this product is a harder texture and so you kind of have to dig it out. But it works excellent for both cooking and skin uses. My favorite cooking use is to use coconut oil to pop popcorn. The taste is phenomenal and makes me never want to eat popcorn popped any other way.  I have also used it as a normal oil for sauteing onions, etc., but my favorite use (by far) is for popcorn. This coconut oil is a great skin moisturizer as well. Actually, about a week after I received the oil, I noticed a painful crack on my heel. I'd never experienced this, so I googled what to do. Sure enough, there were recommendations to put coconut oil in the area to moisturize the skin. I used a gauze pad and applied the oil along with some neosporin before wrapping it up. It definitely moisturized the previously dry skin and helped the area to heal. There are so many uses for coconut oil, but these are some of the ways I have used it this week.I received this product from Viva Labs so that I might share a review.This is my honest review, and I would definitely share openly if I thought this was a substandard product. I think the product is excellent. The quality and scent of the oil are excellent, and I would be happy to buy and use this oil again. Enjoy!",5
"I love using coconut oil for cooking (popping popcorn, sneaking into baked goods in place of butter or even for frying pancakes etc..)Coconut oil is also my go to oil for homemade beauty products. It is perfect for those with sensitive skin, and chronic itchy skin in winter. A while back I started making my own bee balm using a mix of bee wax and coconut oil instead of using the storebought stuff laden with all sorts of chemicals and other things that I don't want in my body. Every winter I've always had skin that was so itchy and dry and felt terrible, but since using my own homemade balm my skin is SO much better in winter. The oil is also great applied sparingly on its own to your feet right after showing or even just using a teeny teeny tiny bit rubbed between the palms and applied very, very sparingly to tame the frizzies on curly hair.The coconut oil itself is great since it is organic, extra virgin, unrefined, unbleached and cold pressed. I received my order on a hot day and the coconut oil was pretty hot inside the plastic packaging after sitting on my doorstep and it made me a bit nervous about plastic chemicals leaching into the product. It would be nice if it were available packaged in glass.Note: I received a free container of coconut oil to review, but all opinions stated are mine :)",4
"This product was offered to me for use, and although I am not into using Coconut Oil as a food product, I do use it mainly on my skin.I love the smell of coconut!  But, I have not used in on my skin.  I have been placing it on he heels of my feet, and actually covering the entire feet.  It's getting cooler, so the air is dry and I have been covering up the feet and legs more, thus not paying special attention to the rough spots on the extremities.I have placed this quite a bit, every day that I can remember, and the improvement is remarkable. Placing it on the skin and neck is great.  I love the way the oil stays on the skin for hours and hours, leaving that moist feel.No, cooking with coconut oil is not my option, don't have a need to.  But, using this on my skin is great.  When you grab a few fingers full, spread it on the skin, and instantly it becomes the oil.Next, I plan to sleep with coconut oil in my hair.As I said...  boy,  do I smell delicious!  This product was received in order to complete a review.  Rizzo",5
"Coconut oil has been a staple in our home for two years now and I've tried every one that's available for sale. We had our favorite, but have recently switched to this as our favorite. It has a much silkier texture than any other CO's we've tried. Rather than a crystallized glob eventually, it remains ""silky"" no matter what temperature it's stored at.I use this for cooking, smoothies, and for skin and hair care. For skin care it melts quickly and absorbs perfectly without greasy residue. In smoothies it gives a hint of coconut taste but not overbearing and that is the same for cooking as well. I am unable to ingest it straight up, as is highly recommended by health gurus, but that is because of my own inability to handle the oily texture and not because of the product itself.The certifications give me great confidence health-wise when I am using this. It is not only certified organic it is also certified NON-GMO, which is just as vital for our family. Also, the fact that it is cold-pressed, makes it so that we are getting the original goodness of the oil and the coconut's nutrients, rather than a by-product that resulted from high temperatures. And while it comes in a plastic jar, which is something we try to use minimally in our household, I am appreciative that it is a BPA free plastic jar, as stated on the back.",5
"I love Coconut Oil- It has so many uses- I cook with this in place of oil in many recipes especially frying and cooking foods on stove- Used for greasing baking pans and sheets. I add a little in my hair the night before washing, and have used a little bit to make my hair shiny ( have to be really careful and make sure small amounts melted on warm hands first ). My hair is super shiny!Lastly I use on my two small dogs- A Chug and Yorkie Mix. Their coats are brighter, skin feels softer and I feed about 1/2 of teaspoon daily- They lick it up like its a steak, they love their coconut oil. I have been purchasing the Viva brand, and have no complaints.I am anxious to try other uses, but for now for what I have been using for two months 5 stars for sure on the company and product!",5
"A few weeks ago I was contacted by Viva Labs with an offer of a free 15 oz jar of Coconut Oil for my review.  Of course I said yes and I'm glad I did.I had NO idea what coconut oil was used for.  As you can tell from the many other reviewers, there isn't much that it can't be used for.  I have not ingested it into my body but I do use it on my body, particularly my legs and feet, my hands and my nails.  I have no need to use it on my hair and I am hesitant to cook with it.  I already use Canola Oil when I use oil at all for cooking.Be careful when opening!!! When I gleefully opened my box and jar of Coconut Oil, I got a lap full of liquid oil.  I jumped up and tried to wash it off the jar, can't be done.  I immediately put it on folded paper towels in the refrigerator where it solidified.  Whew!  Now after reading the directions it states that jar should be stored in a cool, dry place.  It did not tell me that UPS would deliver it hot.  Well, I guess it is a might warm here in Georgia in August and September. I've kept it out in the house as I keep it under 76 degrees inside and it is solid and easy to use just rubbing my fingers across the top.The biggest thumbs up for me is the pleasant smell.  It DOES NOT smell like coconut oil which I was afraid of.",5
"This is a tasty coconut oil. The consistency is a creamy yet firm state (sometimes coconut oil will get a little grainy in transit and maintain a hard consistency). I tried it with a variety of products and it worked well with meat, veggies, and as a butter substitute. My favorite is with fish as I like the mild coconut aroma and the fish fries up nice and crunchy (better than with butter for some reason).If you are trying to eat healthier and want an alternative to other oils I recommend this coconut oil for its pure taste and butter-like consistency. If you've never tried coconut oil as a replacement for butter I highly recommend it. It doesn't leave a greasy taste to your lips or hands (if you use it on a food like popcorn). It is also easier to clean than butter.",5
"My sisters and I use coconut oil on a daily basis.  Typically we use Carrington Farms and Nutiva though I have tried Spectrum and Tropical Traditions also. Of the 4 mentioned, Spectrum was the least of my choices.I recently received a 15 oz container of Viva Labs Coconut Oil and wanted to share my thoughts on it compared to the other oils we regularly use.I get together monthly with two of my sisters for a week of experimenting with and sharing healthy recipes.  So for this week, I brought the Viva Labs Coconut oil and asked the other two sisters to use it exclusively.We used it to baste pumpkin and acorn squash before baking in the oven.  Two of the sisters used it for making popcorn. We used it for sauteing onions and peppers, mixing with cinnamon and honey (our honey-butter substitute), a carrot cake, and consuming it by itself.  I'm sure I've forgotten every single use but I even used it on my skin, too.Besides passing all the tests with flying colors, one sister even said in its more solid form, it seems to be less 'pithy' or as others would say, more smooth a texture than say, Nutiva.  In its liquid form, there's no noticeable difference in texture compared to the other coconut oils.  Taste for taste, its equal to what we are all accustomed to.I realize this is a new product line for Viva Labs, so if the price point is close to what we commonly purchase from Carrington Farms and Nutiva, I will have no problems in switching over to Viva Labs.Over all, I'd say it's a Home Run for Viva Labs!!!",5
"I have to admit that I was hesitant to use this product because of the name -- Vita Labs for FOOD? -- and the label's claim of being ""great"" for both cooking and skin/hair care. I also wasn't sure of the wisdom of using a fat that congeals at room temperature.  When I did some research, I found even more, slightly horrifying, widespread uses for it.  Despite all this, I was soon using it as a moisturizer for my hands in the morning, removing black shoe marks from my hardwood floors in the afternoon, and cooking with it in the evening, all with an organic, sweet-smelling solid.  Of course, other natural oils such as olive and argan oils have multipurpose uses.  I just didn't expect coconut oil to be one of them or to be as versatile as it is.Despite the more chemical-sounding uses (as a hair conditioner and furniture polish), my primary use for this Viva Labs is cooking.  It melts quickly in a pan for sauting, and it leaves only a slight coconut taste that can disappear under stronger flavors.  I like it best with Thai sauts because that cuisine is often coconut-based anyway.  Although I haven't yet used it for baking, I expect to when I bake for vegans in the family at Christmas as a butter substitute instead of using shortening.  I just wish I didn't have to look at the word ""Labs"" when using a product for cooking.I often take a bit out of the pantry to soothe my hands after washing dishes or cleaning.  Some people use it for hair conditioning.  I'm not one of them.  Since my hair is not damaged, I prefer to save my jar for other uses.Many people advocate the use of coconut oil as a supplement for diabetes, Crohn's disease, and, ironically given the fat content, weight loss.  I couldn't find any hard evidence supporting the efficacy of these uses, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that it works for many. Because the label says that it may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts, anyone with an allergy to those things should steer clear.Obviously, if the smell of coconut turns your stomach, you won't like this because the scent leaves no doubt as to the oil's origin.  If, however, like me, you love coconut, you'll probably love this multipurpose, organic solid ""oil"" made without preservatives or other additives.  Note:  I received a sample for review.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5
".Review of Viva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  I was given a jar of Viva Coconut Oil  15 fl. oz.for a review.  I have never used any coconut oil so I did not know what to expect.I went on line to research the use of coconut oil.  The  uses are many, from a cosmetic use to a healthy food product.When the jar arrived, I decided to split the jar in half, one for the kitchen and another half jar  for the bathroom a cosmetic usage.When I opened the jar, I did not notice a strong fragrance, only a slight fragrance.a clean refreshing fragrance.  When on line one of the items listed is that coconut oil is nature's source of MCT, that increase metabolic rates in the body.MCT's promote what is called Thermogenesis , increases metabolic rates Increases Thyroid function. and controls blood sugar levels.I suffer from Lupus and decided to keep a journal of the usage of coconut oil.The progress of ... That evening I made a salad of lettuce from my greenhouse, hard boiled eggs, and lemon juice.  The coconut oil I placed under a warming light andit liquidized to a clear oil, I normally use Olive oil and found that the coconut oil light and favorable taste.  My hubby even commented on the lighter flavor.The next day, I spread coconut on my toast instead of butter, I sprinkled cinnamon, again I found the flavor light and tasty.The evening for dinner, I steamed butternut squash, lemon juice, thyme and rosemary sea salt and pepper, Great flavor!  A keeper so far.I found that coconut oil can replace butter in recipes.  Happy with the results in the kitchen.I am from Europe and Olive oil was what I grew up on, I still like to taste of olive oil but will replace for coconut oil to see if any results differ, Remember I take steroids for control of Lupus.  In the second week my weight was down by 6 lbs.So will continue to replace butter and Olive oil for Coconut oil.Now, on to the cosmetic results of coconut oil. I have always had extremely good luck with my complexion and shinny hair.  Never any blemishes, black hair that when was black as black, now I still have black mixed with a nice pure white.Again, I use olive oil to keep a softness and shine to my hair.I switched this past month to Coconut Oil, I thought my hair was soft and shinny, however, after one treatment, my hair was ultra shiny.  I was in line at our local Wal Mart and a lady behind me, taped me  on the shoulder to say how shiny my hair was.... ask how my hair was so shinny...honest! I was taken aback.  The white was a bright white and the black also a shiny color.I told her about the coconut oil, ...I also have never experienced any difficulty with hands chaffed or feet rough and caked.  My doctor writes a prescription for this cream,  Hydeocerin  cream for dry skin, but I added coconut oil to the Hydeocerin, I wear socks and gloves with the cream at nights ....  WOW! the very first night my hands and feet were super soft.I though, MY FACE!  as with Lupus, the sun is no friend and heat makes the fatigueunbearable.  If, I could take a bath in coconut oil, I would.  I replaced the hand lotion with coconut oil, and all through the day instead of hand lotion, I use just a pea size amount and have extremely soft hands ....and face.Who would have thought that one jar of coconut oil would give such results? I now  have several jars of Viva  organic extra virgin in the kitchen and both bathrooms.I highly recommend this product and look forward to health results as  the weeks pass by.As stated earlier I kept a Journal and will be taking the results to my doctor..bet she will be amazed too!A big Thank You to Viva Labs for selecting me to test their product.  I could not be happier.",5
"There are many uses for Coconut Oil ranging from a healthy butter alternative to using it as a skin moisturizer. Some people use it an energy supplement and some say its a great makeup remover. Ive even heard its great for people with MS (Multiple Sclerosis)!I was super excited when I received my package in the mail that I used it the next day as an all over body moisturizer. I spread it on as soon as I stepped out of the shower, while my skin was still damp. In the container, its stored as a solid, but as soon as you start smoothing it onto your skin, the warmth of your body temperature liquifies it. Ive received many compliments Ive started using it; people have noticed my extra-soft hands and silky smooth legs. I also love the fact that I smell like a walking, talking Almond Joy (yum!).I have yet to try it as an ingredient or a supplement, I realized I should have tried it before using it on my body. Now I feel like it would be unsanitary to use the oil for anything else. Perhaps Ill buy a separate container for the kitchen to test it out. I absolutely love the Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for my skin, and continue to use it in my bathing routine.I have not used it long enough to know if my skin will handle it. I have sensitive skin, so many moisterizers tend to make my face out. Ive been using if for over a week, and so far Im not sure. I had my monthly friend this week, so of course my face broke out. I will say, before my period it did not cause an explosion of pimples, so theres a plus.If you are looking for a great moisturizer, try Viva Labs Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. Dont be intimidated by the fact that its a cooking oil. Its solid until you start to use it. It does tend to take a little bit to rub in, but once you have it smoothed into your skin, its absorbed and does not leave behind a greasy residue.Read the full review on http://fashionistacatlady.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/viva-labs-organic-extra-virgin-coconut-oil/This product was given to me free in exchange for an honest review.

"I had the opportunity to try Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil.  I was sent a 15 oz container for free in exchange for my honest review.Viva Labs is a nutritional and supplements company that wants to help you get the optimal health benefits through their products.  Viva Labs stands behind their products 100% and are completely dedicated to your holistic health and personal well being.  Viva Labs sells a range of products both on their website and through Amazon and other sources.I am new to the coconut oil craze, but the more I read about it the more intrigued I become.  When I purchased my first ever batch of coconut oil, I began by putting a spoonful of coconut oil in my smoothies. Then I started using it as a replacement to vegetable oil in some of my cooking.  But, when I was contacted to try this product, I was asked about using it on my skin.  I hadn't thought much about that before and was happy with my current skin care products, but I gave it a shot.After washing my face in the evening, I grabbed a dime size amount of coconut oil and smoothed it on my face.  Keep in mind, our bodies are a nice warm 98.6 degrees, so once the oil hit my fingers, it melted.  It also doesn't absorb right away into your skin so your face is a bit ""greasy"" for awhile.  I wouldn't be able to use this in the morning before applying makeup.  But, at night, I did enjoy how it moisturized my skin.  I didn't notice any visible changes, but definitely noticed my skin was softer and I didn't have any acne issues during my trial period.  I also liked the light, tropical scent that coconut oil offers.While I was testing the coconut oil on my face, I ended up getting nasty burn on my hand from the oven.  It wasn't healing very well, so one night I decided to try putting coconut oil on the burn.  I think it made a huge difference in the healing and I ended up applying it frequently throughout the day to keep my skin around the burn moist.  My burn is almost unnoticeable now after less than two weeks.Coconut oil can be taken daily as a dietary supplement, can be added to your cooking, or can be used as a skin care or hair care product.  Coconut oil has been found to help fight bacteria and viruses as well as help those with thyroid issues.  It can also help diabetics maintain their blood sugar levels.  Coconut oil has been found to help lower your cholesterol, increase your metabolism, and aid in digestion.If you haven't tried adding Coconut oil to your daily diet and/or skin care routine, I highly recommend you give it a chance.  The health benefits are certainly worth you taking a look.",5
"I've used many different brands of coconut oil and this is one of the best.  Smooth, tasty, melts easily for cooking.  Great for skin care.  No funky odors.  Great value.  This one's a keeper!",5
"I have been trying Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in several recipes the last two weeks.  It has enhanced each one of them like no other coconut oil I have used in the past.  The flavor explosion that came through when used in a spicy shrimp and spaghetti dish was wonderful.  I used it to make a coconut and lemon rub for a baked chicken that seemed to come out with extra juice.  Even the gravy made from the drippings had a hint of coconut to compliment it.In addition, I used a small amount in an oil warmer.  It allowed the room to have a tropical smell for hours and made for a peaceful setting.  Aside from the Young Living essential oil line, this seemed to have the longest and most pungent aromatic quality to it.  As long as the price becomes reasonably close to other brands, Viva Labs has a winner on their hands!",5
"I LOVE that Viva Labs coconut oil is organic and non-GMO! I try to purchase as many non-gmo project products as possible. Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil participates and is verified as participating in the program.I use coconut oil as a cooking and baking ingredient, but my favorite use for it is as a beauty and health product for my family.My baby suffers from excessive dry skin on her armpits, behind her ears and in between her toes. Because these are naturally places where sweat produces, her body overreacts trying to dry her sweat. When I notice the red, chaffed skin, I rub a dab of the coconut oil to relieve the irritation several times a day. Within a day or two her skin is no longer irritated and I do not have to use a chemical filled baby lotion!I use the coconut oil as an end of day make-up remover and face wash. It does an absolutely amazing job of removing mascara! I no longer have to rub my eyes raw to remove my mascara at the end of the day. As an added bonus, coconut oil is a gentle facial cleanser that helps keep my skin clean, clear and beautiful.My husband likes using the coconut oil in his hair as a conditioner. After shampooing his hair, he applies a dab of coconut oil in his hair, massages into his scalp and rinses it out. He swears it has made his hair appear thicker and healthier. If my husband is commenting on how his hair looks and feels, the coconut oil must be doing something amazing!I also use the coconut oil on my son and daughter's palms. Both of their palms are callused and dry from baseball and gymnastics. I've found that the coconut oil helps soften the calluses. I'm hoping with time it will help eliminate the appearance of calluses on their hands.",5
"I was really kind of hesitant about this product...it seemed odd that I could use it to cook and eat AND on my hair and skin.  Sure, I've tried olive oil, vinegar, and mayonnaise before to condition my hair (god forbid you do the mayo...ick!), but it just seemed weird and I smelled like a salad after each.When I got it, my health nut son was thrilled, he'd been reading about the benefits of coconut oil for cooking and health, so he tried to take over on it.  We came to a draw and decided to share.  It failed NONE of our categories and exceeded expectations in everything.  Good stuff!Cooking:  Thai food (of course!), stir-frys, and baking all came out beautifully.  Banana bread with half coconut oil in place of butter was heavenly.  Didn't feel heavy or greasy on the finished recipe.Skin:  It's thick, a bit too thick for my arms but excellent moisture for feet and heels, and great on legs.  Left a lovely sheen on my legs too, so I'm wearing more shorts and dresses as summer ends.Hair: This was the best.  My son is a lifeguard and I swim regularly and color my hair.  My hair was like straw, seriously. Icky.  I did one deep condition with this, first heating it slightly and applying, then letting it sit for an hour.  Rinsed out with light shampoo and felt immediately better.  BUT, not perfect.  So two days later I did it again.  Softer afterwards.  After the third DEEP condition, I felt like I had new hair.  It had been so badly damaged that it was tangly and hard to style...now it's behaving. I realize with chlorine I will have to continue to use this on occasion, but it's not an issue...the price is right and a little goes a long way. My son didn't need to deep condition as his hair is a buzz-cut, but he liked the product too.Did I mention how good it smells?",5
"While I had heard of the many benefits of coconut oil, this seems to be one of those products where the more you use it, the more uses you find.For dry skin, it is very effective. Although the results are less immediate than Eucerin, it is far easier to use. Even when it has been exposed to the cold and solidifies, it melts almost instantaneously in your hand, and spreads easily. It smells wonderful. (Add aroma therapy to the list of benefits.) Unlike Eucerin, it washes off easily - another big plus.As a hair conditioner, it works well, but takes some getting used to, if you're not accustomed to oiling your hair and leaving it on for an extended period. Allow a couple of hours for the ""lube job,"" and don't lean back on anything upholstered. It does shampoo out really well, and the soft and manageable results are worth the effort.Since it is food grade, and recommended for cooking and baking, I thought I'd take it for a test drive. We've sworn off deep-frying, so I used it instead of PAM on a test batch of pancakes. The first batch, with PAM on the griddle, turned out light, fluffy, and edible. The coconut oil batch was all of that, and more. They cooked more evenly, were easier to turn, and were a beautiful shade of golden brown. I'd forgotten how nice cooking with oil could be.The smell while it heated was very pleasant. No surprises, there. What did come as a shock was how very little oil was required. I had added only a spoonful to the griddle, and had to use three paper towels to wipe off the excess when it melted. A little goes a VERY long way, especially in the kitchen.Another big surprise was the lack of any tendency to smoke. I turned up the heat a bit to see if it would have any effect, and it seemed to handle it well.The flavor is extremely mild, for all the delightfully powerful aroma. Taken as a dietary supplement, the taste is hardly noticeable, and since it melts so quickly, there is really no unpleasant sensation. (I had anticipated what amounted to a mouthful of Crisco.)An unexpected extra benefit came at the end of a day of car maintenance that demanded maximum dexterity and sacrificial fingers. Several gloveless hours of nicks, cuts, and blisters were taking a toll. Out of desperation, I slathered on some coconut oil. The stinging stopped almost immediately. The relief lasted until I washed my hands. Placebo effect or not, it really seemed to help.I'm impressed. I received a complimentary 15-ounce jar for evaluation, used it extensively in various capacities, and I still have most of it left. I wonder how it would do as a leather conditioner....",5
I bought this to use as a hair conditioner and I am thrilled with the results. My hair is shinier and looks healthier. Just make sure you shampoo AFTER using it. Maybe twice. It's lightweight and works great.,5
"We've been using natural, cold pressed coconut oil for several years as an occasional cooking oil replacement and dietary supplement. My wife has been battling ovarian cancer off and on since 2008 and my father has early stage Alzheimer's disease. While none of us are expecting a cure for either disease, there is some promising research that indicates the ketones found in naturally processed, cold pressed, virgin coconut oil have been found to prevent or slow the the progression of Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases. Yes, these studies are not conclusive and there is a lot of debate on just how healthy coconut oil is for you, but when you have an incurable and terminal disease, it makes sense to make any small change you can in your behavior or diet that might have even a small benefit.That being said, our family started adding a little coconut oil to our daily diet. We use it as a replacement for butter and other cooking oils when it makes sense to do so, and my wife has found that it's one of the few things that has been able to help her dry, cracked heels. We've been using Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and have been very happy with it, so when Robert Moore of Viva Labs contacted me and asked if I'd be interested in trying and reviewing a sample his coconut oil, I was eager to try out another brand of a product that we have come to love.The two different brands of coconut oil seem to be of nearly identical quality, which says a lot for Viva Labs product, because I hold my usual brand (Nutiva) in such high esteem. I compared the two products side by side in scent, taste, texture and cooking performance. Like all pure coconut oil, it melted at 76 degrees F, and I was able to heat both oils to 350 degrees F without the oil beginning to smoke. I made temperature measurements with a LT300 Infrared Thermometer from manufacturer Sixth Sense. I conducted a blind taste test with some of my family member and the results were as follows: Between the Nutiva and Viva oils, everybody (including me) thought the Viva Labs oil was smoother and creamier, but two people felt the Nutiva brand had a stronger coconut smell and taste, while one felt the Viva oil had stronger coconut smell and taste.In conclusion, I was very pleased with the Viva Labs coconut oil. All of my taste testers like the oil and we all agreed that it was smoother and creamier than our highly rated usual brand.",5
"I tend to use heavier cream on my hands because my eczema can get pretty bad. I stopped using the heavier cream and instead began using this coconut oil. I was pleasantly surprised that despite being oil, it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. Well, as long as I use it in moderation.The odor is light, but definitely smells like what you expect. It's a light coconut smell and is pleasant enough.The texture, at room temperature, is solid, but quickly melts when you put your finger into it. On warmer days, this has actually been far more liquid than solid, which is OK since you really want it to be the liquid form when trying to put it on your hands.It also works really well on dry elbows and knees.I did not consume any of the oil or use it in my hair.Recommended for short term relief of eczema, though you will want heavier cream when you have a larger flair up.Disclaimer: I received a free sample for review purposes. I review everything I receive as if I've paid for it. I will buy more when the sample runs out.",5
"Multi- purpose and useful in each of its recommended ways, Viva Labs Coconut Oil is a pure, natural, organic certified non- GMO product ready to use. It is non- refined and can be used as food or as an aid to healthy skin and hair, making it one of the most useful products in your kitchen or night stand drawer.I have used a few other coconut oils, usually for cooking, but this is one of the few I have ever tried that is so versatile. The first time I used this coconut oil was on my hands- they were feeling a little dry from handling paper all day on the job and I decided to reach for this product instead of the lotion I would normally use. I found this to be superior to the lotion and it quickly brought an end to the dryness. It doesn't dry in as quickly as a lotion, but it works better. I haven't tried it on my hair, as I have thinner hair than most and I would likely not benefit much, but it does seem like a good moisturizing product for this purpose.This extra virgin coconut oil is also useful for eating and cooking and it makes a good substitute for butter and other dairy products. About the only possible strike, from a consumption perspective, is the high level of saturated fat. This is true with other coconut products as well and it is expected. But it could be a concern to those who are trying to cut back on saturated fat as, according to the label, a single tablespoon contains 13 grams of saturated fat. Yes, the product does taste delicious and the type of saturated fat contained here is not as bad as that in other foods, but try to keep the use to a minimum if you're on a low fat diet.Softer skin and great tasting- you don't find many products that take care of both the inside and outside of your body. Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is one product that does it all and my experience has been very positive on all levels. It is an excellent product that wins my highest recommendation.",5
"I was asked to review organic coconut oil from Viva Labs and happily accepted!  I love using coconut oil for beauty as it has so many uses.  I received a sample of Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil to review in exchange for my honest opinion.About the product:Viva Labs Coconut oil is Organic and made with non-GMO coconuts.  Their coconut oil is raw, extra-virgin and cold-pressed by their supplier in the U.S.  The containers are BPA-free too.Ever since I became pregnant in 2005, it made me reconsider how I clean and use beauty products.  I started researching how to clean with natural products that are safe to use around my family.  I also found mineral makeup, which is made from natural ingredients.We have slowly started adding organic, natural and some gluten-free products.  While do not eat 100% organic, natural or gluten-free, I will choose either if there is an option.  For the last few months, we have been doing our grocery shopping primarily at a natural grocery store that is known for reasonable and affordable prices.  The employees are so nice too.  It is always such a treat to shop there.I use coconut oil in the following ways:Eye makeup removerMoisturizerSkin moisturizerLeave in conditionerDeep conditioner for hairI can easily use coconut oil as a deep conditioner for my hair.  I apply to my scalp and run it through my hair all the way to the ends and leave in for as little as an hour and then wash.  I can also leave it on overnight for a deeper conditioner; it is really up to you.Are your feet looking dry?  Use coconut oil.  Have a bug bit?  Apply a little coconut oil to the area to ease the itch.I love using coconut oil for just about everything beauty related.  Using coconut oil for beauty allows me to save money on having to buy separate products such as eye makeup remover, lotion, moisturizer and more.On a budget?  Use coconut oil for just about everything beauty!  Coconut oil is natural and gentle on the skin.",5
"The Viva Labs Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil is great!  I really enjoyed testing the oil for so many different uses to find what worked best for me.  I absolutely love using this oil as an eye cream, makeup remover and face moisturizer.  My face looks and feels incredible!  I also enjoyed using it as a night-time hair ""serum.""  I apply a small amount to the bottom 1/3 of my hair and wash it in the morning.  It feels so soft, silky and looks shiny.  The oil does a great job for hair masks, but was simply too much for my hair to handle.  I highly recommend trying out coconut oil as part of your beauty/skin care routine.  This should be an essential oil every girl has in her cabinet!I found SO many great ways to use the oil.  Check out my trials and thoughts here - hilybeehive.blogspot.comThis product was sent to me for review consideration.  All opinions are my own.",5
"In the past, I bought a few cheapie Coconut Oil products to use on my dry skin and dry hair. They did fine for that and that was that. So when I was I received a 15-oz. container from Viva Labs free in return for an honest review, I decided to test it for cooking, baking and for skin and hair. Even before I received my jar, I went online and read many articles about the benefits of Coconut Oil before I opened the jar.Below is a list of my findings are regarding this jar of Viva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil:1) It has a very delicate smell and taste. Of course the first thing I did upon opening the jar is that I smelled it. And then I placed a spoon in the jar so that I could sample the taste. It had a taste of a fresh coconut, but it was not overpowering. I had to know this before I attempted to bake with it.2) Baking with this product - So I went online to see how to use the Coconut Oil instead of my usual corn oil that I use to bake cupcakes with. Result: The cupcakes tasted lighter, and they were fluffier than before. So I brought these to a function that I attended and everyone raved about them and when I went back to grab a second one, none were left!3) Frying with this product - For me, I was a die hard Olive Oil (Regular) fan, but no more! Fried four small catfish with this as well as used LA Fish Fry and what can I say? First, the fish browned evenly and also that fish was the best I have fried yet!4) Dry Skin - So I scooped out 1/4 teaspoon for my dry hands and elbows and rubbed this in. It smoothed my dry palms wonderfully and my elbows are smooth again.5) Dry Hair - I placed 1/2 teaspoon of this in a small bowl and worked it into my hair BEFORE I shampooed and then shampooed as normal. Then I blew my hair dry and styled it. It was shinier without being over conditioned.So this jar does have so many uses. And of course there are many, many health benefits as stated on the Dr. Oz show. Benefits as helping thyroid function, help with blood sugar, great for the heart, it serves as an antioxidant for the body and more...So I recommend this product highly! For me, this product works better than the other Coconut Oil brands that I have tried in the past and when I use all the contents of this sample jar, I intend to order this same product again.",5
"I have tried quite a few different coconut oils, after reading about how good they are for your body and skin and hair.  I have never found one that either didn't smell weird, wasn't to greasy or chalky or that tasted all right.  This Extra virgin Coconut Oil from Viva Labs is so different than any other oil I have tried.  It smells like coconut, real coconut, not some nasty smelling oil.  I tasted a teaspoon based on reading that it is good for you and it did not taste bad at all.  Of course I love coconut, so that may have helped.  I am also using this on my skin as a moisturizer, and let me just say you only need a very little bit, and rub it in thoroughly, a little goes a long way.  I had a fear that I would smell strongly of coconut after using this as a skin moisturizer but do not smell like a coconut and my skin is quite moisturized.  I live in a dry climate and am always using oils to hydrate my skin and hair, and right now, this is what I am using with fantastic results. I am very happy with this coconut oil, and am going to make brownies today using this oil rather than vegetable oil.  A friend told me it will make my brownies much better, so we will see.  I am going to continue using this oil and would recommend it.  I like that it is organic and I like the results of using it.",5
"I love coconut everything.  When I was a kid I would sneak into the pantry and eat coconut flakes from the bag with a spoon.  As an adult I always choose an entree and dessert that has coconut in it.  When I discovered coconut scented bath products I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  Once I tried the Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by Viva Labs I realized I had finally found a versatile product I could use in so many ways.I began by using the coconut oil on my dry, dry skin.  I'm getting older so regular moisturizers were not working as well as they used to.  I scoop some of the oil in my hands and apply it liberally to my face and neck.  My dry skin soaks it right up so it's even safe to use before I go to bed.  No stains on my pillow!Another way I use it is by adding it to my bath water.  Bubble baths with scent can actually be drying but by replacing the bubble bath with the coconut oil I come out of my bath moisturized and glowing.  I've used the coconut oil during cooking and I love the light taste it imparts to food.  I have yet to use it on my damaged hair and scalp but that is my next product.I really love the Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by Viva Labs.  You can use it to replace many products for cooking and your cosmetic needs so that in the end you'll be saving money.  That is what I call a real winner!As a disclosure I did receive full-size jar of the Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to use and review.",5
"I love this stuff!  I recently entered into the world of coconut oil and was happy to have the opportunity to try this product.Why I love this coconut oil:* First and foremost, its quality.  Even the nutritional contents show this.  The nutrition:Cal = 125Fat=14Saturated Fat=13Polyunsaturated Fat=.1Monounsaturated Fat=.7Medium Chain TriglyceridesLauric Acid=7210 mgCaprylic Acid=906 mgCapric Acid=836 mgOmega-6 polyunsaturated fatsLinoleic Acid=104 mgOmega-9 monounsaturated fatsOleic Acid=714Certified Organic, extra virgin, non-GMOI've never seen such a detailed nutrient list on other coconut oils.  Medium chain triglycerides are different than the long chain triglycerides found in the typical American diet.  They are more easily digested differently than other fats.  As with everything though, moderation is key.Omega-6 and Omega-9 fats are good fats and help protect against metabolic syndrome and heart disease.* The yummy taste and smell.  This coconut oil seems smoother than other oils that I've tried.* My athletic performance has improved.  I'm an avid exerciser, who cycles between heavy weight training and intense cardio.  I feel I have more energy when I use this product.  Plus, it helps keep me full.As healthy as this product is, it is high calorie, so moderation is key.  I make a post-workout snack of 1 teaspoon coconut oil, 20 raw almonds and 20 dried tart cherries.  This snack is particularly effective when I'm kayaking, since I'm out for several hours.  This snack keeps me well-fueled.I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a delicious and nutritious supplement to their diet.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.",5
"I am an avid user of coconut oil for it's health benefits.  It is nectar of the gods in my book. I am also very picky about the brand I use and have always used Nutiva to make sure I am getting top quality that does not contain anything harmful or toxic by way of processing.  I have to say I was very skeptical to try this new brand, but when I opened the container and smelled the fresh aroma and the taste of coconut immediately, I was sold.  You can definitely see, smell and taste the quality of the product.  Viva Labs, you have a new coconut oil fan and customer.",5
"Wow! First off I want to talk about scent. I've used other coconut oils that might as well have been made of petroleum, as there was no scent at all. This oil has a subtle coconut scent to it. I used it to make a homemade salve which turned out perfectly! I love the smooth skin healing properties of this oil.The more I learn the more important quality and purity is to me. We are bombarded with pesticides and additives in everything we eat and put on our skin. It is nice to find a product which is just what it says it is. Now I am going to try this out with pop corn. Yum!",5
"I'm a big fan of coconut oil for cooking fish, just bread your favorite white fish and fry it up in coconut oil and you'll be a amazed at the taste.  It's like eating coconut shrimp. Plus, you can rub the coconut oil on your skin while cooking for soft skin that smells like you just came from the tropics.I've used a lot of coconut oil and Viva's is certified organic and GMO free.  It has a light, clean scent and tastes delicious straight from the jar.There are too many health benefits to mention, and I also take coconut gels every day, but one thing I'd like to mention is that if you follow the idea that foods resembling body parts are good for those body parts, coconuts look like a human head.  So I have to think that coconuts are good for both your brain and your hair, which of course the oil is good for the skin and hair on the outside, but I'm going with it being equally good for the inside of our hair and brain.Also, besides fish, and shell fish, coconut oil is great for popping popcorn.  It gives it a kettle corn flavor and again, it's a whole lot better for us than some of the other oils out there.Viva Labs makes an excellent product.  I'll be using this coconut oil from now on.",5
"My husband and I use a lot of organic coconut oil for baking and as an addition to vegetable dishes. This particular brand is certified organic and non-GMO. It has not been processed with hexane or bleach and it is cold-pressed. It has an excellent aroma and flavor.Normally I use Garden of Life because it comes in a glass jar. However, the plastic used here is free of BPA's.For those with allergies: The label on the coconut oil warns that it may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts.Coconut oil is a good substitute for non-organic butter and margarine made from hydrogenated fat (which produces inflammation in the body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste to almost any food it is included in, but especially curries, baked goods and homemade ice cream.Coconut oil is excellent for the skin. It moisturizes, protects and heals the skin, and it functions as a mild sunscreen. Its natural smell is heavenly, and it makes a wonderful massage oil. It can be used to condition the hair. When used as a mouthwash, the fatty acid it contains, lauric acid, kills harmful microbes, thereby helping prevent cavities and gum disease.We have, fortunately, moved past the era when consumers were wrongly warned to avoid coconut oil in their diet because it is a saturated fat. As it turns out, liquid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, worse, hydrogenated, solid PUFA, which consumers were advised to substitute for saturated fats, are truly awful for the health. Among other problems, they suppress thyroid and immune function and spread free radicals in the body. Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures. It is protective of the thyroid. It satiates hunger so you crave less food when you eat, and it raises the metabolism so that the body is more efficient in burning fat, especially the most dangerous kind, visceral, abdominal fat. It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds. It also insulates you from the effects of Staphylococcus Aureus (a very dangerous pathogen) and Candida Albicans, which causes yeast infections throughout the body.Coconut oil is classified as a ""fruit oil,"" and they are considered the healthiest oils around. Other fruit oils include avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil. Technically nut oils are also fruit oils, because a nut can, by one definition, be seen as a ""one-seeded fruit."" However, the reverse is not true of a coconut. Though a coconut is a fruit, is not truly a nut. A true nut, for example an acorn, does not open up when it is mature in order to release its seeds. Instead, the seeds are released when the walls of the fruit decay or it is eaten and digested by an animal and released onto the ground in the midst of animal waste. In contrast, a coconut has three pores or ""eyes"" at one end. Within these pores the coconut seed germinates and a shoot emerges from the pores much in the way shoots emerge from the ""eye"" of a potato.DISCLAIMER: I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs in order to test it out. I was under no obligation to write a review.",5
"Two tablespoons Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 1/2 cup popcorn kernels & my Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper with a sprinkling of salt equals the most delicious & aromatic popcorn ever!  Not only does my popcorn taste great with a light coconut flavor, but my home is filled with a delicious, tropical, light coconut aroma.Back in the day, old research warned us to stay away from coconut oil saying that the oil is full of saturated fats; however new research has determined the fats in coconut oil are a specific MCT (medium chain triglyceride) which have many health benefits.  If you google 'health benefits of coconut', you'll find lots of information promoting the healthy effects of coconut oil from helping our bodies mount resistance to both viruses and bacteria that can cause illness to  boosting thyroid function helping to increase metabolism, energy and endurance. There are other benefits that are still being tested such as relieving some Parkinson patients symptoms & it's being looked at as a help in dementia, but neither has been proven. Just be cautious, with all this information floating around the web, don't take too much coconut. Viva recommends 1 - 4 tablespoons a day, don't take more unless your doctor suggests it.  Large amounts can  cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.Coconut oil is  a product that I have been adding to my daily routine. From  cooking, skin care & as a dietary supplement, it's become part of my lifestyle. Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is the best I've used.",5
"Based on the thousands of reviews posted by Amazon customers, it's probably safe to say that by now most people are familiar with the debatable healthful qualities of coconut oil (the medium-chain triglycerides and its surprising paradoxical effect on cholesterol ratio), so why write another review? Well, I've been using a few different brands over the last five years, and the best one I've found is the organic extra virgin product sold by Viva Labs. While I don't use it much for eating--since I try to eat a low-fat diet of mostly raw fruits and vegetables, and most of the oil I consume comes from dining out--I have tasted Viva Lab's coconut oil and found it to be nutty and delicious like coconut oil should be. My primary use for coconut oil, however, is external. As someone who suffers from mildly dry skin, I have taken to using coconut oil instead of face and skin lotions because coconut oil has a nice slow absorption rate (yes, it's a little greasy, but that's a good thing) and unlike lotions that just give my patches of inflamed skin temporary relief, coconut oil actually *heals* the problem. And the best one I've used so far is this one: organic, extra virgin, velvety Viva Labs coconut oil. It also doesn't hurt that it's non-GMO and the container is labeled with all of the supplement data, from a full fat breakdown (saturated, poly, mono) to an index of medium chain triglycerides (lauric, caprylic, and capric acid), and omega 6 and 9. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line coconut oil, look no further.",5
"I am an avid coconut oil user. It's the only substance I use on my skin besides soap and water, I cook with it, I rub it on the chests of my children when they are ill (it's an immune booster), my teens use it on their acne (it's anti-microbial) and we take it as a supplement to boost our low thyroid.I like the texture and feel of Viva. It is dense but light. It has a faint coconut smell and its taste is even lighter. I would prefer a deeper coconut flavor for baking and taking as a supplement but Viva's light fragrance works well for cooking and frying.I do question the label ""Extra Virgin"" because my understanding (and, according to another coconut oil producer) is that coconut oil cannot be ""extra virgin"" because they do not press the coconuts in the same way that olives are pressed. However, be that as it may, as long as it is virgin and organic...I'm happy.When the coconut industry collapsed back in the 1970's to 1980's (after consumers were led to believe that coconut products were bad for their health), thousands of people lost their livelihoods. The Philippines were hugely affected. This is one reason why I love Viva Coconut oil. I want to support and help revitalize an essential industry and, ultimately, help put food on someone's table. With eight children, myself and my husband using coconut oil as well as telling everyone we know about it, I'm pretty sure our dollars will add up.Viva Labs was started in 2011 by a team of nutritionists, doctors and homeopaths who are committed to helping you and I get (and stay) healthy. I like the sound of this company and I do recommend this product!",4
I was initially skeptical about this product as it's packaged inplastic. I prefer to buy all fats and oils in glass since plastic'slipophilic. I've used it on my hair and skin for about a week now andmy skin drinks this up. My face stays moisturized for about 3-4 hrsbefore I have to reapply. Best of all -- there are no scary carcinogensto worry about. Will try as a butter substitute in home-made cakes.Cooking with saturated fats like coconut oil and butter is healthierthan using vegetable oils. Saturated fats don't turn rancid as easilyas vegetable oils.I read that coconut oil alone might be sufficient as a sunblockso will try using this instead of my usual spray next summer.I'd previously used Coconut Pacific (glass jars) but it wasdiscontinued. VIVA LAB'S texture is softer than Coconut Pacific's.VIVA LABS is far better quality than the name-brand jar I bought atlocal health foods store. Definitely a frugal and healthy purchase :),5
"This is AMAZING coconut oil. The smell is so delicious, smells somehow more ""pure"" and healthy than the other oils I've tried. And you can't beat the price. I'd give if fifteen stars if I could. Highly, highly recommended. I'll be hooked for the rest of my life!",5
"I have purchased other coconut oils to use for cooking, but more often for my hands and feet before bed. Viva Labs' is by far superior to others I have tried, mostly because the other products were refined and I learned the difference after trying Viva's. Pure (unrefined) coconut oil retains more of the phytonutrients as well as the light coconut flavor. After using this product (just a tiny dab) on the heels of my feet, elbows, and cuticles, I'm impressed, as my skin stayed much softer the next day than other lotions, without all the chemicals. This product also doesn't seem to harden at room temperature (fall/winter room temp) as much as the others, which is important when you're using it to slather on the skin. Overall, it's a great product; one tub should last a very long time.",5
"As a professional chef, I have very high standards for quality of the products I use in my cooking.  I tend to experiment with various brands of coconut oil and can say that Viva Labs Coconut Oil is amongst the best.  It has a pleasant aroma that salivates the palate, but not too strong that is over powering.  It's the perfect balance.  My only wish is that this product comes in larger sizes. However, for every day cooking at home the 15oz is sufficient for a family of four.",5
"I am a fairly new coconut oil user, but I've tried several different brands over the past year and have found Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to be top notch.  It seems to stay liquid at lower temperatures than other brands, which makes it easier to use when taking it by the spoonful or using it in frying.  I have been using a little to fry my eggs every morning and it tastes great.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product.",5
"Coconut oil seems to come from two philosophies: 1) Keep it neutral and flavorless for versatility. 2) Keep the coconut flavor, since that is a reason to use the oil in the first place.  Viva Labs coconut oil is more on the latter side.  I think both types have their use.  This oil is particularly great for eating as a supplement, both because of the bright, fresh flavor and the pleasant texture at room temperature.  Because the flavor is relatively strong, it does clash with some savory dishes, where I would prefer the more neutral type of oil.  However, for skin, health, and sweets, I give this a high recommendation.",5
"8-Reasons I Go Crazy For Viva Coconut Oil:1.Anti-Bacterial,Anti-Fungal,Anti-Viral(Supports Immune System)2.Rich in Lauric-Acid:Eats Odor Causing Bacteria/Under Arm B.O.  (Useful Tip) Oil makes a Great Deodorant3.Protects & Conditions:Hair,Skin,& Nails4.Raises HDL Count (HDL=The Good Fats)5.Increases Metabolism Enough for Noticed Weight Loss (Fat Loss)6.Safe for Cooking with out Destroying Oils Nutritional Profile7.Helps Maintain Healthy / Normal Glucose Levels8.Extremely High in MCT's Levels (Amino Acid Profile)",5
"I was asked by Viva Labs to try their product, so I will be upfront about saying that I got it free from the company.  I'd never used coconut oil before.  I'm not a believer in vitamins or health food supplements, so I didn't use it for that.  I do believe in eating healthy, and even a doctor I know spoke well of coconut oil.  The sample I got had a very faint coconut scent.  Our house has been hovering around the 50-70 degree mark, and this product has stayed liquid.  I tried it as a skin softener, because I have very dry skin.  It did briefly soften my dry skin.  It worked about the same as olive oil does on me.  My Great Danes were attracted to the smell, and wanted to lick it off of me.  It really doesn't have any lasting skin softening effects for me.  I also tried it for cooking.  I really didn't care for the taste this oil gave my food, and prefer olive oil for cooking.  Additionally, the packaging really isn't conducive to cooking.  When I tried to pour some into a pan, a lot of the product slopped down the side of the jar, and I had to get a paper towel to wipe it off.  Would I spend $9.25 for a 15 ounce jar, plus shipping?  Quite honestly, no.  Some people may like this product, and some may believe that it has some health properties.  For me, I just was not impressed with the product or packaging.  Sorry Viva Labs, I don't think I'd be a customer.",3
"I've been using refined and unrefined coconut oil for a long time.. I think they each have their place.  I'd use the refined more for cooking.  The unrefined is identical in appearance and use but has a coconut smell.  This is good for a butter replacement, both types are good for skin care.  I suspect the unrefined has more health benefits though.",5
I live in the Midwest...needless to say we have had a brutal cold winter!!! I use this product everynite and my skin is in love.,5
"I use this stuff for everything. Smells good, tastes good, looks good. And you can't beat the price! Would definitely buy again.",5
Its exactly what was expected.  Use it daily.  The quality us the best.  No surprises just as the marketing said it would be.,5
"I'm eating it, I'm using it as a hair conditioner, it sealed in my hair color, I use it after shaving, I use it as a night mask on my face, I use it as a heel and elbow cream and I use it on my dogs feet and ears. This product is incredible!",5
"you only need a little bit, and it's supposed to be really good for you..I like the taste better t han olive oil.",5
"I use this for my hair and skin.  I have naturally curly hair that is kinda dry and this helps with split ends and helps my hair look shinny and healthy. I also use it for a leave in conditioner occasionally.  It smell great too!  I works great to put on as lotion and keep my skin nice and soft.Some users mentioned that it left their hair really oily, which does happen if you use a ton, but that's to be expected since it is and oil.I was using refined coconut oil before and it is no comparison to this!  I recommend this produce, especially if you have dry hair.",5
"We love this oil very good to the taste and smell, it is being used every day would recommend it to anyone. 100% satisfied with your product",5
I purchased this coconut oil to use as a base for making creams with essential oils and it works great. Fast shipment and a great product!,5
"This is a pretty good Coconut oil for the price. I can get better quality at comparable prices but since no one beats there customer service, I buy this at this website because it is the only large size they carry.",4
"I like it organic and unrefined. However, I'm disappointed the oil came in a plastic container. The coconut oil has a bit of the plastic taste to it. I'll stick with another brand that comes in a glass bottle.",3
"When I opened the product, I could smell the coconuts and I imagined myself on a tropical island drinking a pina colada. The product was thick and hard but when I placed it on my skin it melted rather quickly. The smell was a bit overwhelming but it faded quickly. It takes a while for the product to be absorbed into the skin so it was a bit greasy. I have rosacea and many products can cause my face to become irritated  but the coconut oil did not cause my rosacea to get worse. I liked the taste but I did not get the opportunity to cook with it. Overall I was impressed with the product and I will continue to use it.",5
"1st is the packaging  the aluminum/plastic sealing has enough little tabs on the rim to peal it off fairly easily. I personally like to get the sealing materials off products. Some sealed products are difficult and messy to open. The first thing appreciated with Viva Coconut Oil is ease of opening.In my food research many people started exchanging coconut oil for butter. I purchased some at a local store for homemaking granola in several recipes. A few weeks later I am offered VIVA COCONUT OIL to try and review.VIVA COCONUT OIL is truly superior to local store findings.In this do a review process I learned coconut oil is not only good for skin on the inside and outside of ones body  coconut oil aids in memory . . . well - I sure wont forget that one!I have used this on my skin after showering in in my hair over night with a towel on my pillow. I am adding VIVA COCONUT OIL to my skin regimen.Then in my what to do next with VIVA COCONUT OIL  I found coconut oil fudge  oh my  fudge  I could hardly contain my excitement. If you are a chocolaholic VIVA COCONUT OIL IS FOR YOU . . . a little nutritional REDEMPTION indulging in fudge! One review said coconut fudge tasted JUST LIKE the insides of expensive truffles purchased at Costco. I agree.Many foods are just not worth the calories in my grading nutrition, calories, taste, etc. Now with VIVA COCONUT OIL  nutrition addition is wonderful.Replacing coconut oil in many baked confections (brownies, cookies, etc.) gives another aspect of nutrition. I have almost used up the sample. I used in a cookie recipe, baking at 325. Cookies turned out great. Research says 350 Fahrenheit or lower works. More than 350  coconut oil burns.  As holiday cookies are soon to take over the kitchen  I ordered four tubs of VIVA COCONUT OIL.I put dot in the web address where . goes, hopefully amazon leaves this coconut questions answers site for your viewing.http://answers.yahoodotcom/question/index?qid=20070807163746AA78iV6",5
"Viva Labs asked me to try and to review their Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil and the product sounded intriguing, so I agreed. I'm glad I did.For several years I've given myself an oil treatment using organic extra virgin olive oil. I decided to try an oil treatment after I read the way Queen Ester prepared for her ""One Night with the King."" Once a week, after my shower, I apply the oil and that treatment keeps my dry skin from turning rough and flaking. For the past few weeks, I have used the coconut oil instead of olive oil. I get the same result with the coconut oil as with the olive oil, but with a few differences.The coconut oil smells like coconut. (I know you're probably saying, ""Duh!"" but olive oil doesn't smell like olives...) The fragrance is light, so I find it pleasant.The coconut oil is a thinner oil. This increases the absorbtion into my skin, so less of it ends up on my clothes. The thinness also influences the temperature stability of the oil. If the room temperature is above about 75 degrees Fahrenheidt, the oil is liquid. (Be careful when opening the jar, I spilled some when I was removing the inner seal.) If room temperature is below about 75 degrees, then the oil becomes a grainy semi-solid. The oil liquifies quickly when rubbed on skin.I continue to use body lotion between treatments, but Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is skin care fit for a queen.",4
"Quality coconut oil is difficult to find and discovering one that is labeled ""organic"" is even more rare. But that's what you get from Viva Labs in this fabulous product. I have been loyal to a specific brand of coconut oil for many years since I adopted a healthy high saturated fat lifestyle. But now I am considering adding this product to my purchasing options. The aroma is pleasantly coconut, but not overly so. And people think coconut oil makes everything taste like coconut, but not necessarily. The same goes for this one. If you are looking to add in healthy fats to your diet, this product does the trick.",5
"I seldom receive a product that claims to be good for my skin, my hair, a nutritional supplement and a product that can be used for cooking.  I liked it more for pedicure and manicure then as a skin lotion as it tended to sit on my skin and needed to be massaged into my skin. It did make my hair soft and shiny. Baking is not in my culinary repertoire, so I will have to take the makers word for that. I don't ingest oils of any kind except maybe fish oil in capsules. So there you have it. If I lived on a desert Island this would be the one item I would take with me. In fact, I presume that is where all these uses were discovered.",4
"I was a little skeptical about using the coconut oil as part of my beauty regimen but I thought I would give it a try. The first way I used it was as a moisturizer. It was a little greasy by itself but worked wonderfully when I mixed it 2 to 1 with my normal body lotion. My skin felt fantastic and I retained the moisture longer than when I used just my lotion.The second way I used the oil as part of my beauty regimen was to use it as eye makeup remover. It left my eyelashes a little greasy but that washed away easily the next morning when I showered. I love this as an alternative to my regular make up remover because it's all natural.Lastly I used the oil to tame fly-aways in my hair. For this I just used a super tiny amount that I rubbed in my hands first then ran my hands through my hair. It worked okay initially but then those stubborn hairs popped back up after moving my hair around so I wouldn't recommend it for this use.I also took the time to use the oil for cooking just to be thorough. As far as using it for cooking I loved the fact that the oil does not flavor the foods I'm using it with. I used it for popcorn, flautas and empanadas and it cooked my food with no issues.Overall this is a great product and that I will continue to buy and use.",5
"This product worked great for sauteing, baking, and as a body lotion.Sauteing - I used it in place of canola or olive oil to cook breakfast sausage, onions, garlic, the list goes on. Although it smelled like coconut while cooking, I didn't think the food tasted like coconut. I think that's a plus because it makes it so much more versatile.Baking - was the same. I could only detect a slight coconut taste. I'm not sure I could have it I didn't already know that coconut had been used. I think water disperment is the best method of measuring it since it's solid.Body Lotion - this may be the best moisturizer I've ever used! I have VERY dry skin so if it works for me, it's good stuff. It went on really easily, it melts quickly from body heat. It smelled like yummy coconut doing on but the smell dispersed quickly so I didn't feel like I walked around all day smelling like a pina colada.I highly recommend this versatile product!",5
"I'm a big fan of coconut oil and use it for both cooking/baking and skin care. There are a variety of brands on the market, and some are better than others. Being the type of person that I am, I always like trying new products to see how they compare to my current products, so I gladly agreed to try the Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil when offered a sample to review.When it comes to coconut oil, there are some that smell and taste like coconut oil (some more than others), and then there are others that don't have the coconut smell/taste. I personally prefer the ones that smell/taste like coconut, but I do keep some coconut oil on hand that doesn't have the taste for cooking purposes when I don't want delicate foods to have any coconut flavor. When I opened up the Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil jar, the lovely coconut smell made me smile. I had to taste it to see if the taste could compare to the aroma. I was pleased to see that it had that light coconut flavor that just melts on your tongue.Like other coconut oil, it is solid at room temperatures below 76 degrees F. Unlike many oils, coconut oil is shelf stable and does not easily go rancid. It's actually quite good for you taken internally or used externally. This particular coconut oil is cold-pressed and unrefined.Since I don't mind smelling a bit like the tropics, I used it on some wounds to help them heal quicker. I also use it lightly as a skin moisturizer at night. When I'm baking and grease the pan, I just rub the extra oil into my skin instead of washing it off.Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of the Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil and would have no issue purchasing it in the future. The only downside is that I need a larger bottle because I use so much of it.***I received a sample of this product, but a review (positive or negative) was not required. All opinions are my own.***",5
"I wasn't sure if I should refrigerate so I did, this was a mistake because it was too hard to spoon.I really liked the oil and use it for frying vegetables and the like.Because I love coconut it would not have mattered if there was an after taste but there was none.All and all I would buy Viva Labs Coconut Oil again.",5
"I absolutely love this organic coconut oil.When used as a part of my skin care routine I found it to be deeply moisturizing without being heavy. I have very sensitive skin and it didn't cause any breakouts or irritation. I expected it to be greasy, but that was really not a problem. My skin absorbed it very quickly so it didn't leave an oily feeling or get on my clothing.It works great on eczema as well as heels, knees, and elbows.The light coconut scent is very refreshing.I also used this for cooking, which is why I would recommend buying two - one for the kitchen and one for the bathroom.I first made biscuits with this, using this in place of the butter and coconut milk instead of dairy milk. This biscuits came out light, fluffy, delicious, and completely dairy-free. It only leaves a very slight coconut flavor, which we found to be quite tasty.I also used it for sauteing vegetables, and it worked very well for that as long as you keep an eye on the heat. If it gets too hot it burns.This is one product they I look forward to using again and again.I must mention that I received a complimentary sample in exchange for an honest review.",5
"I've used this as a substitute for vegetable shortening (like Crisco) in baked goods. In particular I enjoy the added flavor and taste using this for biscuits. Like other shortening or fat products it can be heated to become an oil for cooking as well.Although this product has many uses outside of the kitchen, I have only used it for cooking, but highly recommend it as a high quality organic substitute for cooking oil and shortening.",5
"I was contacted to review this product and, as soon the Viva Labs representative confirmed to me that his company did not test on animals, I accepted to give it a try. This is cold-pressed coconut oil. No perfume, no dye. Completely organic, you can use it internally or cutaneously. In other words, you can use this coconut as a supplement, a moisturizer, or cook with it. Since I don't like the same pot to travel from the kitchen to the bathroom, and back (I don't necessarily want to find myself with flour on my face and look like a clown, or bake that special apple-curly hair pie), I decided to test it solely as a beauty product.Viva Labs Coconut Oil takes some getting used to and, had I not done some research on the net, I would still be wondering: Is it worth it? Unless you live in an overheated place, the product has the consistency of cold butter. This means that nail and finger digging is involved in order to catch some product and spread it on your face. This, too, can be annoying when you are used to creams and lotions that glide on your skin in no time. Would the woman --or man-- in a rush be patient with all this? Mm. That's when I found directions with a competitor. Soak the box in warm water for a couple of minutes, and voil! You will find some oil that will happily invade and feed your skin. I would advise Viva Labs to add similar directions on their box.To smell like something eatable needs some adaptation on your part, specially if you're a woman accustomed to perfumed applications. (Make sure you don't stand near a cannibal from the tropics when you apply your oil.)But the more you use it, the happier your skin feels. An excellent night cream, I even use it in the daytime now that I have turned the heater on and that the air inside is getting drier. I find that it enhances my complexion. And my hair loves it, thinks it's probably the best nourishment it ever received, adding shine and luster to curls.  And this, only by letting the oil rest thirty minutes on wet hair. People with dandruff or itchy scalps might want to give this a try. I learned recently that coconut oil can kill bacteria, viruses and fungi, and that it can also be used as a sunscreen.As mentioned before, I don't believe in bathroom and kitchen starting a dialogue with each other, so I have not cooked with or eaten this product as a supplement. I will have to get a new pot to do that. But here is what I found out: populations that eat a lot of coconut are very healthy. Coconut oil can increase your energy, and help you burn fat. It can reduce seizures (please do more research for details on that one) and boost brain function.Since image is everything these days, may I advise Viva Lab to create a more catching label? Different from the other coconut oil products on the market? I noticed other brands have very similar presentations. I am not sure this is the way to go.Otherwise, you'll get a lot for your money. It is one of the healthiest choices on the market.",4
"I received a bottle of this coconut oil from Viva Labs in return for an honest review. I made the decision to become a vegetarian about four months ago. I've tried various products that just didn't sit well with. I tried other coconut products like Coconut Milk and Coconut Water, and could not get past the taste. However, when I received this product in the mail, I read the packaging and did a little research. This 15 oz. jar does a ton. In addition to using this as a  supplement to butter in food recipes, I found that my skin stays moisturized when I apply it after a shower. I am a Diabetic, so I live with dry skin. This product was a lifesaver. In addition to dry skin, I have very dry hair. I've tried so many products, and with the exception of a few really expensive ones, none of them worked. This product allows me to wash my hair several times a week as opposed to once a week, and has helped with my breakage. I have not used this product for cooking, as I am waiting for the jar I actually ordered. Something about cooking out of the same jar that I use on my hair and skin that doesn't sit well with me. I plan on using the new jar for my holiday baking. I will post an update to this review, once the results are in.So far, I really can't find any cons about this product except the fact that I walk around smelling like coconuts, and it is an oily substance. If you're using on your skin, make sure you rub in really well and if you're using it as a hair treatment, make sure you wrap your hair tightly. I've had to turn a couple of pillowcases into dusting rags.If this products works with my baking and cooking recipes, it will be a permanent fixture in my home. Overall, this is a good and valuable product.",4
"I've tried this coconut oil as a hand cream, hair conditioner, and a moisturizer. I've fried eggs in it and used it in homemade soap. There are clearly more possible uses, and I look forward to continuing to discover them.The product smells wonderful, stays solid at room temperature, lasts for over a year without any special storage, and goes a long way. These characteristics, along with its versatility, make it ideal for camping or travel.Can it replace every product in your cabinets? Probably not. A lot of research and chemistry go into making products behave in ways that they won't accomplish naturally. So this coconut oil won't sink into your skin instantly like a high-end moisturizer or whip smoothly into cake icing like Crisco. As a natural product, it obviously has advantages over those laboratory products, so it's a fair trade-off.This coconut oil is Non GMO Project verified, certified organic, and packed in a BPA-free jar. A tiny amount will keep your hands silky or sautee your veggies, so the price is very economical. Definitely something every household should keep on hand.",5
This oil is the real deal. It works great in cooking and I can also use it on my hair and skin. It leaves my skin soft and supple and my hair mosturized. Must have product.,5
"I have only used the oil in granola, and did not notice much difference in taste.  However, I do hope to receive the health benefits the oil is claimed to give.",5
"I am a huge fan of coconut oil and I have tried a number of different kinds and brands.  I like sticking to organic ones and when I was asked to try this one...I eagerly said yes.I really do not use it as a cream or hair lotion or body lotion.  We use it strictly as a dietary supplement.  My husband loves it on toast in the morning, I use it when I saut chicken or veggies, and I also use it when I make popcorn.This particular brand seems to have a more pronounced coconut flavor but I don't mind that at all.So...I love this one and it will be my oil of choice from now on...oh...I do give it to my two purebred Tonkinese cats and they lap it up!  It is so good for their luscious coats!This is a winner.",5
"I know it's coconut oil, but I don't want to feel like I'm eating suntan lotion. This coconut oil hits a good balance of leaving only a mild coconut flavor when it's used. It tastes great on eggs in the morning or steak in the evening. It also adds an interesting flavor to fried rice. And because coconut oil is great for your skin, you can moisturize while cooking!*sample provided for review*",5
"No doubt, there is controversy about coconut oil. Dr. Oz loves it. Mayo Clinic is not a fan. Scientists point to a lack of consistent peer reviews in Dr. Oz's claims. So, pick a side. You can find support. I'm a big fan or non-GMO foods and organic products, so when Viva Lab offered to let me try a container, I agreed.My trial was not about the health benefits, but the taste. My husband is a chef, so we gave it a run. Right out of the container, it has a rich, coconut fragrance. I like coconut, so the aroma was a plus. High-heat sauting is not the best use for the oil--it has a fairly low smoke point. But there are lots of fats for sauteing. The first trial was in a low-fat banana bread recipe. The bread is usually dense--it's made with whole wheat flour and applesauce. The addition of the coconut oil gave it a wonderful aroma, and the bread was lighter-textured. The taste is deeper, making the most of the banana, which is a fruit that loves coconut.My second food use was in a dressing for fruit salad. Does fruit salad need dressing? Why not? One third coconut oil, one third lime juice, one third triple-sec (or Cointreau) and the zest of a lime whipped together in a blender until it emulsifies makes a great dressing. Poured sparingly over a salad of mixed melon and summer fruit was wonderful. Poured over fall fruit (plums, apples, pears) was even better. I didn't stop. A generous spoonful over steel cut oats is great for variety.  You can leave out the Cointreau and just do the lime and coconut oil and use it over grilled asparagus for a wake-up taste.Next, I used it as a moisturizer. The toughest test I could give it was my elbows--the ones I lean on all the time and forget to moisturize. Within a weak, the elbows were under control. As I was applying the coconut oil, my cat became very interested in what I was doing, and licked the oil off my elbow. I reapplied and ignored him. But the next night, he showed up again. He's a tuxedo cat and has dandruff. I let him lick a small amount (about a quarter teaspoon) off my hand. Within two weeks, his dandruff was gone.As to the controversy: Coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides which generally don't develop into adipose tissue. There are conflicting reports on whether it lowers the bad cholesterol.  On the claims that coconut oil helps you lose weight, Mayo Clinic says, ""However, coconut oil is high in calories and saturated fat. One tablespoon contains 117 calories and 13.6 grams of fat. Coconut oil has more saturated fat than lard does. Although eating coconut oil in moderation isn't likely to harm your health, it's not likely to help you lose weight either. For successful, long-term weight loss, stick to the basics  an overall healthy-eating plan and exercise.""I've found ways to use it that make the most of the fragrance and don't overload my diet with fat--that's just common sense. But I've found interesting uses for the oil and this won't be the last container I use.",4
"I recently read that coconut oil is a better alternative than lotion for your skin.  - Of course your skin is the largest organ of your body, so it stands to reason that we should be cognizant of what we put on it.  So when I first got this coconut oil, I got it with the intent of using it instead of lotion.  I should rewind a bit and mention that I've been cooking with coconut oil for some time now.  I've never been too excited about the flavor of the coconut oil I've purchased in the past, but then I don't typically eat it straight, so that's never really been a concern for me.  --Fast forward to when I received my shipment of Viva Labs coconut oil.  When I opened the jar I didn't expect to notice a difference between this product and any of the other coconut oils I've used. But I was pleasantly surprised.  I decided to do a little taste test comparison.  And from the standpoint of consuming this product, this product was hands-down 100% better than the product I typically buy at my health food store.  I mean I would eat this stuff straight...really, it's that good!  Because of the health benefits of coconut oil, I usually try to disguise it by putting it in my soups, oatmeal, etc.  But this stuff is so good, I recently even put it in some home-made chocolate bars and it was terrific.From the standpoint of a lotion, I'm starting to get the hang of using this product.  Coconut oil melts at about 79 degrees.  I keep my house a bit cooler than that, so it's a bit hard to get out of the container.  I've been using a little scoop to put the oil into my hands before I rub it onto my skin  (the oil starts to get runny the second it touches my skin and then it smooths on quite nicely).  It smells pleasant with only a faint hint of coconut, but I have noticed that if you use too much your skin can seem a bit oily after.  Not at all a problem, more an observation.  Overall, I love it and I think it is a great alternative to commercial products.  I've used it on my face and haven't noticed any problems there, which I thought I might.  It's not at all heavy.This is a great product and I highly recommend it.",5
I love to cook with coconut oil and find it hard to find sometimes but this coconut oil is the best ever. It is creamy and comes in a 15 oz jar. I is organic and all natural. In this day and age of processed foods and GMO's it is so important to find quality natural products at a reasonable price. I cook with this -I especially like to fry fish in it. I also use it as a filler in my morning smoothies to add a little good fat in my diet. It is also one of the best skin moisturizers I have used. I am elderly so my skin has a tendency to become dry especially around my nose. I just rub a little of the coconut oil on my skin and it keeps it from becoming red and painful. Great for a mask of moisture as well during the week or before applying makeup. Overall this oil is great and I recommend if you are looking for a good natural quality product look no further--Viva Labs has it all for you and with Amazon Prime you can have it in two days or less after ordering.,5
"We switched to coconut oil a number of months ago when we were trying to improve our diets.  Recently we decided to try Viva Coconut Oil because we are trying to eat more organic foods and we were looking for a higher quality coconut oil.  We have been delighted with this product.The oil is an excellent consistency for cooking.  It has a clear and clean coconut smell, but without being overpowering.  When we cook with it, we actually taste less of a ""coconutty"" smell on our food than we have with other brands.The bottom line is that this is more delicious, easier to cook with and healthier than other coconut oils that we have used in the past.  We will continue to use this for all of our cooking needs.",5
"I use coconut oil almost exclusively in cooking and enjoyed testing this brand - the aroma is very strong and the consistency and color is exactly what you would expect, and considerably more noticeable in comparison with the Sams or Costco bulk oils. This is organic, non-GMO certified and vegan and cooks up deliciously as an alternative to vegetable oil. You can apparently also use it as a moisturizer for hair and skin though I haven't tried this. If you're interested in cooking coconut oil, I'd recommend giving this a try - the smell alone is worth the purchase.",5
"I will state up front that the company approached me and asked if I would be willing to receive a jar in exchange for an honest review.  At first I was a bit hesitant since I have no prior experience with coconut oil except Palmin, a form of coconut lard, which my mother used for baking when I was a kid.  It had no flavor that I remember.But the company wasn't looking for an expert analysis, so I said yes.  The multi-use of the product was intriguing.Putting it in my hair was a bit of an adventure because I had to warm the oil in order to liquefy it sufficiently.  I have smeared olive oil, egg yolk, and honey in my hair before so this wasn't scary.  I liked the scent of the oil, and my hair did feel smoother and softer after I had washed it.  The real test for this will come in winter when the woodstove heat will dry my hair out no matter how many humidifiers are running.I am not a big fan of pan fried squash because it tends to sop up too much oil.  But for the sake of reviewing the oil I cut up yellow squash and green peppers and put in just enough hardened coconut oil to keep the vegetables from sticking.  The fragrance in the air was subtle but heavenly, and the squash browned with ease without turning to mush.  At the end I merely added a little Kosher salt so as not to miss out on the flavor.  No oily tasting squash, it tasted light and fruity.  I let my husband try some and he absolutely loved the flavor and texture.  It has been over an hour and no heart burn either...This product will be on my shopping list when this jar gets low.  We don't eat tons of meat or fast food, so I am not concerned with a little saturated fat.  I am much more likely to eat more vegetables because they taste so good with this oil, and that is a good thing.Absolutely, unbiased and wholeheartedly recommended!",5
"I received this product from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest review.  Initially I was reluctant to accept the product, only because I really have never used it and wasn't sure what to do with it.  Much to my surprise, the question now seems to be: ""What can't you do with coconut oil?""A quick online search will give you articles outlining hundreds of potential uses for this product.  I found that a bit overwhelming, so I stuck to the ones I'd look to the most: cooking, hair and skin care.COOKING:I tasted it out of the jar first.  Very pleasant. Light 'toasted' coconut flavor, with the consistency being smooth and light, despite the semi-hard consistency at room temperature.I used this product in both a shrimp stir-fry (about 1 Tablespoon melted before throwing in the ingredents), and it imparted a very nice coconut flavor to the dish.  Then I used it in place of Crisco in a cookie recipe, and loved the way the cookies turned out!  They too had a coconut flavor, but very light.  I'm sure the intensity of the coconut oil used has something to do with it, as does the amount used in a recipe.HAIR CARE:In place of Mogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2 fl. oz (60 mL) I used a small bit of coconut oil (melted).  I rubbed it between my hands and lightly went over the ends of my hair, being careful not to go to the scalp or use too much.  I found I enjoyed the scent, but despite adding a nice sheen, it seems a bit too oily to me for use in this way.  I think it's a matter of when the oil is applied and using less than you think you'll need, to get the desired effects for smoothing and luster.SKIN CARE:I put this on my hands and elbows at night.  I've noticed a nice change in the way both feel - moisturized and smoother - after about 3 days. I've also used it as a night-time facial moisturizer.  I note that it does go on slightly greasy, but by morning that greasiness is gone.  I've had no break outs of acne or similar, when using it in this way, but people with oily or combination skin may want to avoid using this product for a facial moisturizer as it is oil based. Consistent use on dry skin however, may eliminate dry patches and cracked skin.Overall, I'm very impressed with the quality of this product.  The price is on par with others in the marketplace, and it's organically certified, which gives me peace of mind about using it.I really like Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and I look forward to discovering new ways to use this product. I plan on investigating its dietary benefits a bit more to see if it would be beneficial to me (having high cholesterol) to add this to my routine. *Due to the high saturated fat content, I have not yet felt comfortable ingesting it on a daily basis until consulting with my physician.  Although it does not have any trans fats, which is a good thing!UPDATE:  10/18/13 - NEW USESI've added to my usage of this product: massage oil.  It smells wonderful and works great!  Because it doesn't absorb quickly into the skin, and you need very little, which emulsifies quickly - it's nearly perfect for this use.And hair conditioner... put on small amount on bottom half of your hair (not at the roots) when dry, leave on for 1/2 hour and then shower, shampoo and condition your hair as usual.  I add spray Argan oil to my hair when damp and blow dry, which I did in addition to this conditioning step with the coconut oil.  My hair felt soft, smooth and had nice shine.  Definitely feel it weighing down the hair though, so use sparingly!",5
"My wife uses this product and loves it.  She has been using it mainly as a supplement, but it truly has a half dozen different uses and does well in each one.  Frankly I was a tad skeptical but seeing her enthusiasm for it has made me a believer. Great product, reasonable price, and very versatile. Five stars all the way.",5
"I started using coconut oil in place of olive oil for cooking - now it's something I use for everything.  This oil is nice and smooth and doesn't have a strong odor, which is great when using it to soften skin or to condition your hair.  I use it in cooking everything on the stovetop, such as sauting onions or pan frying some pork chops, and it never leaves a coating or adds an unwanted taste.  It's a really versatile product and can be used in baking as well as taken as a daily supplement (those with thyroid problems like me should really check into using coconut oil).  Taken alone as a supplement, it's easy to take a few spoonful's with no bad aftertaste.Received from manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.",5
"I'm a coconut oil fanatic and use it for EVERYTHING.  Viva Lab's Coconut Oil smells amazing - very fragrant.  The texture is fine and smooth, very creamy and easy to spread or combine.  Tastes wonderful alone and as a cooking oil.  I'm very impressed.  And it's white as white can be (I've returned coconut oil that was yellow - which I've read happens if it's heated too extensively).Packaging reads: Free of pesticides, bleach, hexane and trans fats.  USDA certified organic.  Non GMO.  Unrefined, extra-virgin, cold pressed.My son and I both take a spoon full of coconut oil a day by itself.  We both enjoyed the taste, texture and fragrance.Cooking - the oil smelled nice as it heated.  I fried up some eggs and they turned out great!Products - I made a garlic salve for colds with 1/3 cup and refrigerated.  The coconut garlic concoction spread easily and worked well.  We put it on our feet, then put socks over it, at the first sign of cold/flu.I also made a divine lotion - Viva Coconut Oil, shea butter and magnesium flakes (melted in water to make oil) .  I love it!Last, but not least, I put a small amount on my face as a moisturizer, which my face soaked up immediately.  I have super dry skin and my pores thanked me for the moisture.  Happy to report no break outs, which can happen for me with coconut oil in problem areas - so now I avoid any contact with my chin/jawline.Very happy with this coconut oil and highly recommend for this price point.Other coconut oil I have on hand:Costco's Carrington Farms Coconut Oil - this coconut oil is less fragrant, and while I use massive amounts for cooking and baking, I have returned it for turning yellow.Louana's Coconut Oil - this is a cheaper coconut oil and again less fragrant, but it's not organic, nor does it confirm or deny bleach or processing.Spectrum Organic, Unrefined coconut oil - while organic and unrefined, I'm not as in love with the taste of this coconut oil and have used this more for a hair conditioner.",5
"I tend to start with the bad, so I might as well start with the bad here.  The bad: I think they pack this oil at a very low altitude.  When I opened my jar, solid coconut oil began to squirt out like I had popped a giant tropical zit.  The jar was definitely overpacked.  That's the only bad thing I discovered about this oil.Beyond that, it's mild coconut oil.  By mild, I mean the coconut smell and flavor is pretty muted in this particular brand.  I tested it with popcorn, my primary use of coconut oil.  Some brands have a much stronger smell and taste.  This oil was quite mild.  Not quite mild enough to call it flavorless, but mild enough it might not impart the taste of coconuts to food you don't want coconut flavor in.I like the price this oil sells for on amazon, it's quite affordable.It gets four stars because I think the packaging is hideous.  Partly because of how overpacked it was, and partly because the marketing blurbs on the bottle look like they are trying to cater to the crazy-person fringes of the health food movement.  If I could give 4.5, I would.Viva Labs gave me my jar of coconut oil in exchange for a review of the product.  I'm not sure why, as they had 151 stellar reviews already before mine.",4
"When I was sent a jar of this product and asked to review it, I jumped at the chance because I've always been curious about coconut oil for its many different uses. I haven't used it long enough to really give a full review. However, so far, I have used it in two different ways without complaints.(1) I have been swallowing one teaspoon each morning as a supplement to help my immune system. It quickly goes from a solid to a liquid in my mouth. While I am not a huge fan of coconut, and this oil has a definite coconut taste, it is not horrible tasting. For those who like coconut, I'm sure it would taste really good to them.(2) I used it as a moisturizer on several spots on my skin. A little bit goes a long way, so don't use too much! It has worked fine for me in this way, and I will use it again.",4
"Now, this caution isn't just for this brand of coconut oil, but the package says ""Excellent for cooking up to 350F"".  That makes me cautious for using it to saute' vegetables or some other pan cooking that others say they have used it for.  This is virgin oil, meaning it has not been refined.  Refined coconut oil has a smoke point of 450F. Virgin has 350F.It does add a lovely taste to baking and is particularly nice in a pie crust, but I mainly use it externally.  It smells wonderfully (it makes me think of Mounds bars) and goes on smoothly. Great product, but don't try to use it for frying anything or you will not only negate many of the health benefits, but you will get some nasty smoke.",4
"I've been using it instead of olive oil and it is delicious. I've also put it on my very dry hands,  besides feeling great,  it smells good. I never thought about using coconut oil before, boy have I been missing out. I highly recommend you at least give it a try, you won't be sorry.",4
"This all-natural, organic coconut oil has many uses from beauty to cooking; I have been using it as a moisturizer, and it works wonderfully. As the weather gets colder, I tend to get dry skin. Applying just a little bit of this delicious-smelling oil each day has completely eliminated that problem, and I love the pleasant but not overpowering coconut scent. Its texture is rather like Vaseline; be sure to store the container in a cool place, as it will somewhat liquefy if you do not. In addition to making it a staple of my skin care routine, I have also tried massaging a small amount through my hair before washing it, which had a nice moisturizing effect (though it was difficult to apply it evenly). All in all, this is a great beauty product that will not harm you or the environment. I plan to keep using it daily.",5
"Coconut oil is an amazing oil.  I've used it for cooking, making skin cream and even making surfwax.  Over the years I've ordered a lot of top grade coconut oil and this is as good as any of them. It smells like you just cracked open a coconut.  It feels great on dry skin. Viva sent me this oil to review.  Actually I asked him not to send it because I already had a bucket of oil in the garage but I'm happy he did.  This is top quality extra virgin.",5
"I have heard a lot about the multiple benefits and uses for coconut oil, and I was delighted to try Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, a pure, high-quality product that is a pure pleasure to use. With a mild, pleasant coconut aroma and taste, this product is truly amazing in its versatility. The first thing that I did was to try a spoonful, and it has a delightful, buttery-light coconut flavor. The next thing I did was to rub a small amount of the coconut oil on my ""working hands"", using an extra amount on the cuticles. The heat of my hands immediately liquefied the coconut oil, and it instantly absorbed into my skin. My hands felt softer and smoother, were pleasantly-scented, and not greasy at all. Since I constantly use my hands, especially on the keyboard and handling paperwork, I can't use any product which will leave a residue. Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil can also be used as a super-emollient, non-waxy lip balm. Since this coconut oil tastes so yummy, I took it to the kitchen and set my imagination in motion. It's wonderful with an added touch of cinnamon or nutmeg and spread on hot bread. I blended it with softened cream cheese and added some chopped nuts and dried fruit--delicious on bagels or graham crackers. I made Pineapple Scones (recipe below) and spread some of the coconut oil on the warm scones before serving, and I amped it up even further by blending the coconut oil with some softened real butter to spread on the scones as they were eaten. Pineapple and buttery coconut scones--so good! The health benefits of coconut oil are still being documented, and I would recommend visiting the Viva Labs website for nutritional information, usage, and recipes.Review Product Gratis Viva Labs Inc.PINEAPPLE SCONES3 cups flour1/3 cup sugar2 1/1 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp salt1/8 tsp nutmeg3/4 cup butter8 oz can crushed pineapple3 tbsp chopped almonds2 teaspoons milk2 tablespoons sugarIn mixing bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.

"This Coconut Oil is organic and comes in a 15 ounce container. It is absolutely pure, fresh and smells amazing if you like coconut. I personally love coconut and was happy to try cooking with it. However I wondered whether or not it would be useful for very many things. I am still fairly new to coconut oil but I have been experimenting with it a lot in recent months and have found it to be my new favorite oil to cook with. I have used it to fry things in a skillet like ham. I wondered if it would taste weird but it didn't at all and I actually preferred the taste to using vegetable or canola oil. I have also used it in deserts and that is what I prefer to use it for. I have used it to make homemade fudge and it turned out really good. Yesterday I used it to make chocolate chip cookies and they were some of the most amazing cookies that I have ever had. Coconut Oil can also be used as a beauty product. If you take a little bit of it and rub it into your skin it moisturizes and makes your skin very smooth. My hands always dry out and crack as the weather turns colder out. A little bit of this coconut oil makes them feel like new again and it smells great too.This is only the second type of coconut oil that I have tried but it seems perfect quality to me. It also has a long shelf life of about 1 1/2 years according to the expiration date on the top of the container. Coconut oil may not be for everyone but I love the taste and it's much healthier than many of the other options.Sample provided for review.",5
"I grew up thinking coconut oil was bad for you, like hydrogenated vegetable oils. I'm sure glad the truth is out, and that my family and I can now enjoy the extraordinarily positive health benefits of coconut oil.  I've tried several brands, and this Viva Labs was excellent, and at a very reasonable price point too. Of course it meets all the check points for being created the right way, things like cold pressed, not heated to high temps, organic, virgin, and so on. We're finding more and more recipes where this coconut oil adds a marvelous mild flavor that can't be beat, and it'll be in our kitchen always. Good stuff!",5
"This extra virgin coconut oil from Viva Labs is organic and non-GMO certified. It comes in a BPA-free plastic container which includes detailed product information. The oil tastes great and is known for many health benefits and for use topically for skin and hair as well. The product states that the coconuts are hand-picked in the Philippines, at peak readiness. This oil is reasonably priced for the quality delivered. The only caution with this is that it is made in a facility that processes other foods and can expose the user to trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts. If you are looking for very high quality coconut oil then Viva Labs provides an excellent product for you to consider.",5
Extra virgin coconut oil by Viva Labs is an organic 100% coconut oil that can be used for many purposes. It comes in a large size 15 ounce jar. This coconut oil has a mild scent and can be used for cooking and for hair and skin care. I have used it after my shower to moisturize my skin. It goes on smoothly and is very moisturizing. Leaves the skin smooth and soft. It's great for areas of the body with rough and dry skin like the bottoms of feet and elbows. It can also be used for it's nutritional value and taste when added to food. I am sure I will find a recipe to add this product to. 4/5 stars!!,4
"My friend used it and loves it. She had a bad tooth ache, and it reduced the pain by 90%. She is also using it to help expedite healing leg surgery. I am amazed at what she's telling me.",5
"We've been using coconut oil for a little over a year, for both our cooking and beauty needs. When approached about trying Viva Lab's Coconut Oil, I thought it would be great to compare Viva Labs with my current brand.Out of the box, Viva Lab's oil looked like any other coconut oil I've used. I immediately unscrewed the lid and took a sniff. N*tiva definitely has a stronger coconut smell, but that doesn't make Viva Lab's bad. In fact, I've avoided coconut oil in certain savory dishes, because I'd prefer a less fragrant presence of coconut. When my husband was faced with a blind 'smell test,' he thought the Viva Lab's Coconut Oil smelled lighter, but fresher.Taste comparison was about even - both oils were smooth and coconut-y, although Viva Lab's had lighter coconut flavor - again, not necessarily a bad thing.In beauty care, I thought Viva Lab's Coconut Oil was much smoother. It melted almost immediately on my skin, whereas N*tiva often leaves tiny 'chunks' that take awhile to soften and blend in.Overall, I was very pleased with Viva Lab's Coconut Oil. I have a bit of a coconut oil reserve at the moment, but when it's time to restock, I will seriously consider switching brands, despite Viva Lab's slightly higher price.*I received a complimentary jar of coconut oil from Viva Labs in exchange for an honest review. No other compensation was given, and all thoughts are 100% mine.",5
"Viva Labs OEV Coconut Oil is a quality product that I will use again. I like the user friendly bpa-free packaging and the short wide jar with the easy to open lid. This brand of coconut oil seems to be extra light and easy to apply to the skin, its clean vibration is felt on the body as it is absorbed even more so than with other coconut oils I've tried. Very nice for cooking too, great flavor.(dP)",4
"As a vegan, extra virgin coconut oil is worth it's weight in gold. It is wonderful to cook with and I have used it a number of times in things like vegan fudge etc. All oils have the same amount of fat, but if it's not coming from an animal, that works for me! Yes, there are liquid vegetable oils, but they don't have the same richness as coconut oil in my opinion.Believe it or not, it's also wonderful to massage into dry skin. Furthermore, what I like best about this oil is the smell. Coconut oils I have purchased in the past haven't had much of a smell. This brand is very aromatic and pleasing.My suggestion? By one for your pantry and one for foot/hand massage. Seriously.",5
"Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has surpassed my pre-conceived notions of  Coconut Oil benefits.  To date, I have cooked with it and have loved the results.  I have also used it as a hair conditioner, with great results as well.  I will continue to use this coconut oil for cooking, as it gives a lovely mild flavor to stir fry and baking.  As a hair conditioner, I cannot believe my hair has improved after just two uses.",4
"I have dry skin and spend a lot of time in the sun. I use coconut oil for my skin. This product is the best I've used.  It's very smooth while some of the other brands clump up.  Not too crazy about smelling like a pina colada all day, but hey, it's a small price to pay for organic, non-GMO rated coconut oil. Love this stuff.",5
"There are a great many suggested uses for coconut oil and I am not able to address all of them. It is apparently sovereign for hair-conditioning and is recommended as a butter substitute in baking. I did not address either of those issues. I did, however, try it as a butter substitute on a slice of toast, and found that agreeable, if not quite fabulous.It is excellent for sauting also, so long as one doesn't get carried away with the heat (up to 350 is the recommended range). As a bonus, things sauted in this oil acquire a pleasant, but subtle, taste from the coconut. I particularly liked this for shrimp, which when sauted plain tasted almost like coconut shrimp, without all the extra fuss and expense.This product is also recommended as a nutritional substitute - 1 to 4 tablespoons taken internally each day. Since I'm not an expert in this area, I can't really offer an opinion on that. There is some evidence that coconut oil is helpful with Alzheimer's disease. http://biggeekdad.com/20n12/02/coconut-oil-possible-alzheimers-treatment/Applied externally, it works very well for rough dry skin. I have problems at both elbows and heels, and this works very well for those problems. Be forewarned, however, coconut oil has a distinctive if somewhat subtle taste and smell - when you are applying it externally to your skin, you are not going to reek of it, but people with sensitive noses may notice.Overall, I think Viva Labs coconut oil, which is organic and extra virgin, is a high quality product.Some years back there were reports of health problems pertinent to coconut oil. The food industry is a very competitive one, and while I would not accuse the makers of other oils of a smear campaign, I can say that my reading indicates that there are places around the globe - the Yucatan comes to mind - where coconut oil is a staple, and those health issues simply don't show up there - so I would take those alarums with a grain of salt - but there is no shortage of information online or at your local library, and the concerned consumer can certainly educate himself on the subject without great effort.As an aside, I was recently told that there are individuals who write reviews of this sort for pay. I was disconcerted to think this might be true. You may take the opinions I express in these reviews or leave them, but of two things you may be certain, they are my own opinions and not for sale. Yes, Viva Labs did indeed send me a free jar of their coconut oil to try, and obviously their hope was that I would write a positive review, but the supplier also made it abundantly clear that I was under no obligation. I don't write trash reviews, and if I hadn't liked the product at all, I would have simply said nothing in print about it.  Fortunately that was not a problem in this instance, and I am happy to recommend this coconut oil, with reservations as expressed above.",5
"I cook, I really enjoy cooking.  I used to use butter for everything, then I had a heart attack and I started using Olive Oil, it was okay but I was never really satisfied with it as a replacement for generally frying pan cooking.  Than I was talked into using Coconut oil and I've been a fan of that since.  Some good ones, some bad ones.  Then I tried Viva Labs, it's so much easier to work with, and I don't feel like I'm using lard when I cook.  The vegetables come out like and flavorful, no burning smell when I cook hot (or maybe I'm getting better).  I'm much happier with this brand of Coconut Oil over others that I've used in the past.",5
"I use Viva coconut oil on my skin because I have very dry, rough skin. Coconut oil is the perfect emollient because it soaks in well and holds moisture in. I was offered a free jar of Viva's coconut oil, and am happy to offer my review. I'm impressed with the high quality of this coconut oil. It's organic and free of any chemicals that might irritate my skin. It has not been treated to remove the natural scent of coconut oil, like some other brands of coconut oil that I've purchased. It makes me smell like a Mounds bar! I use it at night before I go to bed, so I don't have to worry about the scent clashing with my perfume. I don't think I'd mind either way, because it smells so good. My skin feels very soft when I use it. I'll be glad to have this around this winter when my skin tends to dry out more. I'll buy this brand in the future.",5
"Ok, it may be partly hereditary, however, I use coconut oil very lightly on my face after showering. In the winter, I use it daily and I'm mid-forties and seriously people think I'm in my 20's/early 30's and when they ask what I use...coconut oil!I also use it as a conditioning mask for my hair about once a month. I was once blonde and my hair because really dry with all the dying/maintenance. One week, I decided to use coconut oil on my hair and put in on my dry hair, put a shower cap over it, slept all night with it (use an old pillow case so there isn't stain worries) and showered and shampooed the next day. HOLY WOW. So soft. My hair stylist now recommends coconut oil to her clients and also uses it.I love this Viva Labs organic because of the wide mouth jar. If you are using it for beauty use, it's so helpful to have a jar like this because when it gets to be toward the end of the product, you can still slip your hand in...whereas a small mouth jar, it's quite difficult (and I have small hands!).The second big thing about Viva - this coconut oil is certified NON-GMO. Meaning it hasn't been ""scientized"" for growth of profit for corporations at the possible expense to consumer health.I also fry my eggs in coconut oil (separate jars!)and found them just as tasty as fying in butter.LOVE LOVE LOVE this.",5
"Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has been all over our house.  My husband loves to make popcorn with it (tastes delish!)  I have used it when making sticky rice as well as on my elbows and feet (shhh!).  My toddler loves it on toast and just this morning I caught him with the jar open and a spoon in it!  I have barely had it a week and I am already going to need to order more.  I think two may be appropriate for the bathroom and kitchen, especially at this great price.  I am eager to try out baking and on my husband's unruly hair.  If anyone has any baking recipes they have used, please share in the comments.",5
"Coconut Oil - the name reminds me of a tropical island.  In this case, it is a product that can be used in the kitchen and the bath.  Upon opening the jar, there was a layer of liquid oil.  After mixing that into the rest of the contents, I got a substance that was like any body lotion you can buy.  I thought I would have to remix the contents every time I opened the jar but after the initial mixing, I didn't have to do that.I used it in the shower to hydrate my skin.  For me, only a small amount was needed to make my legs feel silky smooth.  It can also be used on your hair as a moisturizer but I have enough oil already so I didn't use it in that manner.The package says you can take the Coconut Oil as a dietary supplement but I also didn't use it in that manner.  I have my supplement regiment set and it works so I didn't want to change anything.Then I took the oil to the kitchen and used it in place of my olive oil for cooking.  It was just like using the olive oil but with a hint of coconut.  There was not an intense coconut flavor, just a very light taste that enhanced whatever I was cooking.One product --- many uses.  Not a bad deal for only having to have one jar instead of four.",5
"The fact that this versatile product can be used for cooking, baking, skin and hair care is a huge plus. My hair and skin are extra dry, so the coconut oil is wonderful for this. I imagine people with oily skin might not be able to use it, but that's for them to test and decide. When we visit New Mexico it is extremely difficult for me to keep my skin moisturized. This product works wonderful. I used it when frying some eggs and baking bread. It worked wonderful with no strange taste. The texture is wonderful and it goes a long way. The amount they give you is a great value for the money. Another huge plus as far as skin care is the wonderful tropical smell. Another plus is the fact it is organic. Myself and many other consumers are weary of products full of harmful chemicals or trans fats. I haven't tried the product as a supplement yet. Since I have an auto-immune disease I need to ask my physician first. I'd love to hear from people who do use it as a supplement and what their experience has been. I will definitely continue to use it on my skin and hair.",5
"Virgin Coconut Oil has so many uses from those used for eating and in cooking (there are great properties for VCO) and those for the body and skin.  This is a quality product, tastes very pure and possesess a light coconut fragrance.  It's a wonderful moisturizer and we love it.  Truth be told, several of my cats love virgin coconut oil and I share it with them.  Makes for a smooth coat.  I never take too much for myself (or for the cats) because of caloric value.Very nice quality oil.  Pleased.",5
"The first time I reviewed this I gave it just two stars. but I now give it 3 1/2 stars. i use it for a dry face. my skin feels smoother and more supple. but i did experience some tiny bumps (could be from anything). i wash my face with it twice a day. i rub it in, then i rinse it off (not completely) and gently towel dry. i don't leave it on my face. i found that leaving it on your face makes your face feel tight and dry. i try to exfoliate more while using the oil because the oil can clog your pores. once a week I use a face clothe to exfoliate my face with cetaphil cleanser. but i'm going to start doing it 2x a week. so, if you are experiencing dry face and every product you try breaks you out, then this might be worth a shot for you. it soothed my irritated face very much.",3
Good product but my son is allergic to peanuts and it lists May contain trace amounts of peanuts. Disappointing and scary.,3
"I was really excited to get my hands on this Coconut oil!  I have selectively used it in cooking and other recipes before, but have seen the increase in Coconut Oil usage over the last year.  I am extremely pleased with this product and am now cooking more and more with it!",5
"My niece just introduced me to coconut oil and she purchased a jar for me, which I didn't care for too much as for adding it to my salads, etc. the taste was too strong and it didn't do that much for my skin.  However, the makes of Viva Labs sent me a free jar for a review and I liked it much better.  it's taste isn't so strong and I can add it to my tea in the morning.  I am also using it on the skin of my arms, because the skin is so thin (from old age) that it needs to be continuously greased.  There again, the smell is not so overwhelming and now after reading the other reviews, I intend to try frying with it and using it on my hair.  I am glad I was sent this product for a trial.",5
"I have no complaint about the product itself.  It has a very nice coconut aroma, is silky smooth, and blends well with other oils.  However, my only caveat is that the jar, although packaged and sealed well, was at minimum ...25% EMPTY.  The jar is supposed to contain 15 fluid ounces.  It didn't appear to be so.  When compared to a comparable size jar filled with shea...which is much more dense...the amount of coconut oil I received was really short-changed.  Would certainly appreciate it if Viva Labs would re-assess their product to assure that the appropriate amounts are getting into their packaging.  Unfortunately, because of THIS experience...VIVA has lost a customer.",3
"I was approached Viva Labs saying that they had seen my numerous reviews on Amazon and they would like to have me test their product and review it.Let me start off by saying I know nothing about hair care really other then the average person. Wash it and keep it clean. I condition it, and I also like to style it straight (using a flat iron) or go curly using various styling products. But when it comes to the nitty gritty type of stuff, I dont really know much.So when I was offered a free product to try I figured why not? I love free stuff! Come on who doesnt? But, I knew nothing about this product, not until it arrived on my doorstep shortly thereafter.Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil comes in a plain tub. But the label stuck out to me: Great for Cooking and Baking, Skin and Hair Care Say what? You can use it on your skin and cook with it? WEIRD! Quite frankly, I was confused and had no idea what on earth I was supposed to do with this big tub (15oz) of Coconut Oil.The label reads:Suggested Use: As a supplement, take 1-4 tablespoons per day for best results. Can be added to your favorite foods to boost nutrition.My thoughts: After sticking my fingers into this weird but soft texture, Im not sure Id want to just go ahead and snack on the product. But after having opened it, awhile later the product turned very hard. Almost reminding me of frosting gone hard.The label continues:For Cooking: Excellent for cooking up to 350*. Can be used as a dairy-free alternative to butter in baking.For Skin Care: Use as a luxurious body moisturizer. Especially helpful for rough, cracked elbows and heels.For Hair Care: Use as a restorative, all-natural hair mask by massaging 1 tablespoon into dry hair. Let sit for 1-2 hours, shampooing thoroughly afterwards.Store in a cool, dry place with lid tightly sealed. No refrigeration necessary.Honestly, the thought of eating, or cooking with this stuff, just did not seem appealing to me. So I decided to use it for skin and hair care. The product isnt exactly solid, but it isnt in lotion form either. At least not after opening it. Upon the second use I had to microwave the container for a little bit until it melted and I was able to put it in my hair. I have hair down past my breasts, and so 1 tablespoon seemed way too little for me. Instead of measuring, I just stuck my hand in and grabbed a glob and tried to make sure every part of my hair was saturated in the product. Then, using a clip, I clipped it to the top of my head and let it sit for two hours.Washing it out was kind of a pain. Its oily, so you know how oil and water work together.they dont.  I ended up using a ton of shampoo, and shampooed at least twice, also then using a conditioner.Quite frankly, I cant say I noticed anything different about my hair. I tried using the product again a couple days later. And then once or twice after that, and still had no results I noticed. Then again, I dont know what it was supposed to exactly do for my hair to really pay attention to it.I also tried using the product as a lotion once, but felt it was too oily and didnt want it to ruining whatever clothing I was wearing at the time.So, for the ways that I used this product, I didnt find that it really did anything for me other then smell really good. Perhaps it works better for others.Since I didnt use it for all ways it could be used, and I wasnt sure exactly what it was supposed to do Im giving this a 3 star rating. It didnt hurt my hair, but didnt seem to improve it at all either.",3
"I was only interested in it as a moisturizer, so I won't speak to any other qualities.  It does a very good job of moisturizing, especially if you don't want a lot of artificial additives.  I keep waiting for it to turn rancid, but I'm into a month of use and it's still fresh smelling.",3
"For many reasons, I look for ways to add healthy fat to my diet. Coconut oil is one of the the good ones. I also try to shop for organic whenever possible. The Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has everything I would want in coconut oil: organic, good flavor, useful in cooking as a butter or oil substitute. It also works for a family member who is lactose intolerant and cannot use butter.However, I also try to buy my oil in glass and the Viva Labs product is packaged in plastic. So, although I recommend the product itself, I would not purchase this in the future. I will stick with the Organic Coconut oil that I usually use that is packaged in glass.",3
i can not remove product from container rock solid dried out i guess can was exposed to too much heat was  not  stored at room temperature,1
"I am sure works fine just not what expected.  I expected a liquid not solid form, am sure works fine if melted",3
"I've been adding this product to fruit and vegetable smoothies for the past month as a means of getting healthy fatty acids into my system and I've been favorably impressed.  Viva Labs coconut oil adds a hint of tropical flavor, while giving me an organic, non-GMO supplement.  I've also used it as a substitute for shortening in the kitchen and it works great.  I highly recommend this product.",5
"A good quality product that has its uses for skin and hair care as well as food.  Fragrant and mild-tasting.Ladies, here's an idea:  get your partner to give you a massage, using liberal amounts of this oil.  Then, invite your partner to lick off the excess.  Repeat as desired.  The procedure will benefit more than just your skin.(DISCLOSURE:  I was sent a free sample of the product to review, under no obligation).",5
"I am not on the coconut oil bandwagon.  I know about it, and have been encouraged to try it for multiple uses.  I've tried only one other coconut oil, which was highly refined and entirely flavorless.Viva Labs contacted me with a review for free sample request.  I received one jar of coconut oil at no cost.Not only am I not on the coconut oil bandwagon, I'm not on the gluten-free, fat-free, sugar-free, paleo, low carb, raw, vegan, vegetarian, or any other special diet.  But a lot of foods I like start with the letter ""C.""  Cruciferous vegetables, carrots, cucumbers, cherries, cranberries, candy, corn, candy corn, chocolate, cream, and COCONUT are some examples.This coconut oil has a luscious texture, and the fragrance and flavor of fresh coconut.  I won't use coconut oil in all my cooking, but it works well in my Hershey's Double Fudge Saucepan brownies (recipe is on the net), which calls for two tablespoons of butter.  The coconut oil substitutes perfectly for the butter and is a nice tweak to the recipe.  I will also try this with some shrimp, when I can get my hands on some fresh.  Coconut flavored shrimp, without the breading and deep fry?  Sounds good to me.I also need to get the shrimp before I finish dipping a spoon in it for a taste.  Not for medicinal purposes, mind you.  It just tastes absolutely fabulous, just a tiny bit.  A whole spoonful is gross, but I keep dipping.  Manna for my Midwestern, coconut-deprived tongue.  The flavor is delicious.",4
"This might be the best coconut oil ever! I am a coconut oil aficionado. I cook with it, put it in my smoothies, use it for baking, and as my skin and hair moisturizer. I've used many brands, Nutiva, Spectrum, Nature's Way, Now Foods, pretty much all of the raw unprocessed oils I could find. None of them were bad, and none of them blew me out of the water. Until now. This is by far my favorite. Why?THE AROMA - This really smells like coconut. When I opened the jar, it knocked my socks off. It smells divine! Like real, delicious coconutsTHE FLAVOR - You know with a powerful (yet not overpowering) aroma there has to be a delicious taste - and there is! you have to like coconuts to love this, and if you do you WILL love this.THE TEXTURE - Thick, creamy, wonderful texture. The only drawback to this is if you are using this on your skin it can seem a little overwhelming at first, but it does absorb really well.MULTIPLE USES - Cooking, baking, replacement for butter, smoothie ingredients, hair conditioner, body moisturizer.I you love coconuts, you will really be glad you tried this. This is now my brand and I won't bother with imitations.",5
"o say I was a little curious about this product is an understatement.  I was having a hard time accepting the fact that it could be used for so many of the different things they were claiming. Something I could use for my hair and skin care could also use for baking and cooking? Really? Okay, I ended up caving because I just had to know if it would be worth it and actually could be used for it all.SKIN CARE: I have serious dry skin. So serious that it looks like I have cold chills all the time. My skin is rough, dry and red especially on my arms and legs.  I have tried so many products for my dry skin only to be disappointed by the bottom of the bottle or jar.  I gave this product two weeks and my skin does feel softer. The redness has diminished a little bit, but not altogether.  It was a little greasy at first, but it wasn't so bad with the less you use. Less is more when it comes to the skin care with this product. I would give it a B for skin care.HAIR CARE: I used this once for my hair. I followed the directions but found I was not satisfied with it as a hair care product.  I am really particular about what I use on my hair. While it wasn't horrible for my hair, I won't use it again for that use just because of how picky I am. I would give it a C for hair care.(for personal preference)COOKING and BAKING: I tried using this for cooking and found it to be almost as good as using margarine or butter.  There was a slight difference in taste and use, but again it is all about personal preference. Everyone tastes things differently.  Easy to use as well. I gave it a B for cooking and baking.SUPPLEMENT: No rating as I did not use it as this.I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  While some uses were better than others, I think it boils down to personal preference in some areas and other areas it worked wonderfully.  The price is great considering you get a full jar of 15 fl. oz. to use.  It does go a long way so you get quite a bit of product for a long run trial.",3
"****NOTE: I was given a free product sample to try.****I gave it the old college try, but I'm not sure that the product is right for me.  I used it in the following applications:1) Cooking - I used it on my cast iron skillet to condition the iron.  It started to smoke, so I probably violated the ""less than 350 deg"" requirement.  Oops...2) Skin Care - slathered my feet in the oil, put on long socks, and slept with them overnight.  My feet were much softer in the morning - but not noticeably different then when I use vasoline or other products.3) Hair Care - Added a tablespoon to my hair, mixed it in well, and then covered my head with a nice warm towel for an hour.  My hair was certainly softer!  HOWEVER, it felt so greasy that one wash didn't get out the feeling.  Neither did two washes.  I ended up washing my hair a total of 4X that day and it still felt slightly greasy - and by that time any of the ""hydration, gloss and manageability"" was probably stripped out by the shampoo.  Not sure what happened there - maybe it isn't for people who already have somewhat greasy hair...?So I gave the product three stars as I think some of the problems were me, but I was really searching for things that I'd use the coconut oil for and I was coming up empty - I was not interested in cooking with it as I've found coconut oil to have an ""odd/oily"" taste.  Overall color me not really impressed.",3
"I feel a little bad giving this product only three stars after reading many of the glowing reviews.  I am also a consumer who received a free sample to try as a moisturizer for purposes of giving a written opinion.  I really didn't know anything about coconut oil for skin care.  I'm in my 70s, have lupus and Sjogren's syndrome, and my dermatologist prescribed a couple of  ""heavy duty"" moisturizing creams (not lotions) available OTC.  For years I have been satisfied with those products but am always willing to try something new.Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil arrived packaged in a large 15-ounce plastic jar or tub similar to the other moisturizing creams I use.  I read the label and found the suggested uses (cooking, dietary supplement) interesting.  I don't frequent health food stores or read books on nutrition, so I'm a real babe in the woods.After a shower I set about using my new moisturizing cream, and it was then I learned it's not a cream...it's a liquid. I had one of those Homer Simpson ""D'oh"" moments.  It's OIL!  I don't know what I was thinking.  It's yellow and has the consistency of melted butter.  I used it at that moment, but I had to be careful.  How to do it without making a mess?  I dipped four fingers into the oil, cupped my other hand and rubbed the oil on my legs.  I continued on my arms and chest.  My application method was a little messy and I had to put a paper towel under the jar to catch the run-off. There's a slight coconut fragrance. I immediately thought there must be a better way to package this oil for my use: I'd prefer a plastic squeeze bottle--the type that contains shampoo or hand soap.  Maybe a pump bottle. The jar just seems wrong--even for a nutritional supplement or for cooking.I decided to read some Amazon reviews and was enlightened.  This product has fabulous reviews. I had some surprises though.  Most reviewers were using this nutritionally, and many were regular users of coconut oil. I don't fit either category. In reading one review I got the impression that this product was white like coconut.  In others I learned that it's a solid product that is scooped out.  I wondered if I had a different product to review so I sent an email to Viva Labs Customer Service asking about the consistency of their Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  This is their quick reply: ""If it is warm or humid, the coconut oil may be liquid. In cooler climates and during the fall and winter months, the coconut oil will be more solid. It is very common for the coconut oil to switch from liquid to solid depending on the climate and season. This does not effect (sic) the health benefits of the product.""Ah Ha!  That explains it. I'm in Arizona.  It's October and our temperatures are still in the 90s.  I assume that because of the possibility of change to a more solid consistency, the coconut oil cannot be packaged in a squeeze bottle. So after all that narrative, here is my opinion.  The oil is applied easily. The light coconut fragrance is nice.  The day after the application, my skin is looking dry again (my skin is extremely dry). I will continue using the tried and true moisturizing creams the doctor ordered.  I do, however, plan to put this product in my refrigerator to change the consistency to something that works better for me.  I will try it in a few recipes that call for butter.  Maybe I'll be back for an update.I think it probably is a five-star product, just not in my particular case.",3
"Full disclosure, I was given a sample product to try. In the summer and warm days, it was a lovely body lotion given it went to a liquid state. Made me smell like a pina colada.BUT in winter, was hard as a rock. So put in closet till spring as was truly impossible to use as body lotion.I did not use as food, given I don't eat fats of this nature. So if you live in south, great body lotion. In the north, you might have to use it seasonally only.Does smell nice.",3
"My friends are all on this Coconut Oil kick, putting it in Green Tea, and it is delicious. However, it is to high in fat and saturated fat, I cannot find any valid reason to use it, not even for frying. If you are looking for a delicious coconut oil, this is it--but it's not for me.",1
"May work for others, but has not improved my skin condition at all.  I had to try, didn't cost much, but I have to find a product that works for me.",1
"I bought this to use in DIY cosmetics. It is very liquidy, and it shouldn't be. I have a jar of Nutiva coconut oul, and it stays solid at the same temperature that this one is a liquid. Now an entire batch of baby balm is ruined because it won't stay solid. I don't get it at all. Maybe it's not really pure coconut oil, because that is not how coconut oil is supposed to behave.",1
"I have no idea why this product is so popular, you literally smear your face with this stuff and you smell like a coconut the entire day while your skin has the weird greasy sheen to it. Plus it gets absolutely everywhere, your phone screen, you computer keys, everything you touch will have this stuff on it. It clogged the pores on my nose pretty bad, had to use those pore strips to clean it all out.",2
Extremely difficult to get out of container - should have tried another formulation.  Solid as a rock - just not what i expected,2
The truth is...it smelled okay when I opened the jar. I don't know much else about it but was prompted to make a review of it before being able to use much of it so I have no idea of it's quality other than it does not smell bad. I'd have given it a review after I used it normally but I guess now I cannot give it a good review. It looks the same as any other coconut oil I have bought.,3
"The product was sent to me to review on behalf of The Chocolate Cult.  An assistant helped me out and made a mousse with it but the results were definitely disappointing.The product is overwhelmingly coconut in flavor so unless you really like coconut, you won't like this.  Coconut oil should not taste like coconut when you use it for baking or cooking, it really shouldn't, that is one of the ""good"" things about it thus this flavor was unexpected and unwelcomed because it imbalanced everything.The product also lacks instructions in how to measure it as a substitute for butter or other oils so we had to do a lot of research to find out and either we were not correct or this is simply not a good product for baking or cooking.That is the big problem with this product -- it claims to be good for too many things and thus lacks information you need to use it well for in your kitchen.",2
"I purchased this item with the idea of addressing a flaky skin issue on one of my foster dogs.  I purchased it on the Amazon site, but it is not sold by Amazon.  As soon as I placed the order, the Spam and advertisement emails began to flood my inbox.  At first it was mainly for health-related products, but soon it spread to all kinds of crap.  I would never purchase another product from this company again, but once was enough; it will take a long time before my email account returns to getting only the very occasional amount of Spam that I was receiving before purchasing this item.  Buyer beware!",1
"I am surprised at one review that says it stayed liquid and slopped around when she poured it out for cooking since mine started out creamy, and now it is as hard as a rock, and I did put the top back on. I can't really use it for a night cream now because digging it out of the jar would break my nails.My husband is repelled by coconut, and he does the cooking, so I can't ask him to try frying anything with it. Although at this point, it would spoon out into a pan like lard, so the hardness is not a problem if you cook with it. I have used it on my skin and it temporarily softens and you smell like a macaroon cookie briefly.Haven't tried it on my hair yet, but now that it got hard, I don't know how I would get it on my head.Later: I subtracted a star because the company has orchestrated a team of posters to reply to all objections to this product as if they were satisfied customers, which is very unethical.",2
"Product of the PhilippinesAccording to the label, this product is manufactured and packaged in the Philippines not the USA. Consider other sources (Wal-Mart) where the product is produced in the USA and likely has more reliable quality control and sanitation standards.",1
Don't know what people are thinking putting this on your skin it comes like a brick u have to scrape and then melt with your hands sounds fun.Didn't use to cook with but guess I'll try it can't be worse does smell good.,1
"We don't write reviews too often, and when we o, we mostly choose to write them when something is particularly great.However, now and then, something is bad enough to make time to express that towards other buyers as well, and as much as I hate to say it, with our last purchase, that's the case... :(Unfortunately we have to side with many other costumers who rated the new & improved version very low - we are incredibly disappointed.I myself was a 'pampers baby', and our son has been since he was 6 months old... he is now 22 months and we used a size 4... and we loved the brand. Devoted buyers we were, as it was the only diaper our son wouldn't leak thru regularly, especially overnight.We live in the desert, and we drink a lot of fluids.. hence, they fill up quickly, and we go thru a lot of them...What's changed, that disappointed us? For one, there are there over a dozen less per box now.  Not a huge deal, but it all adds up in the end.The big deal: they are way less effective than they were before the 'improvements' took place.I am honestly very surprised to see this happen from this brand. We now also have issues with the tape (never had that before), we have leaks regularly (also rarely ever occurred previously, as we change quite often due to sensitive skin and mentioned amount of fluids we drink), just like when we tried the store brand diapers...The 'feel' of them also appears more 'plastic-y' compared to the nice soft feel before... I'm sorry to say our experience is the exact opposite of all that was communicated via ads to have been improved.Everything that justified spending more on this brand of diapers seems to have disappeared now - were very disappointed and will now go 'trial diaper shopping'  again. :(",1
"I am noticing everywhere that Pampers and Luvs are downsizing all of their boxes. Some of them are BIG downsizes too. For example, I just bought a box of Pampers Cruisers because they were on sale, and I got the last old box of of size 4, 148 count. The rest available at the store were all the new size 4, 136 count for $40.  Really? That is absolutely ridiculous.  This Baby Dry box of size 4 used to be available in 192 count, (which is still available on Amazon but not for subscribe & save) and is now only available in 180 count. Why, Pampers?  The same goes for every line of diapers that Pampers makes. I WAS a loyal Pampers fan in the beginning, with my son because I loved the ultra soft Swaddlers but not anymore. I can understand if the company was spending more on the product, and making a higher quality one, but from what I can tell, these diapers are the same quality as the old ones for MORE money. After comparing these and Huggies Snug & Dry; Huggies is a better quality diaper AND they offer a larger quantity at this size, so I'm a convert. I REFUSE, I mean absolutely REFUSE to pay the same amount for LESS diapers.",1
"I picked up the Baby Dry diapers to try out at the store, and was so happy with them, I signed up for them on Subscribe and Save. My baby freaks out over the slightest dampness, it was a huge relief to be able to go hours between changes. I get my subscribe and save order in, and It's like using regular diapers again, right back to frequent changings. I noticed the design was different from the first ones, so I come on here and look for more info just to see all these reviews saying the same thing. Pampers, get your act together. Amazon, sorry, but now I'm buying them from local store that haven't sold through the previous version. I'm bummed because the main point of signing up for Amazon Mom and paying $80 a year was getting the 20% discount on diapers, now it feels like I wasted my money.",1
"Dear Pampers PR: If there's more material in your ""upgraded"" diapers, which is why you reduced the number in the box, why is the listed weight for the size 6 box now 10.3 pounds (for 128), while the weight on the previous size 6 box was 11.7 pounds (for 140)? (Thank you google cache of amazon's web listing!) That's a big downgrade -- each diaper (now with _more_ absorbing material) now weighs _less_ than before! Thank you, the maths! (Looking forward to the spin on that!)Also, please, in a little bubble under this review, please tell me that while I'm upset that you (and Amazon after it bought Diapers.com, eliminating the competition for affordable diapers) are essentially raising prices, that you'll pass along my comments to ""the team."" And that you sincerely hope I'll continue to, blah, blah, blah. I will then take your answer, print it, crumple it, and wrap it in a pamper. Now that they're even more absorbent, it may even hold your response without any leakage. So go ahead and add 20% more ""content"" to your response than you've written to the other upset former customers!",1
"I have used baby dry with my first one, who is now 5 and am currently using it for my nine month old. I have been racking my brain to think hard as to what has changed that is causing my son to get such bad rashes. I have had my suspicion that it could be the diaper and now that I am reading so many reviews, I am absolutely convinced that it is this new changed diaper. My situation is so bad that I had to visit the doctor yesterday and this all started when I opened this new pack 4-5 days ago. I think it is time for me to move on to another brand like huggies.",1
"We had no problems with these diapers, they were great, now since the new design, LEAKS after LEAKS and LEAKS!!! I think there is a serious quality issue.  WHATEVER you did, please change them back, we are now looking at other diapers (I hate to say it, maybe even huggies) due to the changes.  Please, please, pampers-bring back the previous diapers that were so great or you will be losing a once loyal customer.",2
"I hate these changes!  I can understand the raise in price/ lowered number in the box with the economy, we're all taking the hit and while we don't like it...back to the product.  The images, get over trying to make the cutest diaper ever, there are so many pictures that they show through light colored clothing, but the issue is when I grab a diaper quickly to change my toddler, I can't easily tell which is the front or back anymore.  I'm on baby number six and have been a loyal pampers user due to sensitive skin issues, I know how to change a diaper, but with my new box of ""improved"" diapers I've probably attempted to put the diaper on backwards at least half a dozen times.  Ridiculous I know, but are we paying extra for the stupid pictures?Now for the real issues - the leg elastic seems to disintegrate the moment my toddler moves even when his diaper is dry, and the stretchy material attaching the tapes to the diaper shred when I'm putting the diaper on.  I have wasted so many diapers due to these new and improved materials that the cost has nearly doubled for me.  Also, my laundry has multiplied as the gaping leg holes don't keep him dry anymore, luckily his clothes are absorbant.I've been willing to pay for the premium diapers, but seriously, these are junk and unfortunately I have several cases of these garbage diapers - please bring back the old ones!",3
"This is a new listing for what is essentially the old pampers baby dry diapers just with less diapers in the package. The manufacturer claims to have raised the amount of absorbent material in the diaper by 20% but I can not see any improvement in the diapers, perhaps that is because I never had a problem with the level of absorbency in the baby dry diaper before so an increase in absorbent material does nothing to improve the product. What this does do is allow give the company a reason behind their reduction in the number of diapers in the package while charging the same amount.So what the consumer is left with is a diaper which still does an adequate job of absorbing moisture but now we have less of them for the same price. Our family has always used Pampers diapers since day 1 (our baby's but has never known another brand), unfortunately after this change we will no longer be able to say this since we will be auditioning other brands. I can not say at this time that we will swap brand but pampers has our confidence and given us reason to try to find a suitable replacement.",1
"I've used Pampers since my daughter was born. They fit her the best, but after this recent downgrade I'll be looking into other brands. You claim that there is ""more absorbency""  but honestly, my daughter has woken up in the middle of the night with more leakages than EVER before. I certainly do not think that these ""new"" diapers are better in absorbency. I, in fact think that they are worse. I was going to stick it out, because I thought that with less diapers the price would go down, but I refuse to pay the same price for diapers that are less in number and worse in absorbency.",1
"My box of 222 now down to 204 because they are 20% more absorbent????  First, I see NO difference in performance.  Secondly, just because they are ""more absorbent"" doesn't mean I'm going to let my baby sit in a wet diaper longer!  I still go through the same number of diapers and now have to buy more.  If I ran out before my next S&S; order, I would just buy a package in the store - I'm NOT paying $45 for a one time, buy now box. Pampers have always been my go-to with Amazon S&S; however my next in line is Seventh Generation and I'm thinking they'll be my go-to diaper.  Our house has been using Pampers for over 3 years.  So disappointed.",2
"i'm going to base my review on the actual diaper not how many come in box. i've tried basically every diaper out there and so far these have been my favorite. The swaddler ones wouldnt last very long and her clothes would feel damp after a nap in them. These diapers can last a lot longer. the exterior of the diaper might not be soft like a swaddler, but my daughter seems content in them and they are working great!",5
"I don't buy for a moment the sorry excuses of Pamper PR executives about adding more absorbent material. This in effect means that you believe a dirty diaper should be worn longer because now it's more absorbent. The truth is that your diapers were fine before and this is just a piggish move to silently increase your profits. Probably some genius middle level executive showed a chart where forcing parents to buy again sooner will make more money.Well you lost me and I know of countless other parents (I've been very active in my various mommy groups that host thousands of mommies as well as twitter and FB). Maybe you saved 7%, or you think parents will buy more often but I know that you lost a whole lot of customers who are now discovering other brands. As I did!",1
I had signed up for 192 count  amazon subscribe program and amazon changed to 180 count size 4 diaper without me initiating it. This is not I would expect from a customer oriented company like amazon.,1
"I've tried several brands of diapers and these work as well as any I've ever used. We're part-time cloth diapers users and part time disposable. We've never had a leak in these with our twelve-month-old during the day time or night. I do feel good about using cloth when I can, but these offer everything I look for in a disposable: they work, and they seem just as comfy as anything else I put on him as far as I can tell.In the past, Pampers didn't seem to work the best for either of my boys when they were young babies. Right now these are doing great. I don't know if it's because they happen to fit better, or because messes from younger (breastfed) babies actually cause more challenging messes for diapers. But zero complaints now that I have a 19 lb baby in size 3. For what it's worth, they also got his older 28-lb brother through the night, though he's typically in a 4.I'm not taking price into account for this review. So is it possible you'd find a diaper that works just as well for a better price? Quite possibly. Definitely do the math. But for performance, I'm going to give these full marks.",5
After 4 years this was the straw that broke the camels back. I have moved to Huggies and just ordered by first box! Bye bye Pampers - i hope your 'rip off' tactics boost your sales - but not from me they won't! I will not be back. Please tell your VP of Marketing he/she has messed up - resign resign resign!,1
"I, like many others, am very disappointed to see this! I don't care that you've had to put less in a box because the absorbency/materials changed blah blah, etc... that's fine...but the PRICE should also reflect that there are less diapers...it shouldn't be the SAME price for less diapers! We've used Pampers since my son was born (we've tried other brands but kept coming back to Pampers), and we've saved money using Amazon and Subscribe & Save...HOWEVER, going forward I will buy another brand of diapers if it's less money per diaper. Recently money has been tight and I was able to justify the slightly higher price for Pampers...until this happened. Pampers, your PR people can try to spin this any way they want, but the bottom line is you tried to be sneaky by putting less diapers in the box but NOT changing the name (Economy Pack Plus). Sorry, but it's no longer ""economy"" for me.",1
"I have been using these diapers for several months now. We use Pampers exclusively and haven't had any problems with leaks, diaper rash or the diapers falling apart. I go through 40+ diapers in a given week and these have stood up to the test during the days and nights. Highly recommend!",5
"Here's what I wrote in the ""Reason for Return"" box under the ""defective"" heading:Not adequately absorbent. Product advertised as 12-hour/overnight diapers. Experienced leaks 3 nights in a row. Product does not work as advertised.These are truly disappointing. For new parents, choosing diapers is really hard because there are so many choices. We thought that because Pampers Swaddlers were so good, the Pampers Baby Dry would be even better. Wrong. It's the other way around. Swaddlers are thicker, more absorbent, and result in far fewer overflows. Read the reviews and compare photos! Never, ever waste your money on this useless waste. Get Swaddlers if you aren't completely put off by the fact that this company sells this product.A more honest tag line for this product: ""Pampers baby dry. Thinner previous generation diapers that probably work great for babies who don't pee a lot but that we continue to sell because we know that selecting diapers is a confusing PITA for new parents and so they'll probably accidentally buy them and might not have anything better to compare them to.""",1
"PROS1. Compared to Costco diapers, these feel subjectively thinner and easier to put on to my newborn.  I'm more sure of the fit because it is not as fluffy feeling as other diapers and I can tell where the diaper legging and waist areas are and how much tension is against the skin easier.2. The closure straps are significantly easier, faster to apply and remove.  The Costco diapers have their flaps folded twice which at night time makes for an extra second to find and sometimes untwirl the straps before being able to unpeel them.  Then once the Costco straps are on, they apply so tightly up to the very edge, that in the dark using only our sense of touch, it can be hard to find the strap edges to unpeel them.  These Pampers have the adhering portion end about 2-3 mm short of the edge so that there is an edge that can can be felt and grabbed to removed.  The edge also has a saw tooth cut pattern so your fingertips can feel that difference against the rest of the diaper at night.3. There is a nice texture that prevents the diaper from sliding around much during placement if the new diaper.  Sometimes with other diapers, after I place the new diaper under the baby, then grab the front portion to pull up, the diaper slides up and too far to the front easily because the diaper is very slippery.  This pampers diaper has a texture that gives more grip to the baby during changes.4. No leaksCONS1. No color change indicator for urine which is found on competitor diapersCONCLUSIONI'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews but there are a lot of variables involved in a diaper fit, like buying pants for an adult.  All babies are different in body type and parents have slightly different techniques which might make som designs better suited.  This diaper is the best I've used for now my 3rd child and I previously did no care too much about diaper brands.",5
I got what is expected. I love not having to buy diapers in store these come delivered to my door! With free shipping I just have to plan accordingly. The diapers are all packaged as should be and box was in great shape.,5
"Ok, so I am not a big reviewer but these new product changes warrant a warning. First off, my son is now almost 15 months old and we have been pampers users since day 1 with the preemie snugglers. I never felt the need to try another brand as the pampers always were soft, didn't leak and were a good value comparatively. I have been happy with this brand until my last order which upon arrival, had  several noticeable differences. Quantity- there were about 20 less for the same price. Quality- these were obviously thinner and less soft. Appearance- really I normally wouldn't care but the top/band of each one is blue, just like the ones I use for night time so I keep mixing them up which is just annoying. Even bigger bummer is that I'm now almost 8 months pregnant and the one thing I was sure of this time was that I had the diaper thing all figured out. In general I'm just annoyed and ordered my first box of huggies. We'll see how it goes......",3
"I had to post because I truly believe these new diapers is the problem.  We have been using Baby Dry diapers forever.  Our now 3 1/2 year old used them all the time.  Then with our new one, we continued it.  No issues.  Ever since the 'new/changed' diapers, our daughter has been having these 'burn like' rashes.  Looks like chemical burns which are red, spotty, and very bumpy.  I realized the only thing that have changed were these diapers.  I'm going to go out and buy a set of Kirkland diapers to see if it resolves the issue but it should be the problem since others are complaining of the same issue.We haven't changed anything else such as bath soap, lotions, creams, wipes.  I'll post again after I test out another diaper.  I have a full unopened box at home which I don't wan to open and I'm about to cancel my Amazon subscription.",2
These diapers caused my daughter to develop a severe rash that more closely resembled a chemical burn than any diaper rash I have ever seen.  The rash went away when we discontinued using these diapers.  Up until this point we had luck with Pampers size 1 and 2 but have switched to another brand since this issue.,1
"I loved pampers. We have exclusively used pampers on both our boys and want more kids. The ""newer version"" has caused a terrible rash. Our son itches and is red all over and has had bumps... it's awful. If your child has sensitive skin, as ours does, be careful. We are switching to huggies.",1
"I wrote this review on the old formulated diaper but since we've been through a box or two of the new ones I felt compelled to post it here on the new reformulated product since this review is truly about the NEW version of these diapers and not the old.I will update this more if we try them again. Anyone interested in how the diapers went from Good to Bad should definitely read this entire thing to see how things turned sour.Newly Formulated Diapers that are Bad!:Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus 180 CountOld Formula Diapers that used to be GREAT!:Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus 192 Count----------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW #1: (9-10-13)There seems to have been a redesign of some sort to the Baby Dry diapers in the past month+. Since my last order (Received August 9th, but started using them later in August) there is a new design and the colors and characters changed slightly.  Guess they changed something else in the construction of the diaper as well since my child has never blown out of the baby dry diapers, but in this new batch/redesign alone feels wet as if the liquid is passing right through the diaper. This never happened before, and we still have a few of the older ones in a bag my wife brings around and they do not blow out like these ones. 4 wet feeling diapers in less than 2 weeks, and never felt that before in all the time we've been using them.I also noticed that Amazon now has a message stating ""There is a newer version of this item"". Guess the box design has been changed, and the quantity of size 4's is only 180 now instead of the 192. I sure hope Pampers didn't pull a fast one and lower the quality, quantity, and leave the price the same.Child #2 is on the way and I am a die hard Pampers fan, but if these diapers continue to blow out I will be looking at one of the other main available brands. I don't care to bargain shop store brand diapers, and I mostly buy my Pampers exclusively on Amazon, so I will consider other brands Amazon carries.I used to consider these diapers a 5 star product, but I have them at a 4 star for now until I see how they prove to be over the next few weeks.I have another case showing up this week and if this second case does the same as the August batch, I will be saying bye to Pampers and spreading the word.----------------------------Updated Review #2: (9-27-13)Looks like I am in the same boat as many others starting to post on the newly formulated diapers. Not only did the quantity drop and the price stay the same, the last 2 boxes (Still 192 count but the design changed) gave my daughter a horrible rash on her bottom side. So to the manufacturer (Pampers), that extra 20% absorbency must be inferior, or have a different chemical compound.I have been an exclusive ""Pampers Only"" diaper user and have swayed many people to your brand, but I can't anymore. We are trying Huggies and are waiting to see if her rash clears up.They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and coming from a parent and seeing a rash on my little one, a thousand words I would share wouldn't be very nice. Not posting a pic of my baby's bottom, but its the worst spotty rash she has ever had and doesn't seem to be clearing up.I think I will be getting in touch with Pampers and demanding a refund on the last 2 boxes we ordered. Amazon isn't to blame, Pampers is. Pampers/Manufacturer, can I also call the number you shared above to request a refund for the last 2 purchases which caused the rash? Please share who I can call.I don't think Pampers is a bad company, and we've LOVED their diapers (Swaddlers, Cruisers, Baby Dry, Etc), but something changed for the worse recently. Maybe it has something to do with how an individual baby's body reacts to the chemicals inside, I don't know, but they have been fine for 18 months until we used the last 2 boxes after the diaper changed. I may eventually try them again if we don't end up loving the Huggies, but I will definitely be buying a very small package so if it happens again I will never use Pampers diapers ever again or recommend them.Baby #2 is on its way and I thought I was a Pampers use for life, but i'm unsure anymore. We did love the swaddlers though.----------------------------Updated Review #3 (11-6-13):Well, I first thought going from 192 per box to 180 for the same price was a problem but little did I know the new formula would bring a much bigger problem.  The new diapers cause a horrible red rash.After a box or so of Huggies, the rash had gone away my wife and I decided to ""try"" to use up the rest of the Pampers we had on hand even though we were worried the rash might return. I sort of felt obligated to try them again in case the rash was a fluke or was caused by something else and the Pampers were being blamed. I also think time passes and you forget how bad something is, and I felt bad wasting the diapers we had or giving them to someone and risking them doing the same to someone else's child so we tried them again.  Well, after 2 to 3 days of using the Pampers again, my daughter's butt was as red as a cherry and looked bad again! Not as bad as the last time since she actually got a few sores in the past, but her butt was so red we knew right then and there it was the Pampers. Switched back to Huggies and within 1 day the red subsided.Now that we have been through a box or two of Huggies I can confidently say that the rash is gone and my daughter hasn't had much of a rash at all.  The pro's of Huggies are that they do not cause a rash, and they seem to be slightly cheaper on a per-diaper basis. The downsides of huggies are that they don't hide odors as well as the pampers. If my daughter has a pee diaper I usually can tell before I even feel it since I can smell it. With the pampers I never remember smelling it at all. I would much rather smell the pee and know I have to change it versus the Pampers masking the smell and giving a rash.Unfortunately that tells me the Pampers are definitely the problem and we will NOT be using them again. Maybe I will forget how bad they really are and try to use up the rest in the future and see if it does the same, but so far Pampers are 2 for 2 and is unacceptable!I still want to like Pampers and I thought I was going to be a customer for life (As long as my babies are in diapers), but these newly formulated diapers have let us down more than once now. Baby #2 is on its way and we may try the Pampers Swaddlers since we absolutely loved those with baby #1, but I am definitely hesitant.I sure hope Pampers is passing all this bad feedback along to their development team, and not just to their reputation management team to try to band-aid the issue, and instead actually make a change to the product that was superior and has now turned bad.",2
Just wanted to also voice my discontent for the price increase and quantity decrease.  Both my kids were pampers wearers from birth.  We justified spending the extra dollars since Pampers seemed to be a good quality diaper that didn't leak.  I just don't think the expensive to begin with fine product needed an improvement that required a cost increase.  I will likely shop around for a new brand.,2
"My 2 1/2 year old has been in Pampers since the day he was born, and I've been buying them every month, month after month.  Quite an amount of business to Procter and Gamble, and I was planning to continue to give you the business for the rest of my child's diaper life and for my upcoming child as well because we've been so happy with the quality as well as Amazon's price, and frankly impeccable logistics and customer service.But this move to reduce the number of diapers and then for Pampers to rationalize it by saying they're now 20% more absorbent is simply so disappointing, it's driving me to write a negative review when it's seldom that I do so.  Especially because this is truly a ""household staple"" as opposed to more of a niche product that's purchased a couple of times a year.I expect to ride out the use of Pampers for my son, however for my soon-to-be-born daughter I expect to move off of Pampers and go to Kirkland Signature (Costco) because the quality is similar but the price difference per diaper is now much more pronounced.",1
"When these diapers get little wet,  the material loses its strength and bottom starts hanging.fits well.wouldn't recommend though.",3
"We had always heard good things about Pampers, so when it came time to stock up on diapers before our baby was born, we chose mostly Pampers. Thinking the Baby Dry would be a good option, we particularly purchased these. Unfortunately now the nights our son has slept through the night, he wakes up soaking wet. He is definitely not getting 12 hours of protection but instead less than 8, and now not only do I have to change his diaper but also all of his clothes.  I wish we had not purchased as many of them and will probably consider exchanging them for another brand.",1
"I've read all the reviews about the packaging being smaller and Pampers replying it's ""because they are now 20% more absorbent."" I just started using Pampers on my twins about 3 months ago, so I started purchasing them again (used them with my now 4.5 year old) just after the ""new and improved"" Pampers baby dry came out. In response to Pampers comments on all these reviews about the diapers being more absorbent, you are full of it! They work exactly the same, if not even a little bit worse than when my daughter used them 4 years ago! The only reason I will continue to buy these, is because my twins have sensitive skin and these are the only diapers, so far, that don't cause their bums to breakout in an eczema rash. Also, why are we promoting parents leave their babies in diapers for 12 hours. How would you like sitting in a wet diaper for that long???",2
"I love Pampers. I've cycled through quite a few brands, LUVS and Target being my least favorite because they feel scratchy and leak. Pampers has always been a great all around diaper that's soft, locks everything in, thin, and has high backs that keep poop in, and high fronts to fold over to keep pee (for boys) from leaking out. This Pampers has complete absorbance inside the diaper. Some diapers only have an absorbing pad centered in the diaper to save on cost, but Pampers has it all the way through (like a pad that covers the interior diaper).My only complaint with this set, is for a Size 1 diaper, I think it should include a visible line when the diaper is wet. I think at that age you really need it, because when they're so little it's difficult to tell when/if they peed, and you may want to keep track of that.",4
"A good diaper should hold in wetness and ""other stuff"", should be adjustable without tearing, and should be nonirritating to the baby. I received these and the Pampers Swaddlers for the purpose of reviewing these.  I typically buy Huggies Snug and Dry. I found little difference between this diaper, the Swaddler, or Huggies except that the Swaddlers cost a lot more and had a moisture detection dye.  All diapers do a reasonable job of holding in wetness and ""other stuff"" although the Baby Dry did seem to do a marginally better job.  None of the diapers tore during use and my son did not develop irritation during use.  I should note that my son does not seem to have a problem with irritation with any diaper except for Luvs (those turned his bum acid red). These diapers were less bulky than Huggies.  These do have a slight scent which I personally think is unnecessary, a poopy diaper is still stinky. Adding a scent does not make the diaper any less nasty smelling and its just an unneeded chemical that can cause irritation to a baby with sensitive skin. I deducted a star for the scent.  I would buy either these or Huggies, depending on which had a better price.  If both were priced about the same, I would go with the Huggies because they do not have a scent.",4
I have been using Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive for the past 1.6 yrs for my daughter and switched to this recently. this was a very good product.,5
"I've used Huggies Snug and Dry pretty exclusively over the past two years, but recently acquired these and thought I'd compare and contrast.Tabs - these tabs are smaller than the Huggies tabs, but that does not seem to affect how they fit.  I never had a problem with a tab coming unsecured.  (I've never had that problem with Huggies either).Bulk - these are less bulky than Huggies, which I like.  It seems to me that it would make baby more comfortable not to have a huge wad of material between his legs.Smell - these diapers have an odor to them that Huggies don't.  It's that artifivial ""baby"" smell that you find in lots of baby products.  I dislike it.  Generally, I do not want an odor covering up the smell of my child's diaper, as odor is the way I tell if it's dirty most of the time.  So, on that, these come out behind Huggies.Overnight - I used these overnight and didn't have any leaks.  I've never had a problem with leaks, though, including with the Huggies brand.So whether you prefer these will be a persona preference.  I like the less bulk, not the artificial smell.  The way it nets out is that there's no real reason for me to switch brands, so I'll remain a Huggies mom.  :-)",4
"I'm really not seeing a lot of difference between these Pamper Baby Dry's, and the previous iteration.  Fewer per box (I'll address that below).  Pampers is simply the best out there.  Superior fit, elastics, fasteners, absorbency, softness.  The only better diaper to my knowledge is Pampers Swaddlers.  The Swaddlers seem a bit softer, although these Baby Dry's are still soft, and by no means what we would call plastic-y, as one reviewer maintains.Price:  I'm a grandparent and received this box via the Vine program.  However, my daughter (the babies' Mom) is a regular purchaser via Amazon Prime, so I feel qualified to comment on price.  So there is a lower diaper count in this new Baby Dry package.  Pampers spokespeople maintain that this is because of the added absorbency element.  I'll accept that as a truthful, reasonable explanation. I'll also accept that at some point Pampers will no doubt have to eventually raise their price - just like the price of taxes, postage stamps, health care, coffee, and so on.  I don't like it, but I do appreciate that Pampers continues to produce a superior product at what is still a reasonable price.  I hope this family is out of the diaper years by then.Pick your own diaper price range.  As for ultimate product quality, these diapers are exceeded only by Pampers own Swaddlers line.  No choice but 5 stars.",5
This new design is hurting my kid & does not fit good. I feel the older one was much better & cheaper. I never tried other diapers & now I may have to switch to other brands.,1
"I like these Pampers for my newly born nephew because I have found these to be very absorbent although I don't allow my baby to stay in a diaper for 12 hours as advertised. They fit very well and the soft elastic bands move well with baby! They are soft to the touch to protect baby's skin!  I love that Pampers offer the same diapers up to stage 4.I got 252 disposable diapers for about $40. I recommend Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Size 1 Economy Pack Plus 252 Count for any new born and even though many reviewers ranked this low, I didn't have the same problems.",4
"Overall we have been a Pampers family and very satisfied with the products. Unfortunately, this product just didn't work for us. Leakage was an issue (albeit a minor one) but really I didn't feel like the baby dry was as good as the swaddlers for us. We decided to stay with the swaddlers instead of moving over to this product.",3
"I've read a lot of the criticisms and they have merit. I'm sure the bean counters at Procter & Gamble are doing everything they can to squeeze every dime out of us parents. I feel your pain fellow parents. And I'm a relatively new Dad, so I can't comment on how these diapers used to be back in 2005 or 2006.The diaper itself feels light. Much lighter than Walgreens. (P.S. - Dear Pampers: Walgreens would put a dent in your business if amazon sold them.) The tabs close very well. I haven't a problem with a tab coming off.Each diaper has a Sesame Street character on it. A couple on the front and a couple on the back. My kids love that. So that's a small bonus.Leaks. OK - here's why I'm shelling out the money for Pampers. P&G; owns Luvs. They were cranking out Luvs for 17 or 18 cents a diaper at my local Wegmans. I could see what was going on. The economy is in the tank and P&G; owns a ""value"" brand that works well. Forgive me for seeming paranoid, but just around the August 2013 Pamper ""redesign"" (note: any brand redesign is always a ploy to screw the customer, is it not? New Coke anyone?) there was a major change to Luvs. Suddenly my boys are waking up soaked in pee every night with their Luvs.Lo and behold...the price of Luvs skyrocketed while the cost of Pampers appears to me to have declined slightly. What a coincidence!P&G;, you evil geniuses...you figured out how to squeeze out your value brand and bring everybody back to the premium brand. Well done. Very well done.So yes, the corporate cynicism is annoying...but, on amazon I'll put this diaper above all others. Note to P&G; folks who read this: if what I'm saying is true...and perhaps it's just paranoia...your MBA bean-counters forgot one thing: what is the value of an intangible, in this case, loyalty? By engaging in behavior that insults your customers, you destroy brand loyalty. So...when Walgreens Well Beginnings are convenient...I'll stock up. Note to reader: I can get to a Walgreens...but it's just so much easier with my work schedule to order diapers from amazon. But if it's easy for you, go to Walgreens and check out those diapers. They are solid as a rock. They probably weigh twice what the pampers weigh. And I rarely had a leak with them.",5
"This set of diapers suck. The baby dry diapers used to be well built earlier. But for the past 2 purchases, the material has become flimsy. They always lead to explosions and leaks all the time. I had to switch to swaddlers. Boo pampers, improve your sourcing and manufacturing. Stop Chinese manufacturing. I wish i could get refund for my two purchases that I did in August and Sept",1
I forget how much I love pampers until I am out and pick up luvs or target brand diapers.  They don't feel as good and they smell terrible compared to pampers.  Even when my baby is wet- it's not a terrible odor when I use pampers but I can't stand the smell with cheaper brands.  I am a part of amazon mom and order these with subscribe and save- they are way cheaper here than anywhere else (even sams club/costco) and I am glad I can keep getting 20% off these diapers with that program.  I have big babies and have never had a leak with these- even after going all night.,5
This is by far the best value on Pampers or for that matter any brand diapers.  Having them delivered right on time is an added bonus.,5
"Pampers is getting expensive day by day. Their baby dry diapers are proving to be leaky. I have done all the research to prevent leaks and taken precautions before concluding that it is the diapers which are NOT holding for by 20 lb 1.5 yr old girl. And, with that I switched to size 5, even though she is only 20lb and they seem to hold pretty good. Now pampers decided to increase the price on each diaper of size 5 (by reducing the count per package). Not only do I have to pay more for bigger size diapers, but I also have to pay more in general. Not happy at all. Trying Huggies this time, which is only 23 cents per diaper for the overnight protection ones and I can use size 4 till she is 37lbs. If that works, I am bidding adieu to Pampers.",2
Great service and price never have to worry about keeping supplies up. They are delivered like clockwork and very easy to make changes as children move from size to size,5
"We never had a problem with the old design, no leaks to report in 1+ years of use.  With this new design every single one has leaked (tried many just to make sure it wasn't a fluke).  What a shame to ruin a good thing Pampers, very frustrating.  We have cancelled our subscribe and save, returned two boxes, and are shopping for a new diaper.  If Pampers is smart they would admit their mistake and re-instate the prior design before they alienate their customer base (which has already started).  We are only on baby 1 so far and planned to use Pampers on all our kids, even used to recommend them to others.  No more....",1
I have used Pampers since my son was born always preferred them. Best diapers when it comes to sleeping through the night with them.,5
"As we all know, diapers and babies are very individual. What works for one, doesn't work for another. I started out using Pampers swaddlers, and loved them. I tried Huggies Naturals and they leaked horribly. My daughter isn't a huge pee-er and those diapers would leak out the top in the front constantly. Luvs gave her a horrible rash on her tummy and back from the first time I used one. So I went back to the Pampers. I decided to try the baby dry since I hate to change her diaper in the night and wake her up. So far so good. Haven't had any leaks, no diaper rash, and seems to keep her skin pretty dry even after 12 plus hours over night. The diapers are thin, but that doesn't effect their function. They hold ALOT of liquid. I actually like the thinness. Makes her pants less bulky and easier to snap a onsie on. I'm a Pampers girl from now on. So far the best diapers I've tried. They may cost a bit more, but with diapers, I'm finding out you get what you pay for. There's nothing I don't like about these.",5
"I've purchased Pampers diapers for the past 11 years and have never had this problem, however, the seam on these Size 5 Baby Dry diapers keeps popping open under my daughter's right leg, letting the absorbent ""jelly-like"" material gush out all over the place. I do not have this problem with the Size 6 Baby Dry Diapers or the Size 4 Baby Dry diapers in the most recent re-design which makes me think this might just be a problem with the batch that I have. Pampers sent me coupons to compensate for my expense, so maybe I'll try again and hope for a different batch. For those of you who order and have a similar problem, make sure you contact Pampers' customer service so that they can resolve the problem. I didn't have to wait on the line to talk with a rep. and the gal I spoke with was very friendly! ;)",2
"We were happily using the ""old"" version of baby dry but since it was updated to the ""new and improved"" version, my baby started leaking at night. I think the ""update"" is just a lame excuse to increase the price. I don't mind the price increase as long as the quality actually improved. Major ripoff by Pampers. I'm looking for diaper alternatives now....",1
"Dear PampersI've been very disappointed with this product. Can't notice any big upgrade except that it seems to weigh a bit lighter than before. My family was a huge fan of the old version of Pampers baby dry. So devout that we even purchased Pampers baby dry while living abroad though it incurred extra money spent for the imported products.If the quality of this new upgrade remained the same or higher, I wouldn't complain about the reduced number of diapers (128 ct.). However, this new baby dry doesn't do its job right at all. We also have leaks so often, which almost never happened before with the old baby dry. Since Amazon started sending us this new pampers baby dry, we have had to do laundry so often because of the leaks.Pampers, you could have done better. FYI, we've been using your products for more than 2 years. Now we are seriously thinking about switching to your competitor's product. It is very unfortunate that we can't recommend this pampers dry to our friends any longer.Sincerely,",2
We regularly use Huggies brand diapers but decided to give these a try.  We found them to be comparable to the Huggies diapers we had been using.  We've had no leaking and have been satisfied with these so far.  We still slightly prefer the Huggies diapers but that may just be a personal thing since we're so used to them.  I suspect both brands work equally well and its just up to personal preference and price.,4
"They are a good diaper, but keep in mind they are smaller than otherBrands. Other than that I was satisfied with the purchase",3
"I have read the other reviews with interest, and I agree that paying more for less diapers is not what I want. It may well make me try another brand. But, when I tired out a couple of these new diapers, I did notice a difference. Our baby is currently at the border where a size 3 can lead to some leaks after a long weekend night, but a size 4 is usually just a waste of money. Well, using the new Pampers - no weekend leak so far with size 3. They are probably a bit more absorbent, so we will be able to stay with them for longer. And using size 3 for longer is way cheaper than switching to size 4. So I am happy with the improvements. I take one star off for the price, but overall these new Pampers are a tad better than the old ones.",4
"I religiously used Pampers diapers since my son's birth - 2 for years now. Not anymore. The quality is changed, the quantity is lower and the price is up. For the past two months I washed more wet pants than ever before. Leak after leak after leak. What happened?So disappointing. Switching to Huggies.",1
"I have been using pampers for my three children for a total of almost 6 years. They have very sensitive skin and it has been a life saver at keeping them dry and rash free. The price I got on Amazon made it much more manageable too. That being said, the new price not only makes it much more expensive per diaper, but they quality has also gone down, not up as they claim. As soon as I got the new diapers my 1 year old started soaking through every night where before so never did. I found one of the old diapers and put it on her one night and not only did she not soak though but she wasn't even close. Very disappointed with pampers and will be looking for a new alternative. Pampers will be losing many costumers if this is they way they are doing business, just look at the rating for these diapers. I know I'm done unless they change something.***Update : I called customer service and complained. they wanted to refund my money ($30) in the form of a coupon for more pampers. Not what I was looking for but I figured maybe I could try cruisers. Well the coupons showed up in the form of three $10 coupons that you can't use together, so I can't even replace the box I bought. Terrible customer service and bad business practices. It's time to try Huggies.",1
"I have on more than one occasion found my son's shorts wet due to these new diapers. And it's not from leakage, but from the outside of the diaper getting damp/wet. There have been times this has happened when the diaper isn't overly full, definitely full, but not to the point where it should be wet on the outside. Having been a Pampers only household, I'm not sure what diaper to try next. I saw some reviews complaining about Huggies new diapers having the same problem. :-(",2
"Less diapers, higher price. They've ""enhanced"" the diapers by making them more absorbent and with new graphics. I change my son often enough, so I'm not concerned with absorbency; the old ones were fine. I don't care about the graphics at all. They're plastic devices to hold urine and feces, and frankly, I don't care what they look like.Very disappointing application of the grocery shrink ray. Be straightforward about your price changes - don't hide them like this.",1
"I have been a Pampers user for all 3 of my kids (2 now in training pants, one still in diapers). I am disappointed in the recent change I see to my subscribe and save order, with 3 in Pampers a price increase is a big deal to me. The absorbancy has been fine for all my kids, I don't see why more absorbancy was added. My kids like to be changed right after they go in their diaper, and even if they didn't I still would change it when I notice the diaper is soiled or wet, including night time changes. Who wants to lay in a wet diaper all night long, I wouldn't and I don't expect my kids to do so either. Have an overnight version that costs more if you really want to go this route with 12 hour absorbancy, but please bring back our old option for those who were happy with the way things were.",2
"It can't be just a coincidence that as soon as the product changed, my son immediately began having leaks at night again. I don't know what kind of research pampers did, but in my opinion, they seem thinner and LESS absorbent than before! I've been a pampers customer my son's entire life and leaks usually mean he's due for the next size, but he most certainly is not at this time based on his size. I had one night where it only offered 7 hours of protection. 3AM wake ups due to wet PJs and sheets are unacceptable!What I'd like to know is...what does the (alleged) increase in absorbency have to do with the reduction in diaper count? If they were thicker, I'd understand. If they actually were more absorbent and allow me to require less diapers, I'd understand. But neither of these are true.Such a headache... now i have to find another diaper that works.",2
I've been happily using Pampers Baby Dry for seven years with all 5 of my children. This last shipment contained a redesigned product that is significantly less absorbent than the old product. It is so disappointing. I'm changing diapers 3x more frequently now (perhaps that's what Pampers wanted). My daughter complains because the diapers sag now. I canceled my Amazon subscription for these diapers and I will be shopping for a new brand.,1
"I have used Pampers with my son since the beginning and I have always been satisfied...until now. I purchased Baby-Dry and this type has certainly not kept my baby dry! I am doing twice as many diaper changes because of constant leaks and for the first time ever his pajamas and outfits are getting soaked in the front. Because of the constant leaking and non-absorbency my son is also experiencing diaper rash for the first time in 17 months! I also agree that the tapes appear to be very chintzy....I have actually pulled them off four separate times when fastening the diaper, that's four diapers wasted and at the cost for less diapers per box it is just not worth it.I've read the Pampers comments to the reviews and while I can appreciate that they've added more absorbency to the diapers (though, honestly....I don't see it and my son certainly isn't feeling it)I would rather have a thicker diaper and sturdier tapes.Less diapers + more leaks + weak tapes + diaper rash = 1 unhappy, wet babySorry Pampers...but when we use this last diaper (and with constant diaper changes it will be soon) we are going to try another diaper.",1
Why would you not expect pampers to do it too? From milk to halloween candy to the size of a bbag of chips pay attention they are all doing it. Are you going to refuse to buy every single product that has had to make adjustments to cope? I think not!!!I'm expecting baby number 4 next month and have been loyal to pampers for the last six years since my first was born. Go ahead and switch to luvs (I did once and used one diaper and had ti give box away because of rash) or hugggies. You get what you pay for. Other diapers stink in comparison. And any time in the last 6 years ive had a problem withtabs ripping or anything else ive called cs and they have always helped me and went above and beyond. So why keep complaining? Just switch. I'm sure a lot of you will switch back!!!!!,5
"My son has been in Pampers Baby Dry for his whole life - he is 2 1/2. Recently something changed with his diapers...with the last box we purchased I noticed that they look and feel completely different. The new design has tiny little polka dots and the outer material felt noticeable thinner and not as soft. I didn't think much about this at all until the next morning his diaper leaked!! It wasn't just leaking around the elastic on the legs, but it was actually leaking THROUGH the diaper material in the front. I thought maybe it was a fluke, but from that point on his pjs were consistently wet ever morning until I finally changed and moved him up to the next size diaper. The larger diaper is now HUGE on him, but that is what it took to get the absorbency we had before their ""improvements"". There is no way this is a coincidence. The ""new and improved"" diaper is somehow thinner and less absorbent despite what they claim. I am so over Pampers suckering me into paying more money for a lesser quality product. I just had a new baby boy and he went straight into Huggies because that's what they had at the hospital. They are amazing! They are super thick and they have an awesome stretchy elastic band in the back that keeps the diaper from pulling away from his body. I recommend everyone else that is disappointed with the Pampers redesign to make the switch to Huggies.",1
"Less Diapers same price, seeya Pampers!  We used them for our first daughter, now I just went to order some for our newborn and I see the prices increased per diaper... Less diapers same price.  Off to shop for alternatives.",1
"I had read some of the negative comments people left about the 'new and improved' Pampers diapers before ordering, but decided to give them a whirl anyway. We've been a devoted Pampers family since my 2-year-old son was born and Pampers Baby Dry diapers were the only ones that would keep my little belly sleeper dry at night.My box of Pampers Baby Dry diapers arrived today and we dug right into them this afternoon. Unfortunately, 3 out of the first 5 diapers we attempted to use in the box, resulted in the tapes on each side of the diaper completely separating from the diaper itself. At first I thought maybe I was just being rough, until my husband did the next diaper change and the same thing happened to him! And then it happened a third time too. It was definitely the diaper itself failing and not us being too rough or pulling to hard on the tapes.We never had this problem with the old version of this diaper. Not once! Definitely not acceptable when you're paying premium prices for a name brand diaper.Above and beyond the issues I had with the tapes, I'm really not that crazy about the new material being used in this diaper. It's pretty thin and papery. It just feels cheap to me and a lot less soft. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of a H****** brand diaper (which I never buy.).I definitely had a lot of respect for the Pampers brand and quality up until now. I guess I just expected a better product out of them. This new design definitely seems like a huge downgrade in quality compared to the older version and no amount of spin regarding increased absorbency is going to change that for me.Honestly, I'm really sad about this whole thing because I LOVE Pampers Baby Dry diapers and this now means I have to go find a new brand of diaper for my 2-year-old. I'm not looking forward to it.One final note unrelated to the product- Amazon was AMAZING in how they handled the return/refund for this purchase. It's the reason I always am and always will be a devoted Amazon customer.",1
"Classic example of a company trying to improve a product that does not need improving! Why did they have to change my beloved Baby Dry diapers? I have been diapering for the past three and half years now, with both a boy and girl, and Baby Dry has always been my favorite diaper. I have done diaper challenges several times with brand names, store brands, all types within a brand, etc., and Baby Dry has always come in first place. I did not know they changed them until I got my last delivery with subscribe and save and opened the package to see the new design. At first, that is all I thought that was changed, but sadly, it was not. The cut/shape/fit is no longer the same and does not work well at all. The other day, I had two leaks in one day with these diapers. My daughter is 13 months old and is changed often. This should not be happening at this rate, at this age! Unacceptable! I can't wait to finish this box and buy something different. And the best part is they are charging more for less diapers!",2
"I've been using Pampers since my first son was born almost 8 years ago, I've tried other brands-here & there, and nothing even compares. Baby Dry are my go to diaper after the Swaddlers.",5
"This particular product was also a ""Baby Shower Gift."" Therefore, this will save the family from buying this particular size of diapers for awhile.",5
"These diapers are so soft and absorbent, but sooo expensive! We use Luvs during the day when baby is changed more frequently, and Pampers at night when baby goes longer.",5
"Very very impressed  with the price and the box wasn't as damaged as I expected.  Will purchase again for sure,",5
"Despite Pampers' denials, I know that Dry Max (or something in the diapers) creates rashes and burns on my kid's bum.  The minute I changed to these, they stopped.  Haven't had any major problems with leaks.Great for my baby!",5
"Between the two, pampers are way better than huggies.  Although the Velcro fasteners are easier to use on the huggies, they tend to leak on big loads, pampers seem able to hold more.",4
"Just as listed. thank you , what a great bargain, will be back to get plenty more, sister has twins coming in august!!!!",5
Exactly what we ordered!  Fit perfect and great value!  Love that it comes to my door and I don't have to go anywhere,5
I love pampers brand. Have been buying them since I had my first baby in 2008. They are perfect fit,5
These diapers are awful.Pros:It's a diaper.Cons:It's not absorbant. One tiny pee and diaper is full.Smells very strongly of fragrance. The box of diapers in my room makes it smell horrible in here.Leaks. Not an appropriate diaper for night time.Near the tabs it chafes her skin very badly.,1
Excellent better than swaddler. Best fit for my baby. Prompt service. Thanks pampers baby dry and amazon c c c,5
"Love the Pampers Brand!!! Rarely are there leaks, defects, little one can play without droop, etc. I only have positive remarks for these diapers!!!",5
This purchase was a gift for a friend and his wife who were expecting very soon. They were highly pleased with the gift as it took one more worry off their minds!,5
"It seldom leaks.I don't like the fact it's made in occupied territory in Israelbut can't totally boycott the consumer product I like.Diapers are diapers anyway, they work for me well.",5
"I am a firm believer in every child is different, so not every diaper will work. When we had our son, Pampers were great until he started crawling, then we had to switch brands (much to my chagrin, because the Pampers were a better deal!). Now that we have a daughter (2 years old and extremely active) we thought we'd try the Pampers again. They have been amazing! Where other brands leak or leave little bits of fluff stuck to her bottom, the Pampers don't. Ever. I've never had bits of fluff stuck to her bottom, even after a long night and a really, really, really wet diaper. Nothing. It's amazing. There isn't any gaping at the sides, top, bottom, leg holes, anywhere. Other brands, where there could possibly be a leak, there was. The Papers baby dry diapers are the best diapers we've used this time around, and we're gonna stick with them until she's potty trained. Because, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",5
"I really like these diapers bc they hold so much poo!  My 4 month old likes to have explosive diapers about once a week.  Some other diapers have leaked with those explosions, but these have yet (fingers crossed!) to leak out.  They fit well around the legs and waist, and my baby doesn't fuss when he has a wet diaper.",5
Reason being diaper could of formed comfortably to babys body  alil more.  Saggy diaper is the cause for unhappy baby,4
"Pampers may be a little bit pricier sometimes, but you get what you pay for, quality.  This diapers are quite absorbent, and fit well.  I've tried some others in a pinch(when we've run out), but nothing compares to the Pampers.",5
"I use it for my 4 month old baby boy day and night, seems fine, no leak, no rash, no mess.",5
I have used baby dry diapers on both my babies and I love them.  They have never had a skin irritation with these diapers and they are extremely absorbent.  I use them as my overnight diapers - when I'm too afraid to trust the cloth diaper for overnight.  My eldest was a chunky chubby baby and my youngest is on the smaller side- and the diaper fit great on both of them.  These are my favorite diapers and I love the updated sesame street design!  Great absorbency and awesome fit.,5
"We are totally a pampers family and these have saved us many a super soak at night, although there have still been a few soak through occasions  but that has more to do with how much our LO goes ALL AT ONCE (surprise!) vs. the diaper itself.",4
"Out of all the diapers that i have tried, pampers are my favorite. They stay on, there is no leaking out of the tops or sides, and it moves with him.",5
"I too have noticed a negative change with these particular pampers diapers. I have repeatedly ripped the tab off of one side when putting on a new diaper. ...which means wasted money. They also do not have good elasticity in the back because my child has had many poops run out and up her back, so I finally ordered Huggies and these seem to be working out much better! Pretty disappointed pampers!",3
"We always use Pampers diapers but these were the WORST! First night in them, and our son was dripping when we picked him up out of his crib in the morning.  Already ordering a different brand.",1
"it leaks and dirties the sheets for many times. make us so unhappy. it is really aweful, I wish I can return some remains.",1
"Love this great deal and how easy it is to move to a new size, or even return merchandise that no longer fits.",5
"I liked the diapers, thought they were great for holding in wetness over night. Just a bummer that my daughter is allergic to them...",4
"As always, Pampers keeps my baby dry and has a good fit.  Shipment is always on time and reliable. I will continue to use this product until my baby is potty trained.",5
"I use cloth diapers 90% of the time, but put a disposable on my 10-month old son for nighttime.  I've tried Huggies, Seventh Generation, Earth's Best, and Pampers.  As much as I would prefer to use one of the more ""green"" brands, Pampers Baby Dry does the best job for us.",5
Almost all diapers are functional and the size are big enough for our big baby. But one interesting thing is that one package of diapers in the box totally have no elastic bands on them. I have no idea why this weird thing happens. Then I contacted Amazon's customer service. And I got refund of half box of diapers. So I can only rate it 4 stars instead of 5 since there are defective items in it.,4
"Of course diapers are the most expensive part of having a child.  Considering this is the first for my husband and I, we have been learning a lot as we go.  One day we discussed the idea of ordering the diapers after comparing prices at multiple brick and mortar stores, and we definitely got a deal this way!I would recommend this to anyone.  Now, we had to order another box before our next shipment, because we don't like to keep her in a diaper forever (pro- NO diaper rashes)!!!",5
"The new version is bigger than the old one, and with real new longer absorbency layer, my boy feels so good with this new baby dry diapers.",5
"I've been using Pampers Swaddlers since my daughter was born. On our trip to Germany to visit family my mother bought Pampers Baby Dry (I didn't see the Swaddlers offered overseas). After 2 weeks of trying the Pampers Baby Dry I decided to switch my subscription back home to these and I honestly can't tell a difference other than the money saved. My daughter hasn't had a leak, no diaper rash (knocks on wood), nothing to complain about.  My husband and I have occasionally laid out the diaper the wrong way (the back being at the front), but that's not really a products fault. I personally love the cute characters on the diaper. :)Will keep buying these!",5
"We have these delivered every month as a gift for our grandson, and the boxes come on time and in great condition.  We have had to exchange for a different size once and it was done without hassle.",5
This is the only brand of diapers that I have used that I haven't had trouble with poop coming out of the leg holes or leaking in the middle of the night.  I will never go back to the cheaper brands because it just isn't worth the time or expense of cleaning up what the diaper should be holding in.,5
"Now that she is sleeping through the night, these hold all of her ""business"" for the entire time. No leaks. Love them!",5
It is the most convinant way to buy this big box of diapers. It helps you to safe your time and money from getting a store every few days.,5
I never have any leaking issues with these diapers as I have had with huggies or any other brand. I highly recommend these if you're going to be using disposable diapers.,5
"Pampers Baby Dry have always been my favorite type of Pampers. Size 5 is great for my 2 year old because they are big enough to hold all the urine that he produces through the night. He wakes up dry, no leaks.",5
"I've tried all brands (target, huggies, luvs, etc) and the pampers stand out.  Don't waste your time and money with any other brand that will irritate or cause a rash on your baby.  pampers seems to be the most comfortable for our kid.",4
"used  huggies since birth,  and  so disappointed very sake, but had decided to try pampers , and so happy do not leak, smell delicious, happy baby and very easy to close))",5
"Why the diapers do not different from girls and boys? My baby poops a lot, and always it go out of the diapers. the back of the diaper don't have absorbant things,only plastics.",4
I'm horrified!  My little girl is 21 months and has never had a diaper rash before!  I've been a loyal Pamper buyer.  It's so awful that my little girl has to go through the pain like she is.  I've been going through the best diaper rash ointments money can buy and it's breaking my hear to see her like this.,1
As my child got older I tried switching to huggies brand but quickly realized that they are not as soft as pampers and the child was very uncomfortable wearing those. So switched to these and I am very happy with the switch.,5
"It is a box of diapers, how could it go wrong.  It is a box if diapers, how could it go wrong.",5
I love that they have sesame street characters on them but I didn't love the way they fit and leaking was a constant worry.,3
"i dont remember how many times i ordered pampers diapers for my little boy, this is the first i felt disappointed by the diapers i've got. it smells very wired.",2
"Pampers.... Says it all....works great, no leaks, no rash if you change your baby in aimlessly manner.  Moving up to size 2, same brand!",5
"After switching from Luvs to Pampers Baby Dry for nighttime use, I have to say--I'm blown away that they actually do what they claim to do.For months, my son has been waking up in the middle of the night with a swollen diaper and soaked onesie, and then again at his normal wake-up time with the same issue. This week, since I've been putting him in his new diapers, we've had one small wet spot--and that's only because the diaper wasn't fastened tight enough.",4
"I think something is wrong with this type of Pampers! Most of them are perfect, but sometimes one is not good and leaks! I am upset because just one little nap of 1 hour and a half and I had to change sheet, pad and blanket! I don't have time for that! In the last two weeks I already changed three times! Something is wrong! You guys who worked on this new type have to say ""excuse us"" and do something to solve the problem. Pampers is a very good brand to let this mistake happen without doing anything! Parents are complaining for the last half year without any apology from you guys and without solving the problem. It was my first time buying it. Before I used another Pampers because my baby was small without any problem but for number 3 I bought this trouble-making pampers diaper! Poor me! Today I am buying Huggies that are not so delicate like Pampers but they are good too!",2
"These work great for our newborn! Once we made sure they were centered on her little bum, no more blowouts!",5
"I used luvs diapers which constantly made terrible fungal rashes for my baby... looks like he has sensitive skin or something... ever since i switched to pampers, no more rashes Thank God, He should continue to help. So if your baby suffers... go for pampers, even it's more expensive. You won't regret, i didn't :). A SUPER SATISFIED CLIENT.",5
"I've read all of the reviews about the change in packaging, etc, but I still prefer Pampers over any other brand. We've tried a lot of them, from the generic Babies'R'Us to Huggies, and we've always come back to Pampers for the fit and the way they keep our daughter from getting diaper rash. She stays dry in them all night (11-12 hours), and we've very rarely had any issues with leaking.",5
Gentle on baby and easy clean up for parents. No leaks or mess. I've tried other diapers but this one is not a bulky on baby.,5
"I swear by the wetness indicators, and ordered this thinking that it had indicators - but it was actually Pampers Swaddlers that had one, and not this...",2
"Very good value for the price. I will not need to purchase diapers for the month, if not longer. I'm seriously considering the subscription. They arrived very quickly, too.",5
Everything I want in a diaper. At first I used pampers swaddlers but it wasn't keeping my little one dry through the night. After I made the switch I had no more problems.,5
We have used it before. It works great. Although it doesn't work 12 hrs as said. May be 7-8 hrs. I would recommend this product.,5
I have used Pampers with both of my girls. They do not leak and I have never had a skin reaction. I have sometimes used other brands in a pinch or sometimes trying to save money. They always leak or have caused terrible diaper rash.The only diaper for my family.,5
"Switched from using Cruisers to BabyDry to save some money. The only difference we've seen is that the outside of the Cruisers are softer...but who cares about the outside!! We love the Baby Dry. They keep our little one dry as can be, no irritation, no rashes, no leaks...and they're less expensive! I would like to add that my husband thinks they smell funny- I think they smell the same as Cruisers.",5
i am very pleased with the quality of this product and the price i paid for it. I was using the swaddlers but they are a little more expensive than the baby dry.,5
I was using swaddlers since my son was born. I had no issue with swaddlers. Loved them. My mom bought some of the baby dry diapers for my son. I hate them! He started having blow outs consistently with them. They just don't hold as well. Also they are not as soft. Stick with the swaddlers. You get what you pay for.,1
"I love these!!! I don't have to worry about my daughter filling these diapers and ending up wet. While using the cruisers, I would change her every 2-3 hours and she would be wet because the diapers were too full or leaked. No worries with these Baby Dry diapers!",5
"use this brand for a long time till my baby is 3 year old. the other major brands cause redness, this is the best.",5
My baby loves to take HUGE dumps in these. My only complaint is that when removed they smell very BAD!,5
These diapers were okay but leaked. Going back to swaddlers didn't see much of a difference other than the pad being thinner,3
"Love the pampers, great amount for an even better price. Would recommend it to any parent.  Very convenient, will definitely order again.",5
"It worked for our little  guy! Never had a problem, held him very well.We are moving onward to pull-up world now.",4
"I send this to my grandson every month. Good product, great service. Good fit. Nicely absorbent. You know what you are getting, Pampers is a great product.",4
my daughter use pamper diaper.. the diaper from this package is really different from other same pamper with bigger box size.. and it is not as comfortable and soft and other ones we use..,3
"I hate these changes! I can understand the raise in price/ lowered number in the box with the economy, we're all taking the hit and while we don't like it...back to the product",5
i have been using this specific brand and line of diapers- these diapers feel slimmer than other brands but had no problem with leaks so far. my boy also always seem to be comfortable with it on. i only wish that pampers bring back the promotional packet containing extra diapers for the same price!,4
Love ordering diapers from my computer because I don't even have to go to store or carry boxes. It saves time and it is always on time!,5
"these are great diapers progressing from the swaddlers, don't expect them to be just as soft as swaddlers but they are more economical and still work well and is acceptable in quality in the softness for our family.",5
Love these diapers- best diapers in my opinion. Have used them on both my babies and rarely get any leaks. They keep my babies dry. Have tried other brands and think pampers is the best and especially like baby dry. Highly recommend these!,5
so much better for boys than the huggies I have been buying. These fit my 2.5 yr old so much better and his little winky wasn't sticking out over the stop like his other diapers. They are very stretchy and don't leak.,5
Three boys and we have used pampers for all of them. Wouldn't use anything else. Love subscribe and save. So worth it!,5
"We started with Pampers first because that is what the nurses used in the hospital when our son was born. It is not as cost effective as some other diaper brands, however, so we decided to try a couple other brands (Huggies and one other, can't remember). They were such cheaper quality and leaked out so much more that we quickly went back to Pampers. Pampers is thicker and our son has never had a problem with them.",4
I use Luvs day time and these during nights. Sometimes there are accidents for the morning but they work closer to 12 hrs. Am happ with them,4
"I always buy Pampers for my 14 month old and have never had a problem with the brand until buying a box of the new Baby Dry diapers. They do not have the absorbancy or the cloth like texture of the older version. They leak when only moderately wet (and definitely can't be worn overnight unless you're interested in changing the crib sheet at 1am) and they're always coming undone (I've found them bunched up in the leg of her pants at least three times). After four days of wearing them, my daughter developed a diaper rash. These are low quality diapers at a high quality price. Wtf, Pampers?",1
The value was good and it's hard to beat Pampers for absorbancy. Bought these for a new set of parents.,4
Love how well pampers keeps my baby dry. I have been using them since she was born and they gave us some at the hospital. Always pleased with it,5
"I purchased these for my newborn and she peed out of them so quickly! I am astonished that this claims to be dry for 12 hours and yet, they are on my little girl for a couple hours and it leaks! Since I've already opened them, I'm kind of screwed on my options and will have to bite the bullet while buying different diapers and not being able to return this package. Ugh.",1
"It's such a relief being a mother of two young children in diapers, that I don't have to lug boxes of diapers in and out of stores.  This trusted brand that I would purchase in the store comes delivered to my front step once a month.",5
"I can't find a big box like this at local store.  After I calculate unit price per diaper, this box has a lowest price per diaper.  Will order again if I need it.",5
Great economy purchase. With 2 babies in diapers this is a great way to save money and as a prime member have them delivered right to your doorstep fast and easy!,5
"I prefer the Pampers brand and they fit my daughter great...except for these. Normally we use Swaddlers  but I found a good deal on these and ordered them. I don't like that they do not have a wetness indicator. Although, it's not hard to tell when the diaper is full. My daughter seems to wet though these more often that the Swaddlers.",2
this is the only diaper we like and with subscribe and save I now get it cheaper than any store. I tell every mommy I meet about this great way to save money.,5
"Nothing negative to say, other than it would be nice if they could handle to volume generated during sleep so that I could use 1 set of diapers.",5
"My son just turned 2, and we have been using Pampers since he was born. Of course we have tried many other types as well, but we always go back to Pampers because we love them the most. If you sign up for ""subscribe and save"" on Amazon you can have them delivered to your house on a regular schedule! It's been so simple, we never run out of diapers! There are 160 in this specific box, and they will easily last one month, so we are on a monthly delivery schedule. My son is only 25 lbs, but we have him in size 5 because it felt like a better fit for us. He can still fit on the 4s, but it just felt so much easier to put on the 5s.",5
Love the brand. One box a month is the perfect amount. Love how it arrives at my door on time every month.,4
"This is the only diaper that my son is wearing.No leak, no problems.Excellent for active baby like him.I had tried many other brands before, Pampers Baby Dry is the only one that I get always!",5
I love Pampers. Used them the whole way with the twins. Held up and I've never had leak...that wasn't my fault anyway ;),5
I was using Pampers Swadlers ever since coming from the hospital and change to these two weeks ago. I am so disappointed. These are the reasons:1. It leaks all the time. Especially at night. from the top.  (I have a boy.)2. Terrible for a heavy poop. Leaks from the sides.3. For the first time my son got diaper Rash! I actually wash my son everytime he poops so he doesn't get diaper rash and because the material is not breathable it burnt my son.3. They are not soft AT ALL!If you want a peace of mind and do not want to have outfits ruined or be out in the public completely in a terrible situation avoid these at all costs and pay the extra money for the swadlers.,1
I love pampers. They are the only brand I trust for my infants! I trusted them the first time and now the second time around I trust them even more!,5
My son is 22 Months and nothing else has been on his tushy but pampers. We love them 100 percent,5
"Price forced me to look elsewhere.  Huggies is 38 (-6 on current manufacture coupon = 32). compared to 48 for the same amount of diapers.  2 months ago the price for these was 45. Plus, my 20 pound daughter is leaking at night on these from the top.  She sleeps with her butt in air and it leaks from the waistband on occasion.  Thicker waist band requested. Product is decent but not great.  Price is too much.",3
"I've purchased Pampers diapers for both of my children. I've tried other brands but found Pampers work best for us. We are currently using size 4. I like the light scent, I like that they're not very ""plasticy"" or bulky because we live in a warm climate and other diapers have caused my children to have sweaty bottoms, and up until recently I liked that they were very absorbent despite the lack of bulkiness. Until they rolled out the new version I was a very happy customer. Now I find them to be consistently leaky. Unless my child poops, we are in a routine where changes take place at fairly set times of the day. Before the ""new"" diapers this worked well for us. Occasionally diapers would leak at night, but they were always extremely full and I don't think any diaper would have held up. With the new version we are having leaks on a pretty regular basis during the day and when the leaky diapers are removed they are surprisingly not that wet. Also, the diaper's lack of ability to hold moisture has been causing a slight but persistent rash. Because of the more frequent changes we are going through more diapers which is annoying since one of the ""improvements"" Pampers made was to significantly decrease the number of diapers in the pack (12) while maintaining the same price.",2
"These diapers are the best I have come across so far. I've tried Huggies and Luvs, but the Pampers seem to hold up the best. We rarely have any leaks and they don't irritate my baby's skin.",5
The only thing I wish it had would be the wetness indicator that the other versions have.  But the rest is great!,4
"Older or larger babies may need a bit of extra coverage, especially during the night.Pampers have performed very well, no middle of the night clean ups.  When combined with Pampers wipes and Amazon's repeat delivery program, the price is good, delivery is spot on and it's a relief to know this important item is taken care of.",4
"I've never cared about brands.  If it soaked up and kept in what it was supposed to, I would use it if the price was right.  I've got nothing against name brands, but with 6 kids, and the oldest being disabled, money is tight and Pampers are expensive.  My sister sent me a box of these for my newest addition.  I was happy to set aside the cloth diapers and the cheapies to give these center stage.  The biggest problem I have with them is that now I don't want to go back to using the cheaper ones.  I honestly think I used less of the Baby Dry version than my cheaper diapers.  Maybe I can justify just one more box... ;)UPDATE: I'm not sure what the difference is in the last box I purchased and this box, but these are not worth an increased price!  The box I got before was great as stated above.  This recent box, however, made me just want to hurry through it.  Nothing stays in.  He leaks all of the time.  I keep reading where the Pampers representatives are commenting that it's increased absorbency, but I'm not seeing it.  It may absorb, but it doesn't lock the moisture in or away from the baby.  Maybe the factory that's making them is making changes w/o the company's knowledge, but these definitely are lesser quality not greater!  I've changed my rating to reflect the changes in the diapers.  Just for the record, my baby gets changed more frequently now than with store brands or cloth diapers due to leakage.",2
"I agree with some of the other reviews about Pampers Baby Dry and their occasional lack of effectiveness. Sometimes they leak. However, I have yet to find another brand that rivals Pampers. Sometimes my husband comes home with Huggies because he wants to save a few pennies, but I prefer Pampers. We have two children (and one on the way), and we have tried many diapers. We have yet to find one that prevents leaks every time. The cheaper brands tend to leak more and just feel cheaply made. Pampers is the best in our opinion.",4
"I love pampers diapers, they are the only ones that I have found that really hold in that pee smell.  With other brands it seemed like as soon as my boys would pee you could smell it half way across the room!  I recommend pampers to everyone!",5
"they can hold a whole lotta pee, y'all. you can certainly get your pennies worth on these.  no gross gel leakage, no crispy sound, no super thick waddle material.  toddler approved.",5
There amazing. Both my 2 year old wore these. And now my 3 month old wears them.  They really are baby dry.,5
"This size has fit my now-3-year old for such a long time.  She's day-potty trained and has been for a year, but still wears a night time diaper.  These work perfectly well and are cheaper than pull-ups or any of the other fancy toddler-marketed products.",5
My baby does well with this diaper. It does its job and the price is lower than swaddlers or cruisers.,5
"Over the years there have been several changes to diapers but as of late there haven't been many changes. These diapers work as described. Just like normal, depending on the baby and how much fecal matter they release, there is a little spillage just like any other brand. All in all it is a decent diaper.",4
We have better luck with Baby Dry than any other diaper as far as leaks. The diapers were a good price and delivered quickly.,5
"We we're using Huggies and kept having ""poop blowouts"", switched to pampers and no more problems. Not a bulky diaper",4
"Got these for our grandbaby. pampers are high quality, good fitting. Very happy with them. And, they go clear up to size 7!",5
Pampers is the only diaper that keeps my baby from leaking through at night.  Any other diaper I have tried gets leaks and results in a rash.  I love Pampers & I don't mind the slight quantity change.,5
"We used Pampers diapers when our daughter was born almost 8 years ago and were happy with them.  When our son arrived, we chose to grab the tried and true Pampers brand and use them.  We have had some difficulty with these diapers but mainly at night.  Sometimes, granted its not an every night incident, but when he wakes up in the morning the diaper has leaked a little.  I do not want my son to be sleeping in a wet diaper that has gotten his clothing and sheet wet.  I will have to look into a more dependable diaper to use for him at night because even if it's not a nightly occurence it still is not acceptable.  I need a dependable diaper that will last through the night.I gave them two stars instead of one because they seem to work fine during the day while he is playing and for shorter naps.  I hope that the absorbance issue can be fixed and we can use them all the time.",2
"These have become our preferred diapers, with the exception of one detail.They are lightweight and fit our baby well.  They smell good (until they are used, of course!).  They feature a pleasant light color green material that is soft and non abrasive.  So far, they have not caused any rashes on the baby bottom.Our only wish is that they had the wetness indicator stripe on the outside that changes color when the diaper is wet.  Diligent and routine diaper changes and checks by the parents make the wetness indicator stripe less of an issue, so it isn't too big of a deal.We will continue to use these diapers in the future.",4
"Best diapers for overnight. Never leaks overnight, even with a baby boy. Fits long so as to come up high enough to cover everything and hold it all in.",5
"Stay away from these.  Very bad quality.  Pampers are not the cheapest, yet these have much lower quality than others that are nearly half the price.  The absorbent material frequently comes out of the diaper and all over my house.  I've had more ""semi-solid leaks"" than usual with these also.  A few have ripped while I was putting them on.My son has also developed a rash, these diapers being the only change.I've had similar experiences with other diapers over the last 10 months.  But just in the past week of using these I would say I have roughly doubled the diaper failure rate.Going back to the last brand before my wife kills me.",1
"I have 3 children (so have changed LOTS of diapers), and have used Pampers almost exclusively with my now 8-month-old son. I usually purchase their Baby Dry diapers, so decided to try this ""improved"" product. I honestly do not notice a difference. They are still great and never ever leak just as always, hence the 5-star rating.",5
I purchased these for my grandson unknowing of the reviews that are negative about them.My grandson has developed a VERY RED SERIOUS RASH and the doctor attributes the causeto these diapers.I guess there is no recourse but to dispose of them.,1
"Let me start by saying that these are the only diapers I buy for my 17m son!!! Now as someone else mentioned I will be shopping for a new brand. I haven't noticed any ""improvements"" not only do you get less for your money, but now more than ever the tabs seem to be stuck to the diaper I've had to throw some of them away because I peeled the whole tab off the diaper trying to get the tape undone... And my little one does seem to have more leaks..I live in a smaller town so I have only been using the newer version for about a couple of months (tried to give them a chance...aforementioned leaks, and tape disasters occurred)I am actually diaper shopping now but wanted to review these because they are just such a disappointment!!!!",2
"I used to love Pampers Baby Dry. It was all I ever used with both kids. A few months ago I recieved a box of their ""thinner, more absorbent"" diaper and was very disappointed. Not only did they leak but my son broke out in the most horrible rash. I didnt immediately associate it with the diaper so the poor guy looked like he had chemical burn. I even took him to the Doctor and got a Rx cream but nothing helped. Then I switched diapers and boom, the rash started going away. To test my diaper theory I put them on him again (during the day only to limit exposure) and within a day he started getting the beginning of the same prickly rash. Its really too bad too because this was the only diaper my 2 1/2 year old had ever really worn until this. Pampers PLEASE go back to the original Baby Dry formulation!",2
Great diapers keep them dry all night.  I gave it 3 stars because pampers cut their boxes from 192 or 196 down to 180 and the price stayed the same.,3
Good price for the quantity & mommy & baby are happy with the quality of these diapers.  Keeping my granddaughter from leaking on all her fashionalble outfits!,4
Have been using these dipaers ever since our first child. We still use them for our second child and they never fail.,5
These worked very well for our daughter since she was a baby and she is now almost two. I can't remember her ever going through them.,5
"I've tried Huggies and off brand diapers and pampers just work way better for our boy. To give you a body type he's about 20th percentile in both height and weight but is big in the torso and small in the butt and legs. He's a heavy wetter particularly at night (tummy sleeper) and very active during the day (crawling and pulling up to stand at 6 mo). We got pampers swaddlers in the hospital when he was born, but after using them up tried the huggies and other brands given to us as shower gifts with terrible sucess so back to pampers we went and donated most of the others, because I was tired of soaking breastmilk poo out of all his clothes and blankets. I sent his dad to the store to grab diapers one night and he came back with baby dry rather than swaddlers and I was a bit skeptical for about half a day. These diapers are freaking awesome.I too used to buy the larger count diaper boxes here on amazon, but I'm not pissed about the change as many other reviewers on here seem to be. First of all there are only 18 less diapers per box. Second the price is a couple dollars less than the older slightly larger box. Third and most importantly while we used to have to change our son once in the night to prevent leakage, the new and improved baby dry actually do keep him dry from 10pm to 9am without a middle of the night change. In my opinion totally worth the extra fraction of a cent per diaper.",5
"These diapers are great.  I've never had leakage problems and they really do hold a lot!  Also, quality has definitely improved, as they were starting to feel very tissue paper like and would break at the velcro.  They have definitely improved this and are now more durable.",5
"These are great diapers! They are not bulky, but they are very absorbent. They allow air to get to the skin when dry to keep skin healthy. We got some luvs diapers as a gift, I got rid of that brand because I could see my child's skin was wet at changing time, whereas it was not wet with pampers. I am a loyal pampers user.",5
We love these diapers and getting them auto shipped has been a godsend with three kids! I love subscribe and save.,4
I would recommend it for sure. We used different ones before and it was a nightmare to go through the night. My baby is 8 month and you think it should be fine to go through the night without changing if no belly movements. But since we found this one she is absolutely happy baby and easily goes all night without changing.,5
We tried this type after using pampers cruisers for over a year. It leaks all the time and does not hold much fluid. not recommended at all.,1
"We love these diapers for boys and girls!  Besides the night time ones, they have the fewest leaks in these.",5
"As a father of 8 I've seen and changed a lot diapers. We have another little one in our home, so we were excited to give the Pampers Baby Dry Diapers a try. What I appreciated most is that they offer up to 12 hours of overnight protection. No early wet wake up calls with Pampers Baby Dry Diapers. Besides overall sturdy construction, the other big feature to note is the price. At the time of this review the economy pack with 222 size 2 diapers comes in at a cost of 20 cents per diaper. Having spent thousands of dollars on diapers over the years, I most certainly know that's a GREAT deal! My overall rating is 5 out of 5 stars.",5
"I've been a longtime Pampers fan. Over the past year, however, I've had the opportunity to try several of the other big-name brands, as well as some smaller brands on my second daughter. While most of them function ok, they don't seem to perform as well overall as the Pampers Baby Dry in terms of wetness holding capacity, apparent comfort, and durability.",5
Simple message to potential buyers..... Consider other brands and try others first before ordering large quantities. New and improved is a marketing slogan in this case. Previous diapers performed better and were better value as these new ones leak MORE and you get less per case so per unit cost is Higher for a Less effective product. Company needs to return to previous product or they will lose many long-time and new customers period!!!,2
"After a year of trying others, slightly less expensive diapers, we've finally given up and all we are buying now are Pampers.  We still have the occasional blowout, but not NEARLY what we had with other diapers.  My daughter has also developed rashes with other diapers, but never with Pampers.  The Baby Dry diapers work well overnight for her and keep her dry for the 12+ hours she sleeps at night (yes, we're very thankful for 12 straight hours of sleep!).  I get these on the subscription service delivered every month.  It saves me from having to run to a store, and this is actually a lot cheaper too.  It comes in a great big box, just like what is shown in the picture (not an undecorated wholesaler box).  The box doesn't matter to me as long as it gets the diapers to my house undamaged, but some people might want to know that it does come in a normal box in case they are giving it as a gift.",5
"Since Pampers ""upgraded"" their diapers, we've had a terrible time keeping our baby dry through the night. And when you've bought a pack of 204, that's a problem. I've had to buy overnight diapers to use at night time, and even during the day, I have to change my baby much more often to avoid leaks. We have loved Pampers until this recent batch and will not be purchasing from them again.",2
"They work great, we were having leaks at night time with our little girl and these worked great to solve the problem.",5
"Pampers is the BEST.  Our baby boy has sensitive skin and these were the only diapers that didn't bother his skin! :)Also they are great as he crawls, walks and climbs :)They stay on and they are SUPER absorbent! :)LOVE UUUMMM!!!",5
"They're not as good as they used to be.  These diapers were used in a church day care facility where they go through a whole slew of diapers of every brand and price point.  Pampers used to be the best, the one that we all used for comparison. After all, it's not like Pampers is the least expensive of the major national brands. They used to be the ones we counted upon when the little ones went down for a nap, so there wasn't going to be a leak and a change of clothes  at wake-up time.They're using another major brand at nap time these days. I hope that Pampers decides to go back to the way they used to be.",3
"These have been my favorite diapers for both my kids.  They are economical, never leak and don't cause irritation.  I am a little disappointed with the new cover design though, I liked it when they were all white (I am a minimalist).",5
"These are the only diapers that keep up with my 'pee pee queen' :) My daughter drinks alot of water during the day, and as a result, fills up alot of diapers. These are the only diapers I've used that actually last all night so she doesn't wake up soaked head to toe.",4
Love it !!! I try other brands and always have accidents but with pampers baby dry I have not !,5
"I'm a big fan of Pampers diapers.  By all means, they are my favorite kind, and my wife agrees.  I would even say they are worth the high price.  After trying Baby Dry for the first time, I'm not so sure I would extend my favorable opinions about Pampers to this particular diaper.  I previously didn't know the difference between ordinary Pampers and Baby Dry, and many readers of this review may not know either.  The main difference is these diapers contain an extra layer that's super absorbent -- some kind of bluish foam layer, I think.  The idea was to absorb more urine so that the baby could sleep through the night without getting his/her clothes or crib wet.Unfortunately, I think the execution of this ""improvement"" comes up a little bit short.  It's not that the UltraAbsorb layer failed to work.  By all means, it seems to work excellently.  But it causes other problems that outweigh its advantages.  Let me spell them out:*  UltraAbsorb makes the diaper expand to large proportions, visibly swelling the baby's clothes and sometimes even protruding out.  The result is that even an average pee makes the diaper swell so much that it looks and feels like it's full of a bowel movement, with the consequence that my wife and I -- plus the daycare ladies -- end up changing the diapers often when it's unnecessary, simply because we think it's full of poop.  This costs money.  Maybe that's the idea.*  UltraAbsorb also causes problems when it comes to bowel movements.  Because it swells so much after each urination, the diaper gets tight around the butt.  When the baby poops in this swollen and tight diaper, it tends to come out the sides and leg holes because there is no where else for the poop to go.  The absorbent layer has already swelled up and taken all the room.*  My wife and I both think that the urine smell is much stronger and more distinct in Baby Dry.  It's almost like the foam in UltraAbsorb enhances the odor instead of suppressing it.*  The final problem is that the tape on these diapers is rather weak.  I have to admit that it always seems to stick, but just barely. The tape's grip is just not very strong and can easily come loose if the baby were to apply pressure with the hand.  I suspect this is a problem that will be magnified with older infants.That being said, the overall fit of the diaper is nice, they are attractive, and I can see the potential benefits of Baby Dry.  Unfortunately, they come up a little short on the improvements they were trying to make.  I recommend these diapers with reservations and hope to see Pampers make improvements in the future.",3
"These keep our baby so dry, it is difficult to tell when they are wet. They also protect from blowouts - definitely my favorite brand.",5
We have used different brands of diapers but the Pampers have for our kiddos much better.  These large boxes seem to be cheaper.,5
"Great price, however I was disappointed to open the package and the perfume scent was so strong.  I do not feel it is necessary to put these chemicals on babies skin.",2
"With a 14 month old boy, we have had several incidents of leakage across all the diapers like Pampers, Huggies, Luvs etc. The issue became more and more frequent after 9 months+. So far, the Baby Dry have provided the best protection and it lasts very well for about 5-6 hrs. The 12 hr claim is really far stretched and maybe proven by Pampers in their own labs under extremely controlled experimental conditions. We have yet to meet the parents who can back up this claim via their own experience.One thing we have noticed that these diapers have a tendency to collect the wetness mostly up front and do not distribute it evenly. Maybe this is intentional to avoid leakage from the back. But sometimes it gives the false feeling that the diaper is full as it gets big and a bit tight from the front.Overall, so far these are the best diapers, a bit expensive than Luvs or store brands, but the Subscribe and Save price provides some relief to the pocket.",4
"Diapers have changed since my parents used them on me, and when I used them on my older children. Now that we have a new little lady, we want the very best for her. We've tried several brands... Luvs, Parent's Choice, Huggies, and Pampers. the all have their good and bad. I can't say that I have any real quorums with any of them. We have four good days and bad days with any brand. But then, there are a few brands that just are plain bad. The Pampers Baby Dry Diapers are good for us. We've had some leaks and some torn tabs, which are frustrating at the time, but overall they work as intended. I'm not a diaper connoisseur, just a parent trying to contain the leakage.",4
"I've been a fan of Pampers and used different sizes and versions for both my sons. I'm not sure if the style has changed in two years or if I had switched to Luvs already with my first by this time, but I'm having the worst time with poops sliding out the back with my 5 month old.The design of the all Pampers (baby dry, cruisers, swaddlers) for size 3 (I've tried them all) is lacking elastic on the back. It's just flat. So every time that I lay my son down to change his poopy diaper, it shoots  up the backside all over his shirt, pants and changing pad. I need to do laundry almost every time that he poops. It's a huge mess and very frustrating. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of less, is that they are good at holding the pee. My son can go all night without leakage.  My son also has sensitive skin. These do alright in that respect, but I'm still hoping to find better. The great diaper dilemma. I've tried several brands in comparison and included these thoughts to help as well.Pampers cruisers vs baby dry - I like the fit with the baby dry better. I had some leakage around the  legs with the cruisers, especially with my son the side sleeper. The baby dry are also better for sensitive skin. When I ordered the cruisers, a third of the package had the elastic from the edges stuck to the inside where it was folded. I had to toss those out.Huggies little movers - I'm currently using because they contain the poop, although they do not work as well for overnight. So far they seem to be ok for the sensitive skin issue.Luvs- Loved these for my oldest son, especially with the cost savings and never had any issues. With my second they irritated his sensitive skin.Seventh Generation- Tried these to see how they compare for my son's sensitive skin. They are stripped of all fragrance and dyes, which helped somewhat with his skin, although they lack the absorbancy of the other brands. I change frequently to keep him dry, so I'm not impressed when they can't last an hour. They also have an interesting smell to them.",3
This is a much simpler way to buy diapers for a mom of two small children! It comes to my door and is cheaper than in the stores!,5
"I, like most 1st time parents, bought the most expensive diapers I could find.  We have tried them all now - Pampers Swaddlers, Cruisers, Baby Dry, Huggies Snug and Dry, Little Snugglers and Luvs.  These are my favorite.Let me say this - we were buying Huggies Overnight Diapers because our son was leaking through the Cruisers overnight and he started leaking through the overnight diapers too.  I came to Amazon to see if Pampers made overnight diapers to give them a try when I saw the 12 hour leak protection notice on the Baby Dry diapers.  I thought I would give them a dry and worst case scenario, he could wear them during the day.They worked amazingly well and we have never had a leak.  I then realized that we were using Cruisers during the day, when we change him often and the Baby Dry at night which is only one diaper per night.  WHY WAS I SPENDING MORE ON THE DAY DIAPERS?  I now only get the Baby Dry and he uses them day and night.  Great diapers.I wish I had thought to try these earlier.  I would have saved a bundle!",5
I purchased these for my grandson who will be 1 year old at the end of January.  I plan on buying the next size up very soon.  These are great since you get so many & it beats having to go to the grocery store or drugstore to buy a small pack or several of them all at once & these are delivered.,5
"I've always been a Pampers fan. The diapers are softer compared to Huggies. My children never had any diaper rash while using Pampers diapers. I don't see any difference with the new Pampers Baby Dry vs the old version except that there are few diapers in one box for the new one, which means, more $ per diaper. There hasn't been any leaks so far but I don't wait for 12 hours before I change his diaper :-) I don't really rely on the 12-hour advertisement because it always varies from babies to babies. I wonder though how they get that number. On average, my son sleeps for 10 to 12 hours at night and I change his diapers 3 times at night.To summarize: I like this diaper for my son because it's soft. No leaks. No diaper rash.",4
"My son can pee and these rarely leak.  We travel a lot and these diapers have withstood the test for us.  When my son was first born, he had a bad diaper rash and since switching to these, we haven't had any rashes in 8 months.  I also highly recommend Pampers night diapers.",5
I use pampers baby dry for over night use and never had a leak. Thank you for some dry nights!,5
I love these diapers. They are the best. They always stay in place and I love how soft and thin they are.,5
These diapers are the best on the market for leak prevention. Just may sure to get the 12 hour baby dry. Other pampers are not equivalent.,4
I have been buying Pampers for my son since he was born. He's now 2. We have never had any problems with leaks or anything like that.,5
Pampers has always been a go to brand. It is a good product for the price. And it works just as well as some of the more expensive brands. Leaks are minimal if ever and that's what you want. I. Ant comment on the 12 hour protection because who honestly leaves a diaper on a baby for 12 hours?,4
"I have heard other parents claim that other brands work just as well but the few times we've had to use diapers other than  Pampers it has been a disaster. Getting very close to the end of diapering, fingers crossed, but I would use these again in a heartbeat and recommend them to ask my new parent friends.",5
"I've tried just about every brand of diaper, and I must say, pampers is at the top of my list.  They fit well and absorb well.  These even seem to do the trick over night.  They are soft enough, and just work great. Pampers sport their signature Sesame Street characters which my kids love.",5
"There really are not a lot of things to distinguish diapers from other brands.  In newborns there are different ways that they cut out for the umbilical cord.  And some have stripes that show if the diaper is wet.  But above newborns, they are all pretty much the same.These do not leak (the most important task), the elastic seems to be comfortable, yet secure.  I would give them five stars if they still had the wetness stripe.  I know when they are old enough to need 1s, for the most part you are pretty clear if a diaper is wet or not.  But I would still like the stripe for at least the size 1s.These are also a very good deal with the subscribe and save from Amazon.",4
"Pampers diapers are reliable and comfortable for babies. As always, they provide dryness and protection from rashes due to moisture and chaffing. The packaging is sensible, and the product has never let us down.",5
"To be honest, I am a bit conflicted about using Pampers Diapers. On one hand, I definitely think Pampers are a better product. On the other hand, it is hard to tell if they are really so much better than other diapers to justify the extra cost.On the positive side, Pampers Baby Dry Diapers have a soft, cottony feel. The diapers also seem to be well-constructed, as there are far fewer ripped tabs. The elastic seems snug around my child's thighs without leaving marks or irritation. They are not bulky, and it is easy to tell the difference between wet and dry diapers. We have not experienced any leaks since switching to Pampers, even with soaked overnight diapers.On the negative side, the Pampers Diapers seem to be more heavily perfumed than other diapers we have used. It doesn't seem to bother my youngest's sensitive skin at all, but my wife is not crazy about the over-abundance of baby powder scent. Also, Pampers are definitely more expensive even when compared to other big-name brands.Pampers Baby Dry Diapers do what they are supposed to do. They are well-constructed and absorbent. Whether or not they are worth the expense depends on personal preference and budget.",4
"We like Pampers diapers the best and these are no exception. My son is 12 months old and wears size 4 and they are a great fit. They fit close to the body and are nice and high in the back. We have never had any redness or rashes with these, and they perform pretty well overnight, with the exception of a few overnight leaks a month.",5
"We tried a bunch of different kinds and here is what we've discovered so far.The best diaper from birth to when our baby boy started crawling, is Pampers ""baby dry."" It is super absorbent and actually lasts overnight without leaking most nights.When he got a rash we would switch to cloth or to an unbleached disposable. That usually did the trick.But... once our boy started crawling, the poo would shoot up the back nearly every time. He needed something with gathers in back. For this we preferred the Huggies. I'd heard that huggies was better for boys, and I think it has something to do with the way the gathers work and the configuration of the padding in front. But my guess is that the huggies-for-boys thing isn't really relevant until they start to crawl.",5
"I'm really not thrilled with the fact that Pampers keeps decreasing the number of diapers you get in a box for the same price. As someone who budgets how often to purchase diapers it's highly annoying to have to keep reconfiguring my purchase pattern.As for the diapers themselves, they're not my favorite Pampers. There's nothing awful about them, we just prefer the swaddlers and cruisers. Every baby is different but for us there are definitely better options out there. Because of the shady downsizing I'm currently exploring other brands and will not be buying these again.",3
"Those of us with infants and toddlers are constantly on the lookout for the next best thing when it comes to diapers, and Pampers, Huggies, and Luvs are always coming up with supposedly better products.  Are Pampers Baby Dry diapers some of those better products?  Yes.UNBOXING:The Pampers Baby Dry 222 count pack is a large box of diapers, bigger than any of the ones I've seen in the store.  It measures # X # X #"", and weighs several pounds.  Amazon shipped the box of diapers in a larger unmarked brown box.  I think this was unnecessary, but it may have limited damage to the diapers during shipping.  The diapers are also divided into 3 plastic bags of 74 diapers, so you don't have to open them all at once (weird aside: are they preserving diaper freshness?).REVIEW:Well, we've been through half of the 222 diapers since receiving them, and I have to say, I'm mostly impressed.  I have only cleaned up 2 or 3 blowouts that I'm sure no other brand of diaper could have protected me from.  Other than that the only accidents I've had are overnight leaks.  Now, most diaper companies have made special night-time diapers that are more absorbent (less mobile cut), but Baby Dry diapers don't claim to be one of these.  For the most part, we've used the Baby Dry diapers throughout the day with no issues.  During night usage, however, it seems that if you have a belly-sleeper, this diaper will leak every time.  Once the front absorbent material gets wet, the liquid waste is no longer absorbed.  When the baby is on their back, the waste is directed into the rear of the diaper where it's absorbed.  However, if the baby is on their front, the waste leaks out the waistband or leg holes.  I'm not sure other diapers protect against this type of leakage, but Baby Dry do not.OVERALL:If you're planning on using Baby Dry during the day, it works really well to keep your baby dry without leaks.  Likewise, I've never seen any absorbent material on my kiddo's skin (I have with other brands).  As long as you're aware that these are NOT night-time diapers, and you take risks accordingly, then this is a really good diaper: lightweight, mobile, absorbent.  However, I think Pampers could have put more absorbent material in the front of the diaper--that would've earned 5 stars.  I recommend these diapers!",4
"I received these in size 2, and realized it would not have been a good investment. Even though they really are thicker than regular Pampers, and will hold more stuff inside, they are just too large to fit comfortably with my baby's cloths. And given that the regular Pampers will hold sometime for many hours, it's not necessary for this size.However as my daughter ages, I might take a second look at these.",4
"There's no beating the quality of Pampers diapers.Thin, extremely absorbent, secure, durable and with lovable Sesame Street characters to boot...I can't think of any complaints really. Price, I suppose, is the biggest drawback here. Especially for a huge box like this one. The most consistent complaint I have with diapers - and we've used many - are leaks, but that rarely (if ever) happens with Pampers.",4
"We no longer buy Baby Dry in favor of the cheaper brands, but if you can buy them on sale, they're great. They fit well and hold in a lot - great for overnight.",4
I've been very happy with these diapers. I have not had any bad experiences with them. They're great for overnight.,4
"We didn't realize these diapers were scented or we wouldn't have ordered them.  Our babies are exposed to enough chemicals and toxins that we aren't in control of; they don't need to literally be sitting in them all day and night as well.That alone would keep us from using Pampers again.Also, the texture of the diapers is odd and has an unpleasant plastic kind of feel (like the cheap grocery bag kind of plastic feeling).  Absorbency is adequate but not great.",2
"Durable, holds up very well at night. Minimal leaks.  I have used this brand on both of my children and have been satisfied.",5
"Finally, one diaper that has not given me ANY leaks!! I have a baby boy, 7 months now, and I hated huggies from the beginning because of the leaks. Funny how my mom in law said ""happened with my son 30 years ago just the same! try luvs"", and my mom said ""happened with your brother 20 years ago! try pampers"". Luvs was fine, I didn't have major issues with it in size 2. I was also using Babyganics for the day, which did leak a few times. Then I tried pampers baby dry for the night, as my baby was sleeping longer stretches, and they worked great! Now I ran out of organic diapers and just bought more Pampers baby dry for the day too. I change him just as often, because he pees many more times during the day than at night, and I don't like the idea of the pee there for hours, but they do absorb it and take it away from his skin. I love them for that, and I love that not once we have had a leak with them. Im going to stick to them and stop trying. This is the diaper that works for us!",5
These diapers are amazing! I use them overnight for my son and for the most part there aren't any leaking issues.,5
"Diapers that arrive at my door? Yes please! Cheaper than getting them at the store? Even better! I am a pampers fan and have been since my oldest was born. They seem to fit better than other brands and I am amazed by how much they hold. There were a few mornings that I am positive other diapers would have burst!!! I am not a huge fan of the new designs on the front of the diapers (they show through some of my daughters bloomers more than the old designs), but its purely silly and has nothing to do with the quality of the product.FYI- swaddlers do not have pictures and do not show through bloomers, in case you need something for special occasions!",5
I've used these diapers with my 2.5 year old for the last few weeks. I've been really pleased that I haven't had a single leak during that time. They stood up to the overnight test (12 + hours) and I felt like I didn't have to change his diaper as frequently as I do when I buy the cheaper store brand diapers. The diapers felt soft to the touch and my son liked the characters on them. I've been very pleased with them so far.,5
"These diapers seem to be comfortable for our 2 month old daughter. No issues with leaks or diaper rash. We have used these and the Pampers sensitive skin version. These seem more absorbent and she typically won't wake up if she wets herself in these (not always the case with the others). These do not have the stripe that changes color when wet that the Sensitive Skin version do  - if they did, I'd give 5 stars.",4
"We've found that the Pampers Baby Dry diapers actually pull the moisture away from the skin which made a big difference in how often our daughter got diaper rash and it also decreases the amount of time that it takes a diaper rash to clear up if one does develop. Our daughter is currently 28 months old and is wearing the Huggies Little Movers Slip-Ons during the day because we are potty training but we are still using these at night, they don't leak and they don't give her a rash. Also, get them on subscribe & save here on Amazon and you will save even more off Amazon's already low prices...I don't know why anyone buys diapers anywhere else!",5
We prefer pampers and this allowed daddy to order some diapers ahead without having to run to the store.  Consider subscribe and save,5
I'm a big fan of Pampers. It's the one brand that I've been using consistently with 4 kids. My daughter is currently 23 months old and still not potty trained. There are times when hubby forgets to change her and with the old version there might be leakage. I've noticed that these are a bit more absorbent than the older version was. Now if you plan on potty training I would suggest getting a different brand that does leak. These are not going to help your cause. They are great for nighttime use and for long trips. Besides the absorbency I didn't really see much difference in the diapers. The fit is still great with the stretchy sides and velcro tabs. Love them and recommend them all the time!,5
"With three close in age, we have probably tried every type of diaper widely available. Pampers remain our favorite for a reason, and that is because they simply are the most absorbent and are also not irritating. While I wouldn't recommend leaving a diaper on a baby for 12 hours under most circumstances, I have no doubt that if any diaper is up to the task, this one is. It is very absorbent. My only complaint is that the cost is so high, and with reduction in the size of box, higher than it once was per count. For that reason, alas, my family usually has to choose a reliable store brand like Mother to Mother instead.",4
Great product for grandparents to have around the house during the holidays.  No leaking or issues with night time wear.  Recommend this product to new moms as well as grandparents.,5
"Previously a Pampers Swaddlers and Cruiser only, but decided to try the baby dry to save some $$ and they work just as good as the cruisers and swaddlers. NO leaks, and no skin reactions!I am baby dry only from now on, and my wallet is happy.",4
"We have been very pleased with Baby Dry diapers. On our older son we used a cheaper brand, but when we tried them for our new baby, his skin broke out. These have worked very well and did not irritate his sensitive skin. The only time we had leaks was when he was ready to move up a size.",5
"We moved to these from the swaddlers when our little one became larger. We never have leaks or blow-outs and she's one. The quality is good and have only ever had one diaper rash! I don't know if I can relate this all to the diapers exactly, because every babe is different, but we have had only a positive experience with these.",5
"Overall I like this diaper. It keeps my baby dry and absorb very well.When you open the box, the smell is too strong, but fades away with time.",4
I use this as my baby boys night diaper and it works great.  He doesn't wake up from a wet diaper and even holds in poop after 12 hours of a wet diaper.  I have been happy every time with this diaper.,4
"I don't think these stay quite as dry as Swaddlers - now that Swaddlers come in Size 5, I'll use them more.",4
Great diapers. I like how pampers fit and keep my daughter comfortable. Of course she likes the characters as well.,5
"Didn't see in the description that these diapers are scented. Not sure if it wasn't there or just not obvious enough, but either way this is not what we were looking for.",2
I have been a loyal pampers fan but thanks to the reduced number if diapers I will be switching to Huggies. Very disappointed.,2
"I would recommend this diapers to all moms, they are the best in quality! My kid wear them since he born.",5
"These diapers are great for my two year old daughter.  I used Huggies with my son but found that they had leaking problems with my daughter, so I switched to Pampers, and these have become my regular brand for her.  There are rarely leaks with these, even when they are quite full.  I do use an overnight diaper at night though, so I can't attest to how well these would work at night.  For daytime use though, they are perfect for my daughter.  She is small for her age, about 23 pounds, and they fit her nicely with some room to grow.  I highly recommend these diapers!",5
We bought these at the suggestion of a friend for night time. Our 10 month old baby normally sleeps we'll but would occasionally wake up during the night with a wet diaper.We'll these diapers suck. They leak even though they fit her snugly. Every night since purchasing them she has woken up around 1am soaking wet requiring a total change of clothes and bed sheets.The first night we thought it was a fluke but now we know these are just terribly designed. Save your money! We're going back to our Huggies pure and natural. Even if they aren't rated 12 hours they don't leak like the pampers piece of crap diapers do.,1
"I have 2 boys... Currently am expecting baby boy #3. That said, I have always loved huggies. However they are awful now since they remade them. As soon as my son will pee a little you can smell it immediately. It is terrible!!! Plus for poop it doesn't hold it in and hardly the same stretch as the same were 5 years ago.Kirkland brand is one of my favorite. But they are a puffier diaper. Not as soft as pampers. But stretch is great.Luvs is very comparable. But for my son, I didn't like at first because he has a big tummy and they didn't cover how I liked. Also my son had a rash from them because of their pleasant scent. If your baby isn't so sensitive to smells, this is a good diaper. Poops not so well held in. But an ok day time diaper.Honest company. Great leakage protection. But you cannot get a good hold on the stickies to over lap. So I was never able to make them right enough to work well enough. I may try them again with my next baby when he is small infant. All above but Kirkland Definitely not a good toddler diaper for the fact that they are NOT good for walkers and the front falls down. Which results in more waste and more money spent.That said... My NEW favorite diapers are now PAMPERS and PAMPERS CRUISERS along with PAMPERS OVER NIGHTS.So pampers baby dry. Very good diapers. Slightly large then the cruisers. Smell is nice. Doesn't cause rash. Locks in pee for a long time. My toddler who is almost 2 has had a bad bug for the past week. Making diarrhea ever 30 min. NOT ONE LEAK in a pamper diaper!!! I swear by these. The cruisers I like because of walking and not sliding down. Last night I had to quickly run to Walmart because of his runny poops at grandmas opening Xmas presents. I ran out of the cruisers in my diaper bag. So I bought a box of these. They are about $43 at our Walmart. Very expensive. I have never spent so much. I can say he wore this diaper brand after sleeping all night no leaks at all. With the cruisers I have to change him in the middle of the night. Which is fine with us because he drinks a ton of liquids throughout the day. These diapers actually hold in liquids better.I am reading A lot of reviews that quality is lower and they are not soft? I can easily say. These are the softest diapers I have used. I really like these. Both Me and a friend with another boy switched to pampers completely now. I was shocked they are as good as they are being as thin as they are. I like them and will stick with pampers for when my next baby is older.The only slight drawback is the price. I wish they were slightly cheaper. But because I can see I won't be going through as many of them as I has with other brands it may work better... I like these better then the cruisers even now. Glad I tried them. I got several boxes at the local Safeway for 50% off on clearance (cruisers) which is why I tried them. Glad I did. Wish I bought more. Price wise, I think safeway is the cheapest because of their added coupons you can use with extra savings to sometimes amount in $10+++Another thing I am hoping they change or help with when it comes to smaller sizes. I breastfeed my boys. Which results in several runny watery poops a day. MY experience in the past was the poop running out the backs of the diapers because there is no stretchy band to hold that part closer to them. Hmm. Maybe they have them now with the swaddlers. I'll definitely try them. I'm very confident I'll be switching regardless after baby is eatting regular solids though being the great results I have with my toddler.",4
This one is better than huggies or costco's kirkland diapers. The diaper Holds through the night without any leaks or wetness.,5
Ok but not great i guess there is no perfect product. I tried huggies both works and leaks as well. I just go with the price.,4
I have always preferred Pampers over other diapers for my daughter. They are just awesome. My 20 month old daughter has used them since birth. Thanks to Amazon Mom for the discounts and free shipping!,5
"The perforation sticker on the corners of diaper are not strong enough to hold the diaper in place and often come off. As a result there are innumerable diaper leaks. It does not work as promised to provide overnight protection. In the new improved version of Pampers baby dry diapers, the number of diapers per pack have been reduced but the price has been increased. The quality has also deteriorated compared to the older version,The inner layer of diaper seems very thin and so does not absorb maximum leakage.I would not recommend this product to anyone.",1
"I've been using these as overnight diapers on my son over the past few weeks.  In size 2 at 16 pounds, he hasn't leaked through any of the dozen or so Baby Dry diapers he's worn so far.  I don't think he's a difficult overnighter, but he will overfill the local grocery store brand, and I certainly will pay more per diaper to not have to use another diaper at 2am and have to wake myself that much more.Most negative reviews of these are about a recent increase in price.  I'm reviewing just based on this being a quality diaper that lasts 12+ hours as promised.",5
"My family loves Pampers! We have tried out all the major brands and found that these are the best at keeping everything in where it needs to stay and baby's skin rash free. My child does occasionally still get a rash, but not nearly as often as she has wih other brands.For young infants who almost constantly have a wet diaper, I would recommend Pampers Super Sensitive diapers instead, but these are great for older kids.The new design has been much better in regards to absorption, making me love Pampers even more. My only complaint is that occasionally my daughter will wake up wih a leak, but that is only with an extremely full overnight diaper.I have had a couple of diaper tabs rip off, but the company was quick to send me a $10 off coupon when I informed them. They were very helpful! Thank you Pampers for wonderful products!",4
You really can go 12 hours!! Now do you really want to have your baby sit in a diaper for 12 hours?? NO...probably not. But if you were forced and had to you could. But point being you can definitely keep this on them during the night and not have to wake them for the night time changing that is sure to interrupt their sleep. Love these. Definitely use them every night!,5
From day one our son has been using Pampers Swaddlers. Once he went into size 4 we changed our subscribe and save to Baby dry. Worst mistake ever!!!! First day he had a rash all the way around from his stomach to his back.  Sorry to say but we will not be using Pampers anymore.,1
"We all have our diaper preferences, and when you have Amazon Mom plus Subscribe N Save, the price is amazing.  I always liked the Pampers Baby Dry - they are generally thin, and hold up well at nighttime.  Further, they are easy to fasten and hold everything in.  Will buy again - even when I am a second-time mom.",5
My kids always use this kind of diapers. Work good for us and they last longer that other brands plus better to buy a big pack.,5
These pampers baby dry diapers fit our don are the most comfortable. They hold slot and have simply always worked work for us.,5
Love pampers. My son has been wearing them since he was born & now he is 15 months. Very satisfied,5
Pampers have been great. They have not leaked on us yet and seem to fit comfortably on our little girl.,5
"Why, or why do Pampers people insist of adding the annoying baby powder smell. I like these best of the all the Pampers lines, for their slimmer fit and minimal designs, but have recently tried Babyganics and like them much better. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't carry them, but they are only 4 cents more per diaper compared to the subscription price and just 1.5 cents compared to the regular price at Baby'R'Us ($20 for a box of 92). Not sure I'm ready to experiment with a new vendor, but I do like those diapers :)",4
"Got these at a decent price. My son gets diaper rash very easily from many brands of diapers (even ones made for sensitive skin).  These keep him rash free. Also they are a great overnight diaper, they may be very heavy and triple their size in the morning but the pjs and crib have stayed dry all night.",5
"After graduating from Swaddlers, we needed a great diaper. Both my kids had terrible skin reactions to the dreadful other major diaper line from this company. These are great. And people, don't actually leave your child in this diaper for 12 hours unless it's overnight. I've read haunting negative reviews where the patent complained that they don't really stay leak free-if your child is a toddler, they are probably going to ""go"" more often during the day. We've had less than a dozen soak througs in the four years we've used these, so I am very satisfied. We used these for our everyday and nighttime diapers.",5
I  changed diapers level 1 to level 2 just  before I ordered this diaper to make my baby feel more comfortable even though level 1 wasn't that so tight. The previous diaper was also pampers dry level2 and it was big enough for my baby and he was happy with that.But this pampers baby dry level 2 looks different from previous one and weigh smaller than that.  I have used them very unsatisfied  with the size. Actually I found it is even smaller than level 1 diaper that I had used.,1
"We're a fairly brand-agnostic family when it comes to diapers. We take what's on sale, what's given to us, as long as it doesn't break the babies out or leak all over the place, then we're good. We've used Pampers Baby Dry in the past and had no real complaints with them. They didn't break the babies out (3 of them over the past three years or so thanks to my 21 month old twins) and didn't leak any more or less than any other brand (and usually that was due to shifting rather than the Pampers not being absorbent enough). They were fine diapers.To be absolutely honest, they're still not terrible, although I don't see any huge ""improvements"" despite the advertising to the contrary. They don't seem quite as soft and the tape is a bit different (and more prone to not sticking), but overall they still do a pretty good job not leaking and they haven't broken my daughters out at all. The fact that there are less diapers to a box with a price drop just seems to indicate that any actual ""improvements"" made in the diapers were done to improve Pampers' bottom line (no pun intended). I see Pampers responding that the changes were made to ""better meet parents wishes,"" but the reality is something else entirely (as evidenced by recent review scores). Pampers Baby Dry didn't need fixing, especially when all the ""improvements"" seem like a step backward for the parents buying them.",3
"My family prefers Pampers diapers over most others because they are by far the softest. I might not have wanted to purchase the most expensive diapers (like Pampers and Huggies) but we ended up getting some freebies at the hospital after all three of my kids were born. So it's been obvious from the start, Pampers are the softest and most gentle as far as texture and comfort go.They hold in a lot of moisture and leaks will always happen from time to time, but Pampers seem to be more secure than some other cheaper brands. Our second choice is Luvs, my husband and I can't stand Huggies. We will buy generic store brand diapers over Huggies. But if budget was never a factor and we could chose our favorite every time, it'd be Pampers. This economy pack size is great, too. We find that they're almost just as cheap when ordered with Amazon Prime.",5
"At first I didn't notice anything too bad about these diapers, aside from the tabs leaving red marks. After using them for a few weeks though, I noticed my baby was developing a slight redness on her legs where the diapers sits. But the worst part is that the tabs left SCRATCHES on her skin! At first I didn't know if it was caused by the diapers but after it happened again, I knew there could be no other cause.",1
"I realize the Baby Dry diapers are more ""economical"" than the Swaddlers, so I don't have such high expectations.  There are more diapers in a box, which is great, but I know there is a trade-off.It seems that the these are a little stiffer than the Swaddlers diapers, and they have a more ""diaper-y"" smell.  (We generally use the Swaddlers Sensitive, so don't deal with too much ""new diaper"" smell...though ""new diaper"" smell is certainly better than ""used diaper"" smell!)Because these diapers seem rougher/stiffer, we don't use them when the little one has any sort of diaper rash.  (That seems cruel.)  But otherwise, these diapers seem to work pretty well.  The Swaddlers are still our first choice, but these are okay too.",4
"I opened the box two days ago and the first diaper I put on my son was for overnight.  When we got up in the morning, the entire inside of the diaper (gel) had exploded onto his skin.  Okay, I thought..maybe he peed a lot (though, we NEVER had this problem with Huggies and what a coincidence that the night I switched was the night he peed too much for a diaper...hmm...).  Then I put another one on in the morning and within a few hours, again, it exploded.  Either I've got a defective box or something is wrong with these diapers.I'm going back to Huggies...",1
The shape of these is rather square which - for my chubby babies - doesn't work out as well as more contoured diapers.  It creates gaps at the back and tops of legs which result in some really bad messes.  They're also heavily scented with a floral powdery scent that seems to persist no matter how long they've been opened (we keep our diapers in an open basket).  On the plus side they are extremely thin which is sort of nice when you're dressing baby in layers during colder weather but they're also sort of stiff.,3
"All diapers are getting expensive, unfortunately. Such is the economy, everything is going up,  but when you need them, you need them. You might as well get them here at Amazon instead of lugging them from the store. Amazon's price qualifies you for free shipping and the item is sold at a fair price. You do pay for the Pamper name, but you get a superior product. No leaks, really. They do well overnight. They are a bit bulkier than other brands in the middle, but that is probably why there are no leaks.The tabs stay put, and do not come unglued. This is a size 2, not infant size, so it gets plenty of motion activity.  No leaks are important to us in our household and in our automobiles. If quality is important to you, I think you will be satisfied with this brand and I don't hesitate to recommend these to you.",4
"I am happy enough with this product, I am using it with my second son. I am LOYAL to the brand. too afraid to try anything else.",5
"These seem like a good way to keep a baby dry longer. I didn't think about the sizes when I ordered these. The baby I bought them for is premature, so it will be a little bit before she can try them out. They would swallow her! They are soft though and appear to be exactly as described on the box.",5
The tabs on these diapers are not as easy to open as other pampers and can rip easily if you are not careful.  There just isn't enough material to pull up on when you are putting new diaper on.  They do keep the baby dry though.,3
I have these sent automatically every month. They are always one time and the best!I recommend pampers to everyone,5
"I've used Pampers with my boys since they were born. We've had a standing ""subscribe and save"" for Pampers for over two years (we have a 1 and 3 year old). The bottom line is that no other diapers work as well as Pampers. The negative reviews don't make any sense to me as we've NEVER had a problem with ANY Pampers product.These Baby Dry Size 4 diapers are no exception. They're as good as always and we have no problems whatsoever with leaking, stuffing coming loose, or anything else that the negative reviews talk about.I'm happy to recommend these diapers. 5 Stars.",5
These diapers tend to leak a lot and filling comes out. I have not repurchased and have switched brands now.,2
"Price increase doesn't bother me too much, as these diapers work much better than loves or regular Huggies.  I do like overnight Huggies the best.",4
These diapers are worth the extra money. They are great for overnight and long car rides. It is amazing how much these diapers can absorb. No more leaks overnight!,5
"first time that my 4 month old baby has ever had a reaction to her nappies, and it was the same day I switched to these from Pampers swaddlers. I assumed they would be the same quality - WRONG on all counts.These nappies also seem smaller than the Swaddlers size 2.Now I am lumbered with a bumper size box of nappies I can't use, am going to see if Amazon will take them back.",1
When our daughter reached 6 months - we used a box of this per month and they worked really well.,5
"Not as good as Pampers Swaddlers, but certainly less expensive.  They work well enough.  I would put them on par with generic store diapers (like Target), which I try to transition my kids to when they are done with size 2 Swaddlers in order to capture a bit of savings...",3
Excellent! Our grandson was a month early but mom and dad have been feeding him well and now he's over 8 lbs. He just now fits into the size 1 diaper. These really do help keep him dry for a long period. It was kind of hard to tell  if he actually had wet them. Great pack as we know we'll need them.,5
"Unfortunately, the amount for the risen price is getting a little ridiculous.  I have not seen a change in quality.  There does not seem to be a difference between the old Pampers and the new pampers for this type.  The swaddlers I definitely see a difference in the amount of absorption and they seem to be getting smaller.  The Baby Dry is still working for me.  I haven't seen much of a difference in the amount of times that I am changing my child, but I am seeing a difference in how many times I need a new box.  Where I was going through about a box every three weeks to a month, it's now down to about a box every two weeks.  Yep!  That's right, I'm getting about half as much as I used to and paying just a little bit more.  That's just not acceptable.",2
"When you are looking for the best brand of diapers for you babies, look no further than Pampers. Yes, they are more pricey that the generic brands, but it's going to be once in a blue moon when one of these has any sort of failure. They are made from the best materials and are very reliable. I guess that's why they are the most trusted brand of diapers you can buy! Seriously, we've tried all sorts of brands, and these DO actually work the best - whether you're talking about leakage prevention, fasteners, absorbancy, smell reduction, or whatever sort of diaper functionality you can think of. These are the king of the diaper world!",5
Nothing really beats the price. I love it. Free shipping and always arrived in time. It pampers so when it comes to dryness it's unbeatable for me. I will definitely recommend it to a friend.,5
"We were new to the diaper world and we thought that all diapers were the same...bad mistake. Soon enough we found that investing in good quality diapers will save you a lot of trouble. We tried some store brands to save money but we ended up having way too many ""messes"".Pampers has proven to be THE best of all. They truly hold double what the others do, the pull the moisture away from the baby and will not fall apart overnight as other cheap brands.",5
"I LOVE THESE DIAPERS! i have used 2 different types of huggies. target brand diapers, babiesrus brand diapers and luvs. To be honest they all work for basic needs. Im a single mom of 3 girls so there were times i couldn't afford pampers or huggies and the other brands i listed all did their jobs. However you can't get the softness pampers offers from any of those other brands. Its also a lot easier to tell when my daughter has a wet diaper when she wears the pampers. Pampers and Huggies are both great brands but when it comes to comfort I feel Pampers wins. My 3rd daughter also has sensitive skin and gets eczema and rashes very easily. She doesn't have any problems with pampers or huggies but again I'm sure having a very soft diaper on rashy skin covered in different creams and vasoline sure feels a lot better. The pampers also have very stretchy tabs so that helps big time with multiple diaper changes when my daughter has her typical tummy issues. I use the huggies natural care wipes with these pamper diapers and i could not be any happier. pampers wins in diapers and huggies wins in wipes! happy baby=happy mommy",5
Used to love pampers baby dry and then they recently repackaged them. They have already leaked three times on us in 1 wk. Not too impressed. Going to try a generic diaper.,2
"I've tried several of the Pampers brand diaper styles since my daughter outgrew the Swaddlers, which we loved for their absorbency, softness, and ""pee"" indicator. I was disappointed with the Cruisers style and am even more disappointed with these Baby Dry ones. These feel so thin and the outer material is papery and cheap, the quality I'd expect from a store brand diaper, not Pampers. I surprisingly haven't had any leaks with these, which is why it even gets 2 stars, considering the fit is terrible and just like the Cruisers I tried, they are long in the crotch and have to be hiked up pretty high on my daughter's stomach and back or they'll bulge in the back and make gaps for blowouts, making them uncomfortable for her since she tries to pull it down.Pampers has lost a loyal customer because of their low quality diapers with expensive price tags.",2
Our newest baby in the family has used all the top brands of diapers. In this economy it comes down to the best value. These are what we call the top of the line. They keep the baby's skin dry we have not tested 12 hours as she does not sleep 12 hours at a time yet. The tabs stay in place and the seasame street characters are cute.The best part NO leaks. No rashes. Highly recommend never has a problem with Pampers. We have used them since they first came out and I was a babysitter.,5
My wife like this product very much and as described it will absorb all the urine and it wont split outside.,4
wow this is so much more than i expected. I love the large amount that comes in this one. keeps baby dry for hours. so cute the design too. LOVE it .highly recommend to all well worth the price,5
"I have to admit I am a bit of a Pampers fan.  They are the only diaper brand I ever used with my daughter and she is using them with my grandson.I was happy to receive these special Sesame Street ones.  I know Caden doesn't realize he is getting styled with Sesame Street but they make me smile!The absorbency of these diapers is amazing.  The fit is very flexible.  Although they aren't the swaddler kind, they are super soft to me.I definitely would recommend these to any parent or grandparent.",5
"So I am a well meaning aunt who got these for my sisters new baby and didn't pay any attention to sizing. Oops! Size 4 is a bit big for a newborn, so I obviously can't review the fit. But out of curiosity to see how dry the diaper would stay over night we poured more water than we thought the baby could pee into this, sealed it tight, and rolled it around in a blanky. It stayed pretty dry though I know this isn't an exact scientific method. I think my sisters just looking forward to the baby sleeping all night so if these diapers can eventually help her stay a bit sane because he sleeps so she sleeps then I will feel like a good Aunt even if I know nothing about diaper sizing. I figure if you are going to gift someone diapers, giving them the added gift of an uninterrupted night of sleep makes the present better.",4
"Better than most brands at containing a ""blow out"" (poop till shoulders), but sometimes lets loose.  Overall pretty good for a name brand for the price.",4
"No, they aren't all the same.I find these actually fit better (for my kid, not me, wiseguy!).  The fasteners seem more durable.  I've used off-brand/warehouse club-brand diapers in the past and have had the fastener tab tear right off as I was changing the kid.  These are more sturdy.  The fit around the legs also seems better.  Finally, maybe it's me, but the actual material seems softer than the off-brands.I guess I'd say I view these as the standard - they fit well, absorb well, and are decently made.  Not much more you can ask of a diaper, yet finding some that deliver is harder than I thought it'd be.  This is a good product.",5
It does what it says on the box. To make the price better I would use subscribe and save for it. The reason for 4 stars is because I think that there a products just as good out there that are cheaper. If you love your pampers tho this is the one to get,4
"These diapers keep our son dry for a long time, and fit him well.  We have had no trouble with leaks.  The cost is very reasonable, lower than in local stores.  We plan to purchase these again in the future.",5
"P&G; made a mistake by lowering the count per box (without lowering the price).  I gave Huggies a try (Kimberly Clark) and they work just as well for a lower cost.PG and Pampers loss is Kimberly Clark and Huggies gain.Pampers claims to have a more absorbent diaper, but I noticed no difference other than an increased cost.",1
"A newborn needs a diaper change around a dozen times a day, so this box of Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Size 1 Economy Pack Plus 252 Count will hopefully last around 3 weeks.  Funny, but I have no memory of washing and drying my daughter's diapers when she was a baby, but I only used Pampers for emergencies or when we were out and about.  These diapers are not at all like what I remember and it certainly doesn't resemble the diaper that's still on my daughter's cabbage patch kid (premie as was she).  Nevertheless, they absorb and contain, and if you seal them properly on your infant, they should work well.  I'm not sure about how they function on a larger baby, but these are just fine and only a step below the swaddlers also manufactured by Pampers.  Guess we'll eventually try them all.  Incidentally, we have yet to see any beads form from the gel that the website describes and we're happy about that.",4
"These are great diapers. We usually use cloth for our little man, but prefer disposables when we are on the go or when he is in a childcare setting. These are trim, but still fit around his chunky thighs. We haven't had any leak issues. These are by far the best disposables we have used.",5
"Cheap and better than the rest. Love it. Since the birth of my baby, I have been using this and had no issues so far.",5
"I have twin 13 month olds. We have tried a store brand, Huggies, and Pampers. Pampers seemed to be the only ones that don't leak.  We have used the swaddlers and baby dry and use them both. Pampers will be the only ones we ever buy. It's not to say diapers don't leak, it's inevitable but with the Pampers it's rare.",4
"We are using Pampers brand diapers on child number five. We tried out various brands with our oldest a few years ago and none of the other brands were in the same league. We have since then only used Pampers because they are incomparable. Perfect absorbency, always comfortable. On occasion, we've tried other brands (when we needed one in friends homes etc) and I have always stuck with Pampers.Thank you.",5
"I am truly disappointed with this new and improved version of Pampers.  I was a Pampers fan with my first son 20 years ago so I decided to stick to what was best with child #2.  Sad to say there are more problems than not with this brand.  The quality has definately decreased to an extent that leaks happen daily, tape doesn't stay in place, they now come less to a package and worst of all they just do not fit baby right.  I made the switch to Huggies (which I disliked 20 years ago), and I am totally satisfied with this brand and am now a Huggies fan.  Sorry Pampers,  corporate greed has overrun your company and its no longer about what is best for baby but has become for you the cheapest to manufacture.",1
"After reading all these negative reviews I decided to give a new box a try as I was using Pampers for quite awhile and was happy with it. Ok, the diapers (Size 3) are a bit lighter and do not have an odor, which is a good thing. As far as leaking, my 7 m.o. son doesn't like wet diapers, once he pees for couple times he is showing he needs to be changed. So previously we have not really been using a diaper for more than 3-4 hours at a time. However, last couple nights he started sleeping longer than usual throughout the night, and he got wet after 6 hours of sleep, the diaper leaked :-( I am not sure what happened, maybe my husband did not tie it good enough. I will use it a bit more to see how it goes. If it will happen again, I will have to switch to different diapers...P.S. I never had problems with previous version of Diapers with my older daughter.I am making an UPDATE to my original post from Nov 26, 2013. It's been a month as we use a new box. Unfortunately this diapers LEAK!...The absorbency does not hold wet more than 4 hours. So disappointing, I loved Pampers Baby Dry. Please bring them back!! :(",2
I buy these diapers because they are the only brand that do not leak on my heavy wetting 6 month old. We have had a few blow outs but worth not having to change at night.,5
"I loved these diapers until pampers changed the design. They said they didn't but the did. They smell different, the absorbency is not as good, and we have had poop blow outs with these new ones. We never had that problem with the older design.  Not only that  now my daughter gets rashes, where again before the change the old version pampers never did.  I'm moving on to another brand.",1
"Pampers is the best for my son. Sometimes when he has a full diaper I find little clear beads. The beads haven't reacted with his skin, so I continue to use them.",5
"We have been purchasing Baby Dry diapers since our daughter has been born, shes about 17 months now.  The ""baby dry"" series have been reliable and comfortable for her and we are very happy with the Pampers brand.  They may be a little more expensive than cheaper brands but they DO offer the protection new parents want for a baby who likes to sleep.  Our toddler regularly sleeps for 11-12 hours a night and having a diaper that is both absorbant and comfortable for her is very important.  Nothing is worse than having to ""wake"" a sleeping baby in the middle of the night because her diaper leaked or she is soaked through to her skin.  This rocks both for baby and for parents.",5
"We've used Pampers exclusively since my son was born 13 months ago. All of a sudden the diapers have started leaking almost every other night, and by leaking I mean totally soaked through, right to the bed, with my poor baby's pjs soaking wet. We thought we were doing something wrong or had the wrong size although we have been doing nothing different so we tried different things...still leaking. I'm very fed-up with this situation since my son doesn't get a good night of sleep and that means I don't either. We will not be buying Pampers any more.",2
"I love love LOVE Pampers. My son leaks out of every other kind of diaper. I know different kinds of diapers fit other babies differently, but Pampers is the only way to go for us. I have friends who feel like the thin design of Pampers means they aren't absorbent, but I find this totally untrue. They have been most absorbent for my kids (girls and boys) for the longest amount of time and I love the thinness of the diaper. I can fit way more into my bag and don't feel like my kids are wearing bulky cloth diapers. I love Pampers and would recommend that everyone give them a try.",5
"My experience with Amazon Prime and this merchant, the merchandise, quality, competitive price and being shipped on  time in the two day as promised has been outstanding and for me and my houshold is greater than the 5 stars.....to me it deserves 10 stars **********",5
Box has 1dozen less diapers.Quality is now same as store brand ... Feels paper like... Less absorbable material.:(,1
It does not help during night time. my baby still soaks it and we have to change him twice at night.,1
This is my #1 choice for diapers.  I have little to no leaks w/my 6 month old.  The wetness indicator is key!,5
We've been gifting Pampers to our children for our grandchildren for years.  I used Pampers 37 years ago for my kids and never had leakage!,5
"I really wish I could give the new and ""improved"" Pampers negative-5 stars.  They claim in their responses to these reviews they've made them more absorbent, as if they've done us a favor.  ""More absorbent"" has been the absolute opposite of our experience over the past month or two.  The change in performance occurred exactly when the #6 size big box went from 140 to 128 diapers.  That first night that my 20 month old son slept in one he leaked, which is weird, because he'd leaked maybe twice in the preceding 20 months of Pampers use.  Since this change, he wakes up almost every morning with his belly soaked, and even after a 2 hour nap.  ""Cold!"" he says, picking at his shirt, when I get him up.  He has grown up in Pampers, but no more.  We actually had some of the previous version stashed in a bathroom drawer.  I gave him a bath last night and had forgotten to grab a diaper from his changing table, so I pulled one from the drawer.  I could tell immediately, just by its greater heft, that it was the older style.  Pampers has done a despicable disservice to its loyal customers, and I, for one parent, won't be buying any more.  Fortunately, he's close to training time, and we won't have to deal with any diapers for much longer.  And to whomever this Pampers rep is who's been responding to other improvement bashers on Amazon, don't even bother responding to this.  As I said, we're close to being out of diapers, anyway.  This is just a sad disappointment.  First, you get rid of the ""thick"" wipes in favor of the useless thin ones, now this.  I guess as long as you keep telling us you've improved your products, that should be enough.",1
"I have always used pampers for my 20 month toddler but the recent package I received is horrible. He has been getting rashes from the diaper. It might sound strange but fortunately my son has never ever got a diaper rash, not even once. All of a sudden the moment I started using the new package his tush is all sore. I wonder what happened to the quality or was it a bad batch. I want pampers or amazon to do something and all the parents please be careful. I will try to update the lot number as soon as I get it.I'm so upset!!!!",1
"This new version has been a big disappointment for us. Here are the changes I have observed since the revision of what used to be a very good diaper:-increased in cost per diaper (packages containing fewer diapers)-issues with the tape: we've had several cases where it rips off the material its stuck to on first use, leaving it not sticky enough to attach to anything, wasting an unused diaper.-flimsy: a few times the stretchy material has detached when pulling on the tape to snug it up, wasting an unused diaper.-price hikes that may be more related to Amazon or diapers.com issues.I read that there is now 20% more absorbency in the product, but unless you leave your kid to soak in a wet diaper for long periods of time (we don't), this tends not to be an issue in the first place. As far as ""new graphics"" being a feature, this is not something I would even be looking for in the first place... we would prefer the removal of low/no value features like this.Amazon noticably upped their prices for diapers about a year ago (maybe 15% or so) and now seem to be trying to push people off of Subscribe and Save deals into diapers.com subscriptions at a higher price again. With the new problems in the product itself and these recurring price hikes, the cost/benefit ratio has gone too far out of line for us so we are looking for alternatives.  Fortunately, we now have a Costco locally where we can compare several well-priced alternatives. Pampers should seriously consider reverting some of these new changes in an effort to retain their loyal customer base.",3
these diapers worked just like they said they would. the fit was fine & did not leak at all .good,4
"New version means less diapers that cause way more leaks.  Terrible.  Prior to the change, these were the best diapers I could find.  Now, I'm looking for something else.",2
I ordered this for a great grand child out of state.  Shipping was prompt and free.  I did not have to go to the store or the post office.,5
"We have used pampers exclusively. There was an occasional leak before - maybe once a week - but it got pretty frequent recently. I had to change my 18 month old 3 (THREE) times last night, poor kid was all wet. Every parent knows it sucks to change/dress a wet and sleepy toddler in the middle of the night, three times... So thank you for that Pampers!I will not be buying again unless it goes back to how it was before, quality and price-wise. I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 because this used to be a nice product and worked for us at the time. What a shame!",2
Best for use. I love it  I have twins and we have no problems with irritation. Easy to care with one hand.,5
"They are diapers, they do their job, no adverse skin reactions on my eczema diagnosed 2 year old. Good deal, good service. I'll buy these again, if they're the best deal on amazon for diapers at the time of purchase.  Its not a matter of loyalty to a diaper brand to prove to my kid that i love her, despite what the commercials suggest. I do love the giant useful box they come in and the way the diapers aren't all shrink wrapped in one lump but rather 3. The inner packaging makes for more efficient storage which strokes my raging OCD to manageable levels. I also like that my toddler cant rip them off. we've tried generic grocery brands and those are easily shredded by my 2 year old. I shorted this product a 5th star because I'm feeling stingy, and we had one over night leak.",4
"I've been a subscribe and save users on the baby dry ever since it became difficult to find the swaddlers in the size my son needs and they were always reliable, rarely leaked, and he seemed to tolerate them well. All of that is a thing of the past now that they've ""improved"" the diapers.My son has had recurring diaper rash problems now, including chafing where the leg elastic circles his thighs. The skins on one side was rubbed almost RAW in ONE day. And it's not just the leg elastic, he has had rash problems popping up all over. There is no doubt in my mind that it's the new diaper. There is nothing else it can be and the timing is just too ""coincidental"" for it not to be it anyway!These new diapers have also sprung leaks. The only issue with leaking that we used to have were long night sleeps when his diaper just became too full to take anymore (and those were night time diapers and not these anyway). Not anymore. Now he leaks during the day too.Lastly, as soon as I got the new diapers, I noticed that they have a peculiar crunchy feel to them now. I assumed it was whatever the ""new"" super absorbent material is inside the diaper. Whatever it is, I didn't feel great about having that crunchy, not-so-soft feeling next to my baby's bum. But I figured I'd give it a try.Well, after the horrible diaper rash; we're done trying. It looks like we'll be making the move to Huggies, Luvs, or Costco Diapers (although, tbh, I have heard that many babies have a hard time with the costco diapers too, so that's not exactly high on my list!).So disappointed. I can't image what the heck Pampers was thinking. It feels like a ""New Coke"" scenario all over again. Please give us back the old formula!!!",1
Good diapers.  The only con is that they are not very good for night time.  We have a toddler boy and he soaks through at night.,4
They work great. The diaper stay on tightly and held up for 5 weeks before I switched to the next diaper size. No complaints about this product.,4
These diapers are great. I have never have leaks or blowouts. My little one has never gotten diaper rash either.,5
"Does the job when your kid is all wetAnd diapers always cost money so prepare to get deeper in debtBut all in all, if you subscribeYou'll get a discount and that's without a bribeDiapers are pretty cheap on amazon, but you'll get a slightly more discount when subscribing.",4
"These are great. We tried every diaper and this is the only brand we had success with. I would have loved to use a more environmentally friendly diaper, but they scratch her inner thighs. One tip: get a size bigger if your baby still gets wet. If you haven't done it, sign up for Amazon's mom's club. It is a great deal if you are already a prime member. http://www.amazon.com/gp/mom/signup/info?ie=UTF8&refcust;=Q4R2BUOZOVYEUK4PX3EQIRP6PQ&ref;_type=generic",4
"I did not buy my baby dry size 4 on Amazon, but I want to comment on the quality of the product. Mu son has been in pampers brand since birth, and he rarely has a leak and has never had diaper rash. I did not care for Swaddlers, but that was my son, and it may be different for other babies. My son is 7 months old, 21 pounds and extremely active with crawling and walking along furniture. . I am going to try cruisers, just a small package, to see if it is worth ordering by subscription online.  I have tried free samples of Huggies and bought the  grocery store brands, and they were ok, but I would not buy large amounts of those brands. The place where I buy Pampers, the Huggies are the same count in a box for the same price for SIze 4 as Pampers, so I may as well stick to a product that I know is great. I also always have coupons for  Pampers which gives me $2.50 off each time.AS for the price and the downsizing of the packages, if you look in the grocery store for common brand name products, everything has gone UP in price and the size of the packaging has gone DOWN like a previous reviewer said. Pampers has their explanation for the smaller packages, so instead of blaming Pampers for this, please realize that this is happening everywhere and not just on one type and brand of product.",5
"We have been buying Pampers Diapers for the past couple of years and have been happy until the recent changes made. The diapers (new design) are considerably thinner than old design and also leak more. We used to have one or two diaper incidents (leaking) per week with the old diapers through out the past couple of years and now the incident rate has increased to one or two incidents per day (a whopping 500% increase rate of incidents). Our boy (2 yrs old) wakes up in the morning crying mostly because of the leaked diaper. I don't know how much of testing has gone into the new diaper design in order for Pampers to claim that they are better than previous design and ""offer up to 12 hours protection"" or ""outstanding leakage protection"".Also, I do not appreciate the fact that Pampers has reduced the quantity with the new design (down to 180 from 192). It not only costs us a little more but also not effective as before. Not a good steps forward. Sorry Pampers! We may need to start shopping for a better choice as we are expecting our second one shortly.",1
These are very absorbent.  Be aware that they run small.  Order a size up- especially for overnight use.  These are the only diapers we will use overnight.,4
I love pampers!  My favorite brand!  I rarely get leaks from them and they prevent rashes for my girls.  Other diapers do not keep them dry enough and will cause a rash and they leak.  I was using cruisers but got these since they were a little cheaper.  Still impressed as always!,5
"I've used Baby Dry for several months.  I started off with Swaddlers but had trouble finding them in size 5.  Baby Dry was a little thinner and not as soft feeling but worked OK at first. There became a consistent issue with the last few boxes.  Not all or even most but several diapers per box would unravel at the seem of the leg or the internal green layer!  My baby's leg would be green and the bead like urine contaminated inner stuffing would be all over him and his surroundings!  He was NOT in an excessively wet diaper.  I wrote to Pampers and they responded with several vouchers for $10.00 off but no explanation.  I was just worried about the dye and concerned he would put the stuffing in his mouth!  Because the issue occurred with multiple boxes, sent to me through Amazon in several different months I could not determine if it was a ""lot"" problem or if maybe my son was too active for Baby Dry.  I switched to CRUISERS and so far so good.  I have friends who use BABY DRY and have not had a problem with them.",3
We do not like how these have changed and have tried other diapers but had to come back to these because our son only wants the ones he recognizes. Hes been wearing Pampers since birth and we have been happy most of the time with them but this change and as well as a whole dozen less for the same price is upsetting. We will find something different for our baby due in March.,2
"My 5 month old was leaking through everything.  He sleeps 11 to 13 hours at night and hasn't leaked since I started using these.  I didn't like these 2 years ago with my oldest, but they now have a softer more cloth like feel to them, very similar to the cruisers for much less money.",5
"Please bring back the former version of these diapers, we liked those better!  These seem too bulky and aren't as fitted on her.",3
"I paid the same amount for a box of 216 diapers last month,  there is no way I would pay that amount for a box with almost 100 less diapers.  Switching to a different brand now!  Doesn't matter if this new kind absorbs more,  I didn't have problems with leaks before and I don't need to let my kids sit in diapers full of pee longer.",1
"First time my daughter used it, it leaked all over. I just thought I put it loosely. Second time she used it, it leaked again! No more orders!",1
Very nice compared to the previous make. It is more airy and comfortable for my 2nd kid. I love the new Sesame Street theme. He looks so cute in it.Also the last pampers we bought (for our first born) of the same size in 2010/11 had a more 'plasticky' smell but it is all gone now.Pampers hit the spot with this diaper!,5
"After receiving this new and improved pampers, I was really disappointed with the quality!  I've been using pampers for all of my babies and recommended pampers to all my friends/family. But after using this, I would have to cancel my subscription and tell my friends/family not to use it anymore.  I have to change my son's diaper every 2 hours because it does not have enough absorbent.  With the old version, I did not have to change his diaper so frequently.  I don't like the fact that I have to wake up throughout the night to change his diaper.  If not, it would leaked out and he have rashes.  Why can't Pampers keep things that are working and only change the product when it is not!!!",1
disappointed with the absorption compared to swaddlers. Not getting again.  Also wish they had the line to identify if a diaper is just wet.  These just seem all around to be pampers lowest quality and don't quite live up to their reputation in my opinion.,2
An excellent diaper for keeping the majority of #2's inside. 4 stars only because the Pampers swaddlers are even better.,4
"soft, good absorbancy, not leaked. Recommonded.only a small concern, pampers emailed saying $5 credited on this purchase but did not see on my account.",5
"We have been with Pampers since our daughter was an infant. I understand that you are getting less, but with prices going up the way they are, what else do you expect? We will continue with pampers.",4
"This is NOT an upgrade in any way.  This is an 8% increase in price (based on the reduced number of diapers per box) with no discernible improvement in the product whatsoever.  I used Pampers with my now 11 and 13 year-old children, and I have been using them for my baby since he was born 14 months ago.  I almost never experienced leaks with Pampers, which is why I always returned to this brand even after trying others briefly in hopes of saving money.  With this newest box of Pampers, my son now awakens every morning to soaked clothing and bed sheets.  I decided to size up from size 3 to size 4 to see if it would solve the leaking problem (even though he is well within the weight range for size 3), and he still woke up wet.  I wonder if they have changed the fit of the diaper, as the diaper now sags on him whenever it is wet.Pampers, why on earth did you have to change your diapers that were already the best out there?  If I am going to have leaks, I might as well save money and start buying generic diapers.  This redesign is about as good as the 1985 New Coke.",1
"These have poor absorbency, worse fit  and seem to have less scent containment (for #1) than Pampers Cruisers. Back to Cruisers.",1
"""...don't fix it.""The company line is that the recent quantity reduction without a linked price reduction is due to product improvements.  That may be so, but it isn't justified unless the improvement was necessary.  I don't see ""20% more absorbency"" as a selling point:  my daughter has put a lot into one of the previous-design diapers while almost never experiencing a leak.  The new texture is less plush; it feels more like plastic.Here is an interesting article regarding the recent change:  http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323864604579063310991786406  According to P&G;, the changes were made as a result of customer surveys, but survey results are only as good as question phrasing.  Was there a ""change nothing"" answer to the question?  Did the survey ask if you would be willing to pay 6% more per diaper for less leaking?""Latest and greatest"" is only a valid selling point in a select number of industries, and diapers isn't one of them.  So don't use it as an argument for a price increase.",1
"All diapers leak at some point, but this definitely leaks the least.  You do pay a little bit more for this brand, but I find it well worth the extra few cents per diaper.",4
"i rarely write reviews, however, i am confused on diaper size and different brands as a first time mom (even my baby is already 9 months old).  i'm now buying size 4, even my baby is a little bit below 20lb.  i started using pampers since baby is 1 day old, and it's the only brand i use so far. never tried huggies or store brands.size - luvs 4 and pampers dry 4 are the same size, but swaddlers 4 is a little bit bigger (i say 1/3 to 1/2 size bigger than luvs and pampers dry)constructions - luvs and pampers dry are 95% to 100% the same, except for the prints and colors.swaddlers has a mesh layer inside and the tabs are nicer built.  the mesh layer worked very well for the first few months when baby still had pretty liquid poop.  but it doesn't help too much once the poop has became more solid.softness/stiffness: swaddlers is soft.  luvs and pampers dry are stiffer and not as soft and feels 80% same, but my husband claimed that pampers dry is softer.price (size 4) - swaddler $0.32 each, pampers dry $0.26 each and luvs $0.22.absorbancy - all good. we tried all 3 brands overnight (8-10 hours), all no leaks. but luvs and pampers dry will come bigger (compared to swaddlers) after a big pee.  his/her bodysuit might get tighter.  but not much difference if changing diaper every 4 hours.conclusion: i would definitely get swaddlers for size 1 to 3, keep using it if money is not that big of issue for you.  but we switched to pamers dry or luvs once baby jumped to size 4. newborn babies are more sensitive, so i feel safer to get swaddlers for at least 3 months.  my baby does not have super sensitive skin, so we switched to luvs/pampers dry at size 4.  i also buy swaddlers just to use at night, since it's a bit bigger and softer.",5
"Love Pampers!! And the redesign is great :) I like how the diapers now have multiple characters on each diaper to avoid the ""I want the Elmo one"" argument!!",5
Great product!  Soft and very absorbable of overnight pees! The only brand we buy. Highly recommend this for baby boys,5
"great price no need to comment on quality this is ""pampers"" as many brands as i tried nothing compares to Pampers",5
Love pampers my son it 4yrs and daughter now 2months I will not use anything else and we did try other brands,5
"We've been loyal Pampers customers for the past twelve years.  Its the only brand I can use with my children and expect leak free performance all of the time. (We have had a few leaks on rare occasions but they're few and far between.)  Pampers Baby Dry are the diapers I tend to purchase most frequently because I feel they are the more economical option when compared to Pampers Swaddlers or Cruisers.  They cost less per diaper and you get more diapers per pack than you do with the premium Pampers lines of diapers.Pampers has made a few changes to the diapers recently that are worth noting.  The diapers seem thinner but, I have not had any issues with leakage.  They do seem to be just as absorbent as they were in the past.  The designs on the diapers have also changed which is something I'm not particularly thrilled about.  They used to be pretty plain with just the design on the velcro tab and a little picture somewhere else on the diaper but now they have designs that cover most of the diaper.  I much prefer the old diaper designs.",5
"I have liked Pampers diapers better than the other major brand. I have had very few ""blowouts"" with my child (who is petite). It seemed that my child leaked out of the other major brand almost everytime we used it. Pampers cruisers is no exception. It is good quality and have not had issues with leakage now that my child is mobile.",5
"We have been using these diapers for several years for both of our rather skinny and lean boys. Fortunately for us neither of them has had any sensitive skin issues or major blowout issues. In the five years we have been using the Baby Dry version I can count on  less than two hands the number of blowouts that escaped or overnight overfill issues that have leaked out.The only real change I have noticed over time is that the process of opening the diaper has gotten a bit more challenging. It used to be a one hand flip to separate the sides and go, not it requires a finger running under the flaps to get everything opened up. Probably an attempt to reduce packaging sizes they have compressed the diapers a bit more flat. But for the comfort they have provided my kids at a price that is reasonable it is a small problem to deal with.",5
Excellent product! Wish they didn't lower the number of diapers. Beats the competition hands down. Keep up the quality. Thanks.,5
"We have been getting these diapers for 2 years with Amazon and something has changed.  In the last 2 months Amazon let us know that they were being changed, which at the time only irritated me because the quantity went down.  I forgot about that because Amazon subscribe and save is so convenient.The bad part is now my day care has been asking why I changed because these are now leaking.  Leaking means I have to do more laundry, so now they are not convenient and they effectively raised the price with the upgrade.",2
I was expecting an improved and more absorbent diaper considering that the new boxes have fewer diapers. I was disappointed to find the fit off and that my 11 months old is experiencing leaks after naps and over night. I will definitely need to look into an alternative diaper for naps and  night.,1
Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus 180 Count ...always love it from size 0 to present.  recommended.,5
Meh...price increase!!... no difference in quality.  Time to look for something better or buy it for same price locally.  We have been using Pampers for over a year and a half.,1
"I have a 2 1/2 year old as well as a 1 year old and they have been in papers the entire time. Recently we noticed that they started to leak. We had several diapers ""explode"" where they lost their absorbing material. My oldest now can hardly make it through the night.Not only do we have fewer diapers but the quality dropped a lot. I now have two boxes I'm not sure what to do with. It's a shame because I loved the subscribe and save but I may have to switch to costco like others have suggested.",1
I wanted to love these diapers as I've used the Swaddlers since my baby girl was born almost 7 months ago. Now that she's a little older I wanted to dry a different diaper and one that is perhaps a little more economical so I decided on the Baby Dry because I love Pampers. Huge mistake! Since she's started on these diapers she's leaked through a poop (regular one not a big one that's hard to contain) soiling her new clothes and has woken up soaked two mornings in a row. This has been such a nuisance as I've had to change her sheets and mattress pad and put in the wash two days in a row (and I'm a working mom so time is inadequate to say the least). Guess I will have to return to Swaddlers or Cruisers (which are great) but now I'm stuck with an entire box of flimsy diapers and have to buy better ones for overnight. Very annoyed!,1
"Ok Pampers, the last few weeks my son has soaked his pjs and bedding because his diaper obviously didn't hold it all in.  I will wait to see if this 20% more absorbency will do exactly what it is intended to do and if it does then I will be justified with the reduction of diapers per box.  HOWEVER, if it doesn't you will lose me as a loyal customer.  I used Pampers with my daughter, whom is no longer in diapers and since my son was born, he is now 16 months old.",2
Many diaper brands are raising prices and reducing quantity.  Pampers has done it here.  I am not a happy customer and will look into a more economical diaper.,2
Recd the diapers in good condition. we ordered the diapers on my new baby boy's name.. we were really excited to see a item delivered on his name. It was fun :-)),5
"I see that people have really mixed reactions to these.In our experience, these are fine, no major problems. But they are not worth any more than a generic brand (such as LUVs or Target's Up & Up). They leak in the exact same spots, they are the exact same absorption and thickness, etc.We're going back to LUVs after we finish this box - they're less expensive for the same quality. If we had a major problem with leaks, we would probably go to Huggies or the higher end Pampers, but our little one rarely leaks more than a few drops so we're lucky not to require anything special.",3
"this device will hold urine and feces tighly to your baby's body until you are ready to tend to the mess and replace this undergarment/waste receptacle with a new one.  I highly recommend using this device, otherwise the baby will leave a mess wherever the baby is located at time of waste discharge.  Disclaimer: the baby picture on the sample box of diapers above is not my baby, I believe it is someone else's.",5
"I used to get 192 of these for about $45 and now I am paying about the same amount for 180. I know that's just how it goes sometimes, but it was very evident this time around. Gladly, potty training is in progress.I am sure the parents that had kids long before me where thrilled to probably get 214 diapers for $40 several years ago ;)Despite all of the picking...I still think these diapers are the best. Very few leaks ever,",4
"Maybe it's the weather, maybe it's teething, maybe it's just a change in my 7 month old's body chemistry, but ever since switching to these baby dry diapers, she has had near constant diaper rash.  The rash has varied from mild, to full on blisters.  We committed to using our supply up, but boy are we looking forward to going back to our old diapers.  I will update if their is no difference, which would indicate that the variable is my child, not the diaper itself, but my suspicions tell me that the correlation between increased diaper rash and the use of these diapers is strong.",2
"This is the brand and type of diaper that we have used for over a year. We are very disappointed that pampers has chosen to steal 18 diapers out of the package and charge the same price. There was no need to improve on a diaper that can keep a baby dry for twelve hours already. If you are not changing your baby's diaper more often than twelve hours, it is called neglect, not a leak. The ""improvement"" is a lame excuse to pick-pocket your customers because you think we are too stupid to notice. Shame on you! Bring back the old diaper or give us the extra 18 diapers for the same price.",2
"The new one is better, no question. It's thinner, lighter, and more absorbent. I have Amazon Mom membership, so I get 20% off on each month's subscription. This month they shipped two boxes to me, which has same 178 counts in each box, but they changed to the new version. I like how they treat customers, I don't care how they deal with the left-over old versions, at least they changed for me in the first time.They reduce numbers of diapers to 160 for size 5 now, but not a big deal. If you think few dollars difference can make you change pampers, which your kids started using since birth, to another brand, that's your own business, stop influencing other parents. I bought Huggies before because they are slightly cheaper, but I don't really like the quality and capacity. I can feel very wet on the surface of Huggies's diapers after my son pees, same as its pull-up brand, and very obviously the materials look cheap. I change Huggies's diapers more often than Pampers's. Pampers's diapers are much better in quality. Some kids, like my son, won't complain about the discomforting, but doesn't mean he can't feel it.I'm not a fan of pampers, I changed my newborn's diaper from pampers swaddler to another organic diaper, because he has very sensitive skin. He has rash when I put pampers swaddler on him, but it worked fine on my older son when he was small.",5
"These diapers have very strong chemical odor!! They smell like LUVS diapers. But LUVS are $12 cheaper per box. I hated the smell of LUVS, that's why I returned back to Pampers. I assume that they use more harmful chemicals in LUVS, that's why they are much cheaper and with strong odor. But when I opened this box Pampers Baby Dry, I was shocked by exactly the same smell that was in LUVS diapers. I want to return them. I am very disappointed. Pampers Swaddle, I used before I bought this box, didn't have that smell.",1
Love it! I tryed to switch to different brand and I was sorry. Pampers is the best for my baby. ,5
"Great diapers, best price on line and they are delivered right to your door which is great.  We love pampers and that is all my daughter has worn since we came home from the hospital.",5
"It unfair the count is reduced  manufactures costs are so little, it is not fair to retain huge margin on diapers by amazon.",1
"staty at home dad writing this review...Thought I was being strategic when I purchased six boxes using subscribe n save... plus coupon.  nevertheless, a nice chunk of change.  But it sounded smart... just moving into size 6... 18 month old and thinning out... this size should last a while... my basic, sleep deprived logic.my bad, it turns out.  On the 10th diaper of pamper dry size 6 economy we encountered a strange but powerful episode.  Baby was having organic apple sauce for dinner... allowed to play crazy using spoon... and a lot of the apple sauce ends up on naked chest...  meanwhile, I'm making baby's main meal of meat and vegetables...  proud of my chef skills, I get ready to serve baby, when suddenly baby starts pushing at high chair tray... trying to get out... with kind of a strange, frenzied urgency.  My wife arrives, and I'm disappointed that we cannot start baby's main meal... but suggest that baby may be upset over a soiled diaper.  (why else would baby push to get out so abruptly... after a relatively short time enjoying food).as my wife begins changing the diaper, baby get even more hysterical.... and my wife indicates that she thinks his skin is hurting and / or burning.  Anyway, we debate the food, the high chair, unclear causes... but over the next hour it becomes clear that the baby has received a type of burning rash... extending from diaper lip area up around belly button.  Not really hives... but some red dots and a muddied reddish tone to baby's pale skin.A day later... more sleep for me, with some thinking... and more diapers causing some other baby skin reactions... and discomfort... I've now concluded that the apple sauce which dripped into baby's diaper during dinner probably dissolved something in the diaper... and caused the burning rash.  When I examine these diapers, I notice what appear to be an absorbent pad (with some embedded dry gel) extended very very far up near the waste band of the diaper. (kind of rare to see this absorbant padding so very high up... in my experience...with numerous brands... in my diapering experience.)Spoke with Pampers product support which graciously offered some reimbursement and  for their health safety reviews.nevertheless, if you're interested in this ""economy pack,"" I would suggest purchasing a small amount to evaluate with your baby.",1
"Simply put, Pampers are just the best diaper that we have found.  The wife and I have tried Luvs, Huggies and even some natural brand that I forget who makes but honestly I don't think there is a better diaper brand available.  They are soft on a baby's skin, almost NEVER leak unless there is extenuating circumstances like super diarrhea (which be honest there is not a diaper on the planet that is going to help you.  Also with the subscribe and  save option on Amazon they are incredibly economical.Best diaper for all new parents.  Just get the best and stick with it.",5
Pampers Baby Dry is better and more economical than any other Pampers lineup!  I tried night time as well and did not find the cost benefit.,5
"I expected these diapers to be a little thicker. They feel pretty thin and they don't hold up to 12 hours through the night as advertised on the box.  On the plus side, they feel light and soft, they have a cute design with the different characters from Sesami Street (each diaper has a different character).",3
"This product is advertised as keeping baby dry for ""up to"" 12 hours so I guess we should not expect that the longer duration is the norm.  These diapers are flexible and not bulky but neither are they any better at absorbing than any others we have used.  The old unimproved version did as well if not better in terms of leakage and you got more diapers/box than with these.  P&G; packaging and advertising is not different than anybody else's these days ~ less product for ""the same price"".  The company's dissembling and spin are very off  (if I were rating the PR they would get one star)  and the diapers are just average in terms of cost and effectiveness.",3
"I definitely recommend pampers in this size. After having 4 babies in four years, this is my diaper regiment...Newborn: swaddled newborn. Absorbs, great size, cutout for the belly button1 and 2: pampers. These are absorbent and smell nice3 and above (or once they start crawling): Huggins. They move with the baby and seem to not have as many accidents. The only downside is that they stink. I feel like my baby always smells like urine.Always the pampers wipes. They are the nicest!",4
"So soft, almost fabric like diapers that do not irritate sensitive skin. Babies in size two diapers are starting to move around, and the baby dry diapers have no trouble moving with them and do not rub and chafe their skin. It is a high quality diaper that baby will be very comfortable wearing. I had no problems with overnight leaks with this diaper and found to to be snug in all the right places. Even when full the diaper is not bulky and the moisture is kept away form the skin. Taking an overnight diaper off, other brands left my childs backside wet, not the baby dry! I love these diapers and the improvements they have made over the years have been fantastic I have found. The box is an amazing value and should last an entire month.  Every baby is different though, so this might not work for everyone.",5
"I use to only buy these diapers because I felt like I could trust them. However, I feel like P&G;'s whole goal is to suck you in as a customer and keep you because you trust their brand. They claim to have produced a ""better"" diaper that is more absorbent and because of this they had to sacrifice the amount of diapers that come in a pack. This is absolutely ridiculous.They already sell diapers that are marketed to be more absorbent or bend with your baby. These high quality pampers cost more because, they are in fact made better. The baby dry are not up to this standard. They seem to be made with cheaper materials (thinner) and I have also had issues with the straps. As far as being more absorbent, its a NO. Why would a company try to improve a diaper that never needed improving? If they would of offered the same diaper but added 10-20 diapers per pack then I would still be a buyer. But because I feel like P&G; is just trying to get as much money from us as possible, I am done paying for these diapers that are a far cry from luxury. Luvs diapers have a very distinct perfume-y smell that makes me wonder whats being used. I feel like they are reasonably priced if you child doesn't have sensitive skin. My baby's eczema flares up every time I buy them. I'm just over it. I would like to know who's out their conducting these surveys asking mom's what they would like to see change with the Baby Dry's- I can bet it wasn't asking for them to be more absorbent- It was probably somewhere along the lines of more affordable and more value packs. The ones that offer a real value per diaper. Having a dollar off coupon for these is like getting a whooping 4 diapers for free. That is another thing about this company that sucks. They make you feel like a couple of times a year their saving you money! And their not. Their luring you in and expecting to keep you as customer till your child is pottery trained. I realize now that there are far better deals on diapers elsewhere.",2
"Great diapers for heavy wetters!  I used the pampers cruisers before this one, and I have to say that I really like these even better.",5
These are the BEST diapers.  They keep our son dry for overnight or long car trips and they are worth every penny.  These are our go to diapers for sure.,5
"The only diapers that do not leak over night for my son, and we have tried them all. Excellent for my tall, average weight, 16 month old, since day 1!",5
These diapers keep baby and toddlers dry for longer periods of time without leaking.  My toddler could easily last all night long without soaking thru.,5
These always fit no matter what age our children are. I don't think I have ever seen a single diaper poorly or wrongly manufactured.,5
After noticing how theyre were less diapers per box i decided to shop around for different brands. We tried huggies since the quality is supposed to be comparable...big mistake! We did this on our vacation and every diaper change i made and her privates were covered in that jelly beads that are usually inside the diaper! Horrible...went back to pampers and love it!! Love the new improvements!,5
"Why the heck did you'll reduce the diapers Less Diapers same price it seems the same as before so why lesser We used them for our first daughter, now I just went to order some for our twins and I see the prices increased per diaper... Less diapers same price. Possibly shopping else will see .",3
"I simply can't understand why pampers can't keep both the new version and the old version, for consumers benefits, if it's simply a cost adjust issue.Please provide a reason why not give us both choices, thanks.",3
"These are my favorite diapers. My sons very rarely has leaks from these diapers. Also, through Amazon Mom the 20% off is the best price that I've found - even at Coscto. I recieved 1 box of diapers per month through Amazon Subscribe + Save and it's the perfect amount for 1 month.Additionally, you can go to their website (pampers.com) and put the sticker number (located on each diaper package) to earn points for merchandise.",5
"Diapers are fine, but the price has remained the same but instead of 222 diapers there are only like 204 in the box.  Why is amazon no longer carrying the largest size boxes, and hasn't lowered prices either?",2
Extremely disappointed with the quantity change and higher price. I will look for other options. I still don't know if there is any change in quality.,1
"I am so amazed, impressed, and happy how Pampers has improved these Baby Dry Diapers! The only ones for us!",5
These have worked great for our baby. Haven't had any problems with leakage as others have mentioned and no rash or other obvious signs of discomfort for out little one. He doesn't care about the sesame characters printed on the outside he poops just the same if they were there or not so have to question the value of that but otherwise quite satisfied with this product.,4
"I'm a Luv's guy.  My wife is less enthused, but I think they're the right combination of low price and above average construction.  Good, but not great.  These Pampers diapers are slightly nicer, but slightly more expensive (at least in my area).  Would I be willing to spend a little more?  Yeah, I think so.  What I like best about these is the better adhesive on the tabs.  I find them to be basically the same size as other size 3's that I've tried, and while I haven't noticed a particularly different dryness, I suppose they could work as explained.",4
"I usually use Huggies but wanted to give Pampers a try. I liked these diapers, they protected well and their was no leaking. I would buy these diapers again.",5
"Disappointed that we are going from 140 diapers to 128 diapers for the same cost.  While I understand changes have been made to product, we have been using them for 2.9 months (since son was born) and I'd hate to have to switch now.  But we already have had to go out and buy diapers because 140 were used before our month was done.  Going to have to rethink this now.",5
"I'm diapering my fourth child and trying Pampers for the first time.  I usually use Huggies and will use Luvs, Kirkland or cloth also.  This current little guy is a very heavy wetter and nothing at all has held up well at all...even double stuffed cloth.  These Pampers have done better overall than anything I've tried.  They still leak overnight...but we sometimes make it 8 hours now and during the day these have been a big improvement.  So,  I'm sold and will be using these again.",5
"I didn't realize that Pampers was differentiating between night-time diapers and day-time diapers, but that would explain why I had been disappointed in the few packages of Pampers Swaddlers diapers we've used with this baby.  The Swaddlers were so thin (which I know has become the goal of most name brands) that when the baby wore them overnight, it turned to a big bubble of gel, and often leaked.  I prefer diapers with more thickness of actual fiber and less gel, I guess.We'd also been having the same issue with the Luvs diapers we'd recently bought for our 6 month old.  He still nurses at night, and I prefer not to wake either of us up more than necessary by changing diapers.  But if I didn't get him changed as soon as I woke up in the morning, he'd end up leaking in his bed.  It's even worse now that he turns himself over onto his stomach in the morning hours.The Pampers Baby Dry is working great for the overnight hours.  I can nurse him as needed at night, without changing his diaper.  He hasn't leaked overnight, except the one time I put him to bed with a slightly wet diaper already.  (He surprised me and fell asleep early and I meant to change it before I went to bed, but forgot.)  Even more importantly, he hasn't developed any diaper rashes from wearing the same diaper all night.But it's not a miracle diaper.  He still occasionally manages to leak breast-fed BM a little bit out of the legs, and occasionally a lot right up his back.  I haven't met a diaper yet that he can't overflow with poop, though.The diapers fit him well, and seem soft and comfortable.  The velcro tabs don't pop open as he scoots around the floor on his tummy, but they are still easy to open when I am ready to change his diaper.  The Baby Dry diapers do not have a wetness indicator, but it's easy to tell by squeezing the diaper if it's dry or wet.Overall, I'm impressed with the Pampers Baby Dry.  I'll try to keep buying them for night-time use as long as I can find good sale-prices on the larger cases.  When I can't find a decent price, though, I'll probably return to buying the thicker store-brand diapers from Walgreens, Wal-Mart or Dollar General.",4
"I have to say, I was a Huggies fan up till now but these fit very well with a slim profile and work like a charm, keeping baby dry overnight. Size 3 is just a little big for my healthy-sized 4 month old but they still fit snugly with no leaks.",5
"We use these with our 6 month old and have not had a night time accident since we started using them over a week ago.  She uses size 2 diapers during the day, and the size 3 overnights are perfect.",4
"Everyone has their favorite diapers for whatever occasion, but Pampers Baby Dry are great for longer wear.  They are advertised to be worn for 12 hours, which is great for long nights or times extra coverage is needed.  Pampers can be a little pricier than some brands but if you aren't gonna change baby really often, these are worth the difference.  At around a quarter a piece (depending on size), they aren't terribly unreasonable since they offer extended protection.  Overall, these diapers are great!",5
"I like the interior elastic on these diapers..  It's not scratchy like others I've tried.It also helps keep in the stuff you want to keep in.These diapers are great for overnight and also for long trips, like on an airplane.They have a nice design, that makes them look like underwear so they are presentable in public.",4
"I have always used Pampers for my other kids, and Baby Dry is awesome because my baby's sleep does not have to be disturbed because of frequent diaper changes at night.  It does not give her a diaper rash and suits her skin very well.My wife and I have tried other brands to save money, but ended up regretting buying those because they gave my kids diaper rash, or they have to be changed more frequently.I see other reviews that say that Pampers are now more expensive and they leave 1 star reviews based solely on price.  If you find an item too expensive, then do not buy it.  Pampers is not trying to deceive you in to buying their product.  If their product was defective or non-functional then sure, a 1 Star is deserved.I personally do not mind paying more over Huggies, or store brands, if my baby is happy and sleeps better.  Some babies may be happy with those other brands, but they did not work for my babies.",5
"I have been using Pampers for years [4 kids later] and I love they way they smell and the way they absorb. I rarely if ever have a leak and believe me I let them get full. The baby dry are cheaper than the swaddlers, but absorb the same in my opinion. I highly recommend these, especially in bulk. Great deal!",5
"This book was purchased for our Son who is in the US Navy (deployed). We are Unable to review the book since we can't communicate with him. He doesn't have an Instructor/Teacher, it is self teaching at this point, hopefully it will be very beneficial.",5
"Like most other new parents we got several other brands of diapers at our daughters baby shower, as well as for birthdays, for holidays, from friends whose own children had outgrown a size and wanted to get rid of leftovers.Almost without exception, those other brands have failed us big time in one area - Overnights. Our daughter is an incredibly sound sleeper, ranging from 12-14 hours per night at age 2. Pampers Baby Dry are the only ones where she doesn't wake up in the morning soaked from head to toe. She has sensitive skin and some of the other brands give her rashes but we've never had anything like that happen with Pampers.The one thing I'd love to see is something for tall babies - weightwise she could fit into a 3 or 4, but she is off the charts heightwise and so we need to go with a 5 to have it fit right, leaving it real baggy since the 5 is for babies with a little more weight than she has. Other than that we have no complaints whatsoever.",4
We found Pampers Baby Dry when princess was in #2s.  Now we don't dare go without them.  I don't care how much they cost.  (Well - of course I do.) But we do a LOT less laundry on a weekly basis because of the protection these diapers provide.  They DO absorb more than the ones we use for daytime.  The fit a growing active baby very well and they save us the time and expense of extra loads of laundry all the time.  We haven't tried any of the other brands' overnight offerings.  We found one that works and are too spooked to muck around with the voodoo to see if something else is just as good.  We're like that about laundry detergent too.  Go figure.,4
"Last month I recieved a box of Pampers Swaddlers from Vine.  I had used Pampers before, but not in a long time.  They are expensive and I hate that both P&G; brands (Pampers and Luvs) use perfumes in their diapers. I know some people like the perfume smell, but to me it is unnecessary for my son to smell like baby powder.  Anyway, back to the box of Swaddlers.  They were free, and I like free, so I thought I'd try them.  We started out using cloth diapers when my son was born 15 months ago, but after having to put him in full-time daycare, we switched to disposables to save our sanity.  We bought Seventh Generation, but then as he grew we decided that they were too expensive.  I started trying every brand I came across that was on sale, including store brands.  I concluded that they all pretty much perform the same for us, except for night time (we use Huggies Overnights) and that I was not going to be brand loyal.The Swaddlers all but changed that.  I LOVE how soft they are.  LOVE THEM.  Have been obsessed with Pampers since.  I want to buy Pampers all the time, but my budget will not allow.  I can even overlook the smell factor because of their cushy goodness.  I even like the indicator strip.  My son wears size 4's, so we don't need it for pee, but when he was sick a few weeks ago it sure was handy to see if he'd gone #2 at all!  Anyway, love Swaddlers.This month I saw the opportunity to snag another box, this time Baby Dry.  I had read all about Dry Max early on and I was nervous about it because we tried Baby Dry before and had a rash, but supposedly the Baby Dry does not have Dry Max, but the Swaddlers do. (I am still not clear on this, why does it not say on the box?!?)  Ok, so fine.  My son did not react to the Swaddlers.  I received the box of Baby Dry yesterday. The Baby Dry fit just fine, even in size 3, and are definitely bigger than Huggies size 3, which is great.  My boy is long and lean and they give him a nice glove-like fit.  I do think they feel thinner, cheaper, and more papery than the old Baby Dry.  But again, it has been awhile.  I don't mind my diaper having a little cushion to it.  Baby clothes are designed to accomodate.  What's this obsession with thinner, thinner, thinner?I have not had any leaks, despite the fact that I'm putting my 25lb son in a size 3 when he probably should be moved up to a 4.  They seem comfy to him and stretchy enough to allow him to climb, roll, and run.  We have not had a rash with the Baby Dry diapers, and I will be buying these again.What I still don't care for are the characters on the diapers (driving up the price for sure because of licensing) and the smell.  Once you open the package they do air out and once they are on the baby the smell is very, very faint.I'm loving Pampers.  I wish I'd started using them from the beginning.",4
"Let me start this off by saying I am a big fan of Pampers diapers.  I have been using them almost daily since 2007.  I've gone through a lot of changes with the Pampers brand and I've stuck it out, even through changes I did not like (the removal of the netted lining in Cruisers -- for shame!!!), but with the price increase and count decrease, I think our family is going to have to seriously reconsider cheaper alternatives or going all cloth.I really like the updated graphics.  The design is a nice change to the  previous designs that I've looked at for three or four years now.  What I am not sure I like yet are the changes to the adhesive strip and the changes to the center core of the diaper.  The fastener strip now has a wavy pattern to it, and is apparently the same strip that they use on Luvs diapers.  The strip in the middle of the Baby Dry diapers used to be a solid aqua green color, but now it has a blue and white streaked liner on top of the green liner.  I am not sure that they have actually added anything, rather they have just changed the color of the top layer.  The Luvs diapers have, for several years now, contained that same white and blue streaked top layer.What I am pretty sure I am not going to like is the fact that you no longer have size numbers on the bottom strip of the fasteners.  It is now printed directly on the design of the diaper where you have to sometimes really look closely to see what size you are grabbing (this would not be a problem if you are only diapering one child currently). For a minute I thought there was a goof and someone forgot to add the size because it is so small and buried.  This is apparently a P&G; universal change as the four packs of diapers I have bought this month all are made this way now, including the Luvs and Cruisers.I look at the new Baby Dry diapers, and I now am asking myself if it's really worth th extra money to buy Baby Dry as opposed to Luvs.  They say Pampers, but they look more like Luvs.  While I realize that they are both manufactured by the same company, I guess I always felt like I was getting a more premium product that was going to function better when I purchased Pampers.  I have bought all of the new diaper packages I could find at our local stores in P&G; brands (that is Swaddlers, Cruisers, Baby Dry, and Luvs), and I can see that they have made subtle changes to be able to make more profit out of less materials.  I can't say that I blame them for wanting to cut costs and materials, but what really sticks me in the rear is that while they redesigned them to make better use out of their materials, they put less diapers in every box!  I would feel better about the changes I guess if they had left the size numbers alone.  This is the third time I can really remember a large price hike since I have been diapering babies, and it never gets easier to swallow that we are forced to pay more for less.  There is no real solution here, except for maybe going cloth full time for our family as opposed to the part time we do now.  I have some pictures to post as well, if I can do that from a mobile device.",3
I have an eight month old grandson.  I gave his parents both the Pampers and Luv diapers to try with him.  They had been using Huggies. All in all they reported that Pampers was significantly better than the competition.  They found overnight protection better and that they were not as bulky.  Also they said that the tabs work better.  This is the diaper they intend to keep using.,5
"I received Pampers Swaddlers from the hospital where I delivered my baby. When it came time to buy more, I bought Swaddlers. I figured that there must be a reason why my hospital uses these, right? Then I tried Baby Dry, since they're a little cheaper than Swaddlers. Though Baby Dry works great also...I think I'm just going to stick with the Swaddlers because Swaddlers feel a little thinner, softer, more flexible. I'm sure this means the Swadders are more comfortable for baby even though she cannot tell me. Also, I like the Swaddlers because I love the wetness indicator strip on the front.Both Swaddlers and Baby Dry can be worn all night. Super absorbent and keeps baby's bottom bone dry. My baby can pee several times through the night and be comfortable enough to not need changing until she wakes up in the morning.I'm willing to pay a bit more for Swaddlers (for the indicator strip and the thinness) but don't get me wrong, these diapers are great! I wasn't disappointed and neither will you be if you buy these. I love the huge box...it almost lasts forever...which for me is about 3 weeks. Great diapers in a huge economy box delivered straight to my doorstep. Thanks Amazon!!!",5
That's a diaper nothing like I have never seen pampers is a brand that we all love no reason to buy anything else I have learned the hard way the generic styles and No Good,5
"These new Pampers are better than any other diaper I have used, and I have tried them all!  For my baby shower, guests were asked to bring diapers or wipes to be entered into a raffle for a gift card, so I got every brand and size of diaper available (and I also have not had to buy diapers until several months later!  What a blessing!).  But back to Pampers, they have been the clear favorite for my baby.  Less blow outs, easier to use, absorbant, and occassinally the greatest advancement in diapr: the color changing strip to tell you the diaper is messy.My only complaint for the New Baby Dry diapers is that they do not have the color changing strip.  Otherwise, I find them to be an improvement to an already superior product.  They are thicker, heavier and more absorbant. You can feel and see the difference.And they are designed with adorbale baby creatures form Sesame Street, so they have form and function covered!  I think these are great diapers and do as promised.  Recommended.",5
"I'm very happy with these diapers.  I haven't noticed any difference in performance between the new version and the previous one, but then again I wasn't having any issues with the previous ones either.  They keep my daughter dry even when she sleeps in them for 12 hours overnight.  She's even slept in the same diaper for 13 hours a couple of times and still no leaks.  I do like the new graphics better than the old ones (baby Sesame Street characters as opposed to the regular versions, which I've always thought were adorable).  Of course it's always irritating when the number of diapers in the box is reduced while the price stays the same, but that's the way it goes...the price of things goes up over time.  Hershey bars don't cost 5 cents anymore, either.  I'll continue to use these diapers because they do their job well.  All versions of Pampers as well as Luvs have had the count per box reduced, so the overall price differences are still the same, and I'm not willing to experiment with any other brands since some that I've tried (including the recently-updated Huggies) give my daughter horrible chemical-burn diaper rashes.",5
"These are great diapers!They fit well and rarely have leaks.  They don't have a weird smell, something I've noticed with other brands of diapers.  In fact, they smell nice!  I was having leaks overnight while using Huggies (we have twins and shop as Costco; they don't carry Pampers), and using these overnight solved my problem.  Honestly, if I didn't have a Costco and twins, Pampers would be the only diapers I would use!In the mornings when I change my twins, these diapers are full.  Really, really full.  They still never leak, and I am a happy parent!",5
Pampers are premium diapers. Other diapers succeed at preventing leaks but only Pampers prevent leaks and are super soft and slim. Pampers also seem to provide the best fit among any diaper I have tried. My daughter currently sleeps about 11 hours at night and these diapers provide great protection during that long stretch.,5
"My 7 month old son is quite the mover. He rolls, crawls and generally gets into everything. With all that these diapers keep him dry. For those long nights when he sleeps through the night and days when you may not get a chance to change him right away, these diapers keep him dry and happy.The hold a lot, do not leak, and seem comfortable. They move with baby so they are good for kids on the go.",5
"They are great,love pampers!! Have tried other brands, but was very disipointed...Always go back to pampers they are the best...",5
"These work great both for my 1 year old and my 3 year old. They stay on well, hold a lot of pee (we use them mostly at night, so that's important to me).I am not, however, fond of the smell of the diapers. It's not unbearable, but I prefer unscented, and that will keep me from buying these in the future. But if scents aren't a big deal to you, everything else about this diaper is great!",4
"I have always been a Pampers fan when my kids were growing up, so when I saw that Pampers had come out with the baby dry diaper, I knew I had to try them for my niece and nephew. They are all the advertisement says they are. They both sleep over frequently because mom works a late shift, and I have not had a problem yet. They both sleep through the night and I have not once experienced the bed being wet the next morning. I have in the past with other brands I care not to mention.",5
"We've been using these for a few weeks with our twin girls, they're easy to get on, haven't leaked once (even when worn all night) and tend to swell when wet, so it's easy to see when they need changing even when the girls are wearing onsies.We'll continue to get them in the future.",5
"I was going to spend a LOT more money through HSN for a CHI flat iron with the same options as this Flat Iron and i was gonna pay 4 flex pays and each one would have cost almost as much as the total price of this item. I have VERY thick, coarse wavy hair... It is EXTREMELY resistant to any form of straightening... dry coarse texture...  and ive always wanted long hair but couldnt have it without using a STRONG relaxer which destroyed my hair... left it in a suspended state of China Doll straight with NO other options...  well i;ve been growing my hair out for many months..  I have had to fight it tooth and nail.. multiple salon hair cuts to tame it.. I use a LOT of straightening products and on occasion.. yuck.. strong chemical relaxers you need a gas mask and hazmat suit to use... switched to a chi smoothing relaxer..  smoothed but did NOT straighten hair..Well i think i can TOSS a lot of that out now that i have my HSI. I put a lil of the Argan oil sample in my hair.  Heated up the iron and gave it a go without overly high expectations. In 20 minutes i had my shiny, silky. and Pin straight!!!  and no heat damage.. I was SHOCKED that this 40 dollar iron had all these options and worked so well I had to struggle so much with my hair before,but NO MORE!! The packaging is top notch as well..  and the storage bag is to die for. Also the Argan Oil is a MIRACLE serum... When i say miracle im not kidding..  God actually answered my years of praying for my hair to cooperate... its always been a love hate thing .. its SO much better than anything containing any type of silicone and i will be ordering a 4oz bottle of the HSI Argan Oil as a compliment for sure.. I currently use Chi Silk Serum.. while it is effective..  it does NOT come into the league of the HSI Argan Oil... it may be expensive for the oil but you get what you pay for... it doesn't take a lot.. I know my own hair texture and i can guarantee with the HSI iron it WILL close the cuticle.. make it soft.. shiny..  I haven't even used my Expensive Chi Hairspray.. dont seem to need it.. hair moves naturally and then back in place..  In the past i had to layer my hair in smoothing and holding products..i've Never been happier with a hair tool and i've had MANY.. and i still just cant get over the price.... I'm a man but I've been in the company of a LOT of stylists and designers and h ave access to high end products.. but i hate always having to beg them to style my hair and then its gone once the nights over like Cinderella.. i pay much more for a cut and style at the salon than i paid for this Flat Iron.  Also no more next day disappointment after the salon when i cant replicate what the stylist did ,, because with my HSI i CAN replicate it :) quite easily and quickly actually.. Also I color my hair EVERY 4-6 weeks... i colored my hair a week ago and i wasnt thrilled with it.. well the combination of this Iron and The Argan Oil my my level 4 chocolate brown color brilliant and luminous..Also the plates are of high quality.. very sturdy.. smooth.. i can tell they are very hard and also they FLOAT.. this is an IMPORTANT feature ladies and Gents who consider their hair their crowning glory. Since they ""float"" and move with your hair and rotate.. the iron is very easy to use and versatile depending on what you want to do with it.  Don't get me wrong i have an ENTIRE line of CHI products and already own one of their flat irons. Im a die hard Chi fan...  but you really oughta give this bargain of an item a try.  I will always love CHI but  i am VERY interested to see what HSI begins to do with its product line... though i only needed the iron and the Argan oil and i REALLY like that the Oil is Natural...  penetrates my hair.. unlike my other products which are mostly silicone based and layer up and sometimes actually seem to dry my hair. I knew the argon oil was superior the second i flattend the first section of hair.  I saw some steam but it made no sound.. and and pulled iron straight through and unlike with my other iron with no floating plates i flipped under at the end of section all in one motion...  The section was flawless.. no second or third run through.  and shiny.. very shiny.  Also my style has lasted a few days ;-)",5
"The only reasons I bought this flat iron was because the price was right - only $44.23 and the reviews were great. For $44 I thought it would be worth the risk of not knowing the manufacturer to go ahead and get this since it is a professional flat iron. I had been using a Chi iron. After reading several reviews on Amazon about how others had a CHI that broke, I thought it might be a good idea for me to get this as a backup in case my own CHI breaks soon. Now my old CHI is the backup and the HSI is my main one!This HSI flat iron is great. The features I love:-Adjustable temperature control-Swiveling cord so no tangles/twists-Plastic behind the heated plates does not get too hot so I can grab that part when I need to-Both straightens and curls my hair-Smooth plates, nicely constructed so my hair doesn't get caught up in it and pulled outI have very thick, curly hair and this flat iron does a quick job straightening my hair. i would recommend this product and would buy an HSI again if I had the need.UPDATE AFTER 1 1/2 YEARSMy HSI flat iron is still going strong! I use it about 3 times each week as my only flat iron. It works as well as it did on day 1 and I've had no problems with it at all!",5
"I bought this based off the reviews, I never heard of this company but I took a chance. So glad I did! First, props to amazon for shipping this in under 3 days, I didn't expect this to arrive for another week and a half. I used it right away and I cut my straightening time down to 25 minutes! That's a pretty big deal for me considering it normally takes me over an hour and my hair can only be described as (Troy polamalu) Samoan hair. The price of this straightener caused me to be skeptical because I figured if it was cheap that it didn't work well. Wrong! This is the best straightener I've owned and far surpasses my chi models. Take a chance on this product, you won't regret it!UPDATE: so it has been about a year and 4 months and I'm happy to say that my straightener is still going strong!  I use it about 3-4 times a week and am very impressed that it has held up considering it was such a cheap purchase.  If you are still on the fence about this product based off the little known brand, make the purchase.  It is well worth it and saves me about 30 minutes in the morning (my chi took just under an hour to straighten, the HSI takes me 15-20 minutes tops).  I'm happy that a $40 straightener lasted over a year and if it eventually gives out on me I will be ordering the same one again!",5
"I've converted from having a $20 straightener that I've had since I was in my young teens to buying this straightener. I was a little sketched out because I didn't know the brand very well, but after reading the amazing reviews on how great, and it being the #1 best seller, I went for it and bought it.  I got it in two days and I don't know why I didn't think about purchasing it earlier! It makes your hair look amazing and for under $60 it's definitely worth your money. it comes with a little red pouch for storage and a heat protective glove which I haven't needed yet but whateves! It heats up within minutes so you can get it done quickly. And the little bottle of argon oil it comes with makes your hair really soft. Totally worth every penny!",5
"First of all, fulfillment by Amazon was flawless. They ship it very fast and sooner than expected. I have Prime so it got here in 2 days. A+ for Amazon!Now on to the product:Many say that this HSI is better than Chi or Paul Michell. I was very skeptical because I've never heard of it and would be happy even if its just ok because of its low price.After just using it once, I am convinced that it is indeed better and the best you can buy for under $60.I have wavy fizzy hair that is hard to contour and control. After using this and the sample argan oil included, my hair was transformed just like you would see on TV Extreme Make Over. No kidding!Pros:Makes thick and wavy hair straighten easily and fastBest bang for your buckGood ergonomics allows amateurs to handle it like a proMakes hair silky soft with the include Argan Oil sampleCons:No auto shutoff timerUpdate:Mine stop working after about a year. I called them up and they sent me a new one no questions asked!They stand behind their products and customer service was excellent. I would give them an extra star making it 6 STARS but Amazon only allows for 5 max",5
"This is the BEST 1"" ceramic straightener I have ever used, and the price is phenomenal. I'm not sure why that other reviewer thought that this iron was a Chi product, but I'm happy that it's not. I had never heard of HSI before ordering, but I will defiantly buy any other hair tools that they make. The iron heats up quickly and has floating plates. My hair was very shiny after use, and I didn't need to use any sprays or sheens. With this flat iron, I can curl my hair, flip my hair, and of course straighten my hair. After use, my hair was bouncy and it looked almost as good as when I go to the hair salon. I could go on for hours about how much I love this new flat iron, but don't take my word for it, buy one for yourself before they raise the price. I forgot to mention that there is a teeny tiny bottle of hair serum that comes in the box with the flat iron. It works very well, but it is just a sample size, so don't expect it to last for more than 2 uses.",5
***update on my last review: ***  The flat iron deserves 5 stars. Amazon doesn't allow changing the stars so I will just edit my review.My review was about the iron not getting hot enough and was not working properly (my hair would not stay straight)The next day after I contacted them. I got an email from Jessica from customers service dept. Letting me know that she had read the review and she told me its very unusual but i must of received a defective one. Without any questions asked she had a replacement sent out to me the same day with express mail. Like I said before I give them 5 star not only for the amazing flat iron but for their great customer service,3
This flat iron works wonders on my hair. It leaves my hair shiny and smoothes the ends without leaving them rough and dry. The rounded edges makes curling hair a breeze. Another plus is that the temperature dial and on and off switch are located on the underside of the iron just below the iron plates. This is great because I never have to worry about accidentally increasing/decreasing the temperature or turning the iron off while styling my hair(This was a constant problem I had with my chi air smart). I use this flat iron in combination with got2b guardian angel flat iron balm spray.,5
"Folks, CHI used be the item to buy sadly the quality of CHI has diminished. They are now simply a famous name however no longer a worthwhile product.If you have doubts about HSI have no more. It's an amazing price for such an amazing flat iron. HSI is fabulous. I purchased this for my picky daughter who has some of the thickest hair I've ever seen. Her hair is curly too.When I gave her the HSI iron, I said to her try it and let me know how it works for you. She has a CHI too. Well when she finished, and much quicker than with the other iron, she said she LOVED it! She only had to pass it by her thick hair twice and folks it was very sleek and looked like natural straight hair.Don't have any hesitation. I realize we all work harder to save where we can yet we do not want to sacrafice quality. You will get a quality iron for a great price.Have a blessed 2013 folks!!",5
"This came in a timely fashion. The extras (glove, oil, pouch) much appreciated. I almost sent it back though because I couldn't get it to turn on. I gave up and set it aside for a couple days. Then decided to give it one more shot. The reset button was hard to press. But once I got it going it heated up very fast and my hair stayed straight for two days after. Love the swivel cord too! I recommend!",3
"I normally don't write reviews, let alone lengthy ones. I also am not easily persuaded by reviews either. I felt compelled to write a review about this product. Let me start off by saying I have been a proud Paul Mitchell owner for about 8 years. I am kicking myself for paying 100+ for this iron. I am an African American with transitioning hair and let me tell you.......this thing is the BEST, one pass and my hair was straight. I went over it a second time just because of habit and disbelief I think. I used it on my daughter's hair first. She is all natural 3A I would guess. This thing made small work of all those curls in half the time. It straighten with ease no snags and the next day after a misty rain she is still in good shape. I don't even think I will have to flat iron my hair again until I wash it. This iron is just that good. Normally after a washing my daughters hair will still be straight without product but will have a little frizz. This time no product or frizz. My hair on the other hand HAS to have a go over every two or three days especially for my bangs if I have not gone to the hairdresser for a professional pressing. This time I can't tell I haven't been to my stylist. My hair has movement and is shiny. I just can't say enough. I can get all my roots. I think I may just call this a ""stretch"" this time because if this thing performs this well on my 12 week post hair, I am curious to see what it does on freshly relaxed hair. I won't need to go to the stylist every week. I can go only for relaxers and do my washes at home. I almost forgot to mention that mine did come with the glove, argon oil and red pouch. I will be buying these as gifts for my friends that loved to borrow my PM.",5
"I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  She has been raving about it for almost two months now.  Best one she has ever used.  She raved so much about the hair oil that came with it, I bought her that for Christmas.  Buy, you will not be disappointed!",5
"This flat iron works amazingly! I have very coarse and dry hair (naturally it is the kind of hair that shrivels up into a tight, packed afro at any sight of mist or water). Even though it is relaxed now, it is still very thick, somewhat kinky and dry. It gets damaged easily! This flat iron not only got it straight, but also made it shine and bounce (and all I used was a little bit of olive oil in my hair). It looked as if I had walked straight out of a shop!  In addition, it comes with a heat glove to protect your hand, a pouch to slide it in and a small bottle of hair serum (I have yet to try). Furthermore, it has a rounded shape so you can easily use this flat iron to curl your hair as well (which I also did). The curls are beautiful, bouncy and last. I have been searching high and low for a flat iron that is both affordable and provides salon results for African American women. I have found it! It is worth every penny!!!",5
"An excellent flat iron! On par with Chi or perhaps better. Besides the excellent price, this flat iron heats up quickly, slides easily through your hair, and its round body offers a comfortable grip. The same round body also makes it really easy to add a wave or tons of curls to your 'do. I watched a few customers reviews on this item before purchasing and one woman described how her hair remained straight even after having it up in a bun or pony tail all day. This is totally true! My hair reamins soft and silky while keeping its straight shape even if I push it behind my ears. The only downside to this item is that it doesn't have an automatic shut off switch. However, it has a convertable voltage (great for travelling overseas!), a reset button on the plug and comes in a nice case with a free bottle of Argan oil! The HSI is an amazing flat iron that I recommend to anyone, especially if you have hair like mine that is stubborn when it comes to straightening.",5
"I just received this item as a Christmas gift yesterday and decided to use it today. After seeing so many positive reviews, I decided to put it on my gift wish list and I am so happy that I did. Let me start by saying that I have very thick curly/kinky natural hair. I used the product along with the trial size leave-in argan oil that came in the box. I only had to glide the flat iron over my hair once and my hair was silky, shiny, and soft! I was blown away! I have used the CHI and FHI flat irons in the past, and this flat iron is much better! I am in love:-)",5
"I am African American and I have been trying to transition from perms to natural hair, but straight natural hair. I used to use a Remington hair straightener and it worked okay for the most part but for some reason my hair never shined the way I wanted it. I was looking at getting a CHI but then I came across HSI and decided to research a bit more before I made the purchase. I am super glad I decided to take a chance on this straightener because I have never, ever had straight hair without having to use a perm and to be honest my hair never took to perms that well either. My hair is about 8 inches and kind of coarse when not permed and my new growth is especially hard to straighten because the hair is super coarse and curly. I used this for the first time tonight and I had straight hair on one pass. I will tell you what I used on my hair to get a perm look without the chemical!I mixed together the following products to get super soft, shinning and nutrient-infused hair:Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Moisturizing Hair Lotion100% African Shea Butter (purchased from Amazon)Nature's Way EfaGold Coconut Oil Pure Extra Virgin (purchased from Amazon)Now Solutions Castor Oil (purchased from Amazon)Now Solutions Jojoba Oil (purchased from Amazon)Lemon Essential Oil (purchased from Amazon)After I mixed this together in a quick application my hair was seriously soft, manageable and amazing when I straightened it. I wanted to see how all these products worked together and now I am going to melt these items together to get an even mixture and place the grease in a container and refridgerate to make it firm again. This coupled with the straightener equals amazing results and should definitely be attempted. There was also no burning smell as I straightened my hair and the room did not fill with smoke as I am used to it doing with my Remington.I am not sure if the Argain Oil works because with all the oils I placed in my hair I did not need to use another to straighten my hair. I will try that later on and report back. The package came with a beautiful red sleeve to place the iron in and I love that touch. I don't know how a CHI performs so I cannot relate to the differences or similarities but I do know that if you are on a budget and prefer to have amazing hair without having to shell out over a hundred dollars then this is your straightener. I highly recommend this.Just to note: I am not a puppet who was promised anything from the company or seller to leave a good review as well as I do not work for HSI. This review is coming from my honest usage of this product from a long time Amazon consumer.",5
"I purchased this flat iron after reading the reviews and I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.  I have very fine hair and am delighted that I have full control over the EXACT temperature of the iron.  Even at a lower temperature, the results are wonderful... Super straight hair!  I also find myself occasionally using this in place of my curling iron.  It is really a pleasure to use.The HSI hair straighter is solid and very well made!  The digital read-out is an attractive feature, although the numbers are a bit small (as well as the buttons), but this has not been a major issue.It HSI Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener came with a free heat glove and travel pouch, along with a small bottle of Argon Oil (which I LOVE!).  I never have an issue with forgetting to unplug my hair tools, but the automatic shut-off is an added security feature that I appreciate.My daughter has the CHI straightener but seems to be gravitating towards my flat iron now :). This is definitely a nice product and something I would highly recommend.",5
"I bought this iron based on the reviews and the awesome sale price, and it certainly didn't disappoint.  I used a CHI before buying this HSI, and the HSI far outperforms the CHI.  It heats up super fast, and it's heavy enough that I don't have to squeeze super hard to get my hair straight.  I also love that the outer cover stays a lot cooler to the touch than the CHI -- I burned myself several times on the CHI, but that won't happen w/ the HSI.",5
"I ordered this flat iron for my little sister who has really thick hair - and I'm not exaggerating when I say her hair is thick. Her hair is that in-between straight/wavy.  Her old flat iron took nearly 2 hours to ""straighten"" her hair. Really, it didn't make much of a difference. After a few hours out in the southern weather her hair was back to a frizzy mess. So, I decided to surprise her with a new one.I was really impressed by the quality of the straightener even before we used it. It's really well made and the argan oil that's included smells incredible! (I just ordered a full size bottle.) You also get a glove to protect your hand from the heat. (It was way too big for either of us, but we have really tiny hands.) The plates on the iron are wide, but not too wide. It's the perfect width, in my opinion. It's comfortable to hold. It's not too heavy, but it's not lightweight and cheap-feeling either. And it has a swivel cord to prevent the cord from tangling.I set the heat near the middle of the temperature control knob. I'm guessing it was just a little over 300F. We put the argan oil in while we let the iron heat up. (It heats quickly!) It takes only a couple of drops. Just rub it on your palms and spread it through your hair. It makes the hair so smooth and gives it a nice sheen, without looking oily. And it smells so good! I could go on all day about the argan oil itself. I really love that stuff. :) Some reviews state that the iron didn't stay hot, but ours did. It took less than 30 minutes to straighten her hair and it came out pin straight. She walked around the house for the rest of the night grinning from ear to ear and playing with her hair. We were outside for 2-3 hours in the 80+ degree, humid weather and her hair remained straight and frizz free.  Her dad also commented that her hair looked healthier.I tried the straightener out myself the following night. I have fine, blonde hair that's easily damaged by any type of heating tool. My hair is straight, but on this particular evening I woke up with slight waves. I just really wanted to try the straightener on my hair. It only took about 10 minutes for me. I've only used a straightener on my own hair a couple of times before, but this iron is so much easier to use than any other one I've tried. I used the lowest heat setting and it worked perfectly.Then, the night after that I used it to put curls in my ponytail. It took me few tries to get it right, but it made some really cute barrel curls. They were barely there after a night of work, but I didn't use any other styling products to hold the curls in - just the argan oil and iron.I have nothing bad to say about this flat iron. It exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend it. Just be careful where you sit it while you're using it or while it's cooling down, because it gets hot. The handle itself doesn't get hot, but the plates certainly do. We use the carrying pouch to rest it on while doing our hair - then place it inside the pouch while it's cooling down. You could go ahead and buy a full size bottle of the argan oil, because you're going to fall in love with it. It doubles as a thermal protectant and leaves your hair looking smooth and healthy.",5
"I purchased this straightener after cutting about 6 inches off my hair, since my hair was no longer really long it wasn't weighing it's self down as much and was doing all sorts of crazy things. I wanted an awesome straightener and looked at Sephora and the prices were outrageous. This item appeared to have all same stuff as the expensive ones at sephora had and I figured for the price I should give it a shot! I received the straightener very quickly and used it immediately and was in love. I loved that it came with the heat resistant glove, it makes straightening easier and safer, and I really like the carrying case it came with.The straightener is fantastic, I love that I can adjust the temp and it straightens and curls with ease. I have very very thick hair, even if its not as long as it was, and doing anything with this much hair takes forever but this straightener is so powerful I don't have to go over any of the parts more than once and it gets the job done quickly. I also have hair that dries out easily but these plates are as high quality as I was looking for and does not break or damage my hair. I am so happy with this product I would have paid a lot more for this straightener but I am most pleased with the price. Great Product and amazing price! I am very please!",5
"I'm African-american woman with natural hair. So I was at first a little hesitant on buying any flat-iron, thinking I wouldn't find something that would do my hair justice. I bought the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron based on what the other reviews have said and I'm glad I did! My hair is so straight! It looks as if I have a relaxer in; and I've gotten multiple compliments based on the results. So far, I'm very satisfied considering this has been the first time I've straightened my hair since I've been natural (2 years and counting). The price wasn't bad either and I didn't want to get something that would damage my hair. Yes, the flat-iron does get pretty hot but you can control how hot you want it. And I've found that using the heat protectant as I straighten my hair protects it from being damaged. This is a great product!",5
I agree with most. I have never heard of this brand before so I was nervous about ordering one. I currently have a Chi and I thought it was going out so I just ordered one to try it. I am impressed. I have super curly natural hair and my mom asked me today if I got it chemically straightened. I love this product. I should have ordered a spare. I still have never heard of them but they now have a regular customer. I did not get the chi smoothing serium as promised but instead it was biosilk. That was fine with me it works just as well.,5
"I bought this hair straightener after reading the amazing reviews that it got. I also considered the huge discount I was receiving through amazon. I used this hair straightener for the first time for the holiday and my hair came out amazing! I am biracial so I have very course and extremely thick, curly hair. I used the argon oil provided by HSI and although the straightener did not reduce the time it took to do my hair, it definitely improved the quality!! Would recommend this hair straightener to anyone of any age or ethnic background. OUTSTANDING!!",5
"After purchasing many cheap flat irons and many split ends and damaged hair, I finally broke down and said I would purchase a Chi or another expensive name brank(oh boy am I glad I didn't). I did my research on **top flat irons** and after so many high customer rated reviews, I just had to purchase this flat iron and the price was so unbelievable. I'm sorry I didn't buy this sooner. I am so excited every-time I straighten my hair. It just glides thru my hair and not a single damaged end.I have shoulder length wavy hair and I am able to straighten it or curl. I cant wait for my hair to be long so I can create many more styles with this flat iron. The Argon oil it comes with makes it so smooth and doesnt weigh it down. I am extremely satisfied with this product and recommend it to every person that straightens their hair. Great product and I hope it last me for many more hair styles to come. HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch",5
"After my straightener for the last five years finally gave its last croak a few weeks ago, I was in the market for a new straightener.  Because of its reputation, I assumed I was going to get a CHI, but decided to look around a little first and came across this bad boy.  After looking at all the positive reviews and awesome price I decided to give this baby a chance.  I am so happy I did!  The straightener works way better than my old one ever did, the black handles and black plates give it a very sleek and attractive appearance, and it even comes in its own red satin-y lined black box which makes it feel like pulling a sacred relic straight from Dracula's coffin.  I would recommend getting some of the Argan oil too.  I decided to try it out the sample first before I bought a bottle and I should have just bought it then.  It makes my hair sleek and soft like a kitten.TLDR: Highly recommend this product, don't waste your money on a more expensive straightener because this one is awesome.",5
"I've been a flat iron user for several years now. People have raved about this HSI Iron, so I decided to give it a try. I am blown away by my results. One of my biggest pluses is that my hair is very shiny, even at the end of the day. Since I started using this flat iron I can go 4 days without washing and blow drying my hair.  I have had compliments and would suggest this flat iron to anyone who wants fabulous hair.",5
"My flat iron that I've used for years finally bit the dust so I was in the market for a new one that wouldn't cost me a fortune but still be a great product.  I hopped out to Amazon to see what other reviewers rated the flat irons and low and behold I came across all the great reviews for HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightner.  I had never heard of this brand before but now that I own one and have used it, I LOVE IT.  It was package very nicely including a carrying pouch, a heat resistant glove and a small sample of their Argan oil.  The iron itself feels like a top quality product, meaning it doesn't feel lightweight and cheap.  It has a nice long swivel cord that I think is a nice feature, along with a temperature control setting in degrees (not low, med, hi).  And let's not forget to mention the Argan oil sample that is included.  My hair is a little over processed and really dry but the combination of the oil and the straightner makes it silky smooth and soft.  So not only do I love the straightner, I love my hair again.  If you are in the market for a straightner definitely give this one a try.",5
I have very thick hair which is naturally curly.  I am a bit of a lazy straightener and occasionally would try to go too fast.  It doesn't matter with this.  It leaves my hair very straight and shiny.  I also use a spray heat protectant product (just a cheap suave product) and it just does a great job.  Warms up very fast.  I have paid a lot more for straighteners which don't work half as well.Best straightener I have ever used.  I will be buying another one for my mom's birthday which is coming up.  Cuts my straightening time in half!,5
"I have been looking for a flat iron that compares to the very expensive salon brand.  I recently had my hair damaged by an overprocessed perm.  I had to get a cut and a new style.  This flat iron is everything I have been looking for!  The price is what caught my eye, of course, but now that I have it, I know it is worth so much more!  The added Argan Oil is a special treat.  I have never heard of it.  It is making my damaged hair look more like it used to than any product I have used.  Thank you!",5
I love this flat iron.  I have had the t3 and chi and there is no comparison and the price is much better.  I had not heard of this brand but took a chance and I am so glad I did.  I am buyinbg another for my other home.  Try this flat iron and you will not be dissapointed.,5
"My hair: curly, long, fine strands (but a lot of them)I bought the HSI 1"" flat iron because of the smaller plate size.  I already have a 2"" CHI that I LOVE, but I wanted smaller plates to allow my hair more movement after it's been straightened (as opposed to the super flat, super straight hair from my CHI).  I planned to buy another CHI until I saw how fabulous the reviews were for this iron and the amazing deal offered on Cyber Monday.This flat iron gets nice and hot very quickly.  One of my primary concerns when buying another iron was that it would pinch and pull my hair on the sides of the plates.  Many other straighteners do that.  The 1"" HSI does NOT ever pinch or pull hair.  It leaves it shiny, straight, and soft.  I also love the satin sleeve that allows the flat iron to cool safely.  It is excellent for portability!  I used to cart my big chunky CHI to work for a little daytime hair sprucing.This is a great straightener!  I am very, very please with my choice to buy HSI instead of another CHI or any of the other brands out there.",5
"My chi straightener recently broke so I came across this product on Amazon, did a little research and read the reviews. All the reviews on the Amazon page were about how great the it works, how hot it gets, and general praises. There were a few negative comments here and there, which had personal customer service responses which sold me. This way i knew if something went wrong, I wouldn't be stuck with a crappy product, and someone will actually take ownership and help me replace/repair it.I received the straightener a little while ago through UPS. I wasn't home when they called, so they were extremely curteous enough to drop it off to me where I work, just down the street. The product it self is AMAZING. With my Chi and Babyliss straigheners, I've always had to keep them on the highest setting for my hair, and go over a section multiple times. Not with this one. I end up keeping it on half the heat setting, and only have to go over each section once to straighten. It's also amazing to curl with. It has great grip, and comfortable in your hands.The outside does get a bit hot, but thankfully, the package comes with a glove that fixes that if you're holding it for long periods of time.Overall, i STRONGLY recommend this product. It's the best I've ever tried, and i have tried A LOT of straighteners. I will be purchasing a second one for my sister soon enough. I can't stress enough what great quality it is, especially for the price, and even more so for the prompt and helpful customer service reps that seem to respond asap to any concerns on this page.",5
"I previously purchased a big name flat iron from a local retailer that had the controls on the handle where you couldn't help turning it on/off or up/down every time you held it.  After returning that one, I looked at the reviews and saw that this one had thousands of five star reviews on Amazon.  So happy I ordered it! It heats up very quickly, works very well to give your hair a smooth, healthy look, and the controls were on the inside where your hand doesn't disturb them.  Couldn't be happier.  It also came with extras, like a nice carrying case and coupons for styling products.  The shipper was wonderful, sending it out the same day I ordered.",5
"After two years my Chi had quit working. I paid well over $120 for my Chi straightener. I found the HSI, read the reviews and decided to give it a whirl. I love this straightener, it truly does a way better job than my chi. My hair is a little course and very thick, but my hair was left silky, bouncy and shiny after using the HSI. I highly recommend this product!",4
"I purchased this product after my long time flat iron suddenly and completely stopped working.  That day, I went to a local beauty chain store to purchase a replacement.  After using it for a day, I realized that this replacement flat iron just wasn't cutting it.  So I went on Amazon and searched the flat iron reviews.  The reviews for the ""HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron"" were among the best so I decided to order it.  All I can say is that it was one of the best purchases I've made.  Not only does this product deliver as promised (and more!) but the seller delivered my purchase on time and made sure it was securely packaged.  Finally, and just as importantly, I was thrilled with this product's price.  The quality of this product is definitely of a professional calibre - I still can't believe that I was able to purchase it for such a reasonable price.  Overall, this product and the service of the seller deserve 5 stars and then some!!!",5
"Two years ago I gave my daughter a CHI hair straightener, which I have enjoyed using whenever I visit her.  I mentioned that I was thinking of purchasing one for myself.  She told me about the HSI straightener, which customers review as better than the CHI and it sells for less than the CHI.  A few days later she emailed an offer for the HSI;  I ordered one immediately, and have been nothing but pleased since.  It is an excellent product!  I especially like that the heat is adjustable, as I have thin fine hair.  My daughter recently visited and tried my new HSI straightener. She liked it better than her CHI, and plans on making her next straightener the HSI.",5
"I am in love with my new flat iron! I did so much research prior to selecting this (I am one of those way too analytical consumers), and I have to admit I was nervous I would end up disappointed. Much to my surprise, I have been nothing but completely happy with this product. It heats up at very fast and it does everything you would expect a flat iron to do and more. I have friends who have CHI irons who are very impressed with this and who seem to be regretting overpaying for theirs.Kudos for the fast shipping and great customer service!",5
Best iron I have ever owned!  I can tell the difference between steel and ceramic plates.  My hair stays shiny and I have found that I don't need to use pre or post hair treatments when using this.  My hair has not been damaged since using this iron.,5
"This is a great flat iron. It came recommended to me by my sister, who borrowed my old flat iron and commented on how terrible it was. My old flat iron was very inexpensive but I thought it was good enough because my hair is relatively thin and straight already. She, however, commented on how it just wasn't hot enough, and how she had to take multiple passes over her thick, coarse hair. I confessed to having to wet my hair before straightening for my old flat iron to work, and that's when she recommended this to me. This flat iron is like night and day compared to my old cheapie. I can shower the night before and straighten out the bird's nest in the morning with no problems. My hair looks fabulous, in fact. Another major difference that I noticed was how much longer the flat lasted. With the HSI, I straighten my hair and it's immediately flat and glossy. And when I step outside: still flat and glossy. Throughout the day: still flat and glossy. I absolutely cannot say the same for the old cheapie. I've been experimenting with the different temperatures and have determined that the iron has to be very hot even for my thin straight hair. If I turn the dial down to medium, even, the performance of the HSI is just like my old cheap flat iron. I love that I can change the temperature, I love that there's a tiny little light indicator to signal to me that the iron is on and when it's ready for use, I love that the cord swivels, and I love that it came with a heat satchel. When I'm done with it, I just throw it into the heat satchel and throw it all in the drawer. I constantly left the old flat iron out because I didn't want to put it into my drawer while it was still hot. I also love the price for the HSI. I've never had one of the more expensive irons but I really don't think I'll need to after this. (And for what it's worth, the sister who recommended this to me had had a $100 iron. I don't know what happened to it but I think it says a lot that she switched to the HSI and didn't re-purchase.) The only ding that I can think of is that I can think of on this thing is that the power switch is inside a little close to the plates. But I just unplug when I'm done, so even that is moot. This flat iron arrived quickly and my interactions with the seller were nonexistent in a good way - I simply placed the order and then it showed up a few days later.",5
"I happened upon this flat iron after Googling ""Top reviewed flat irons"" online.  After reading the reviews for it on several websites, I thought I'd give it a try.  I have thick, frizzy, naturally curly hair. It's a REAL JOB getting it to NOT look frizzy after using ANY flat iron or hair care products.I couldn't BELIEVE the SUPERB job this flat iron did on my hair!  It was INCREDIBLE!  And, at just a fraction of the cost for what I paid for my CHI, or Babyliss flat irons!  Also, as other reviewers have stated it DOES take only one stroke through my hair layers to get them straight!(Other curling irons would take me two or three strokes).I also LOVE the ridges on the handle.  It allows me to get a better grip on the handle, thus providing additional ""no burn"" safety while using it. I like the argon oil sample that came with it, however, because it's so difficult to find products that work with my hair I stuck with my Nexxus Frizz Defy styling cream before using the flat iron, and Nexxus Frizz Defy hair spray after use.All I can say is - Give this flat iron a try!  I'm SURE GLAD I did!",5
"Ok, so here is the deal.The Good- I love this straightener- it works really well on my hair, I only have to take it through my hair one time and it is completely straight. Because of this, I also think my hair looks healthier than it has in the past, given that I don't have to run a straighter through the same pieces over and over (breaking and fraying the ends).The Bad- It broke after one month. I don't know what this issue was, or whether I just got a bad version, but it stopped working very suddenly. Yes, that was unfortunate and inconvenient. BUT, then...The Great- I e-mailed Blue Novelties and explained my dilemma. They sent one note back to try and troubleshoot, and after I responded that the product still was not working, they immediately overnighted me a new one- no hesitations, no hemming and hawing, I had a new straightener in hand in less than two days.So, to summarize, I really like the product. I am not sure what caused my first one to crap out early, however, I am very pleased with the seller's customer service and would still recommend this product to others.",4
"I was very hesitant on whether or not I should but this item because it had such mixed reviews. My old flat iron finally gave out so I decided to try this. It works like a dream. I have very thick, wavy hair and I managed to straighten it in 30 minutes (record time for me). It works way better than any flat iron I have ever had, including my multiple CHIs. I am uttterly amazed with this product. The item arrived sooner than expected too, which I was very happy about. I do not understand how anyone could give this product anything less than five stars. If you are in the market for a new flat iron, this is the one to buy, hands down.",5
"I like to have a spare professional grade flat iron on hand because the old one normally goes kuput at the worst time. I ordered this unit and received it in less than 5 days. Since I have never owned a HSI, I wanted to try it out before putting it on the shelf. All I can say is that I like this unit better than my CHI and it was 40 bucks cheaper. Great piece of equipment and the seller was lightning fast with shipping.",5
"I, too, have had CHI's previously. I had 2, and both stopped working within a year.Both cost well over $200. I had never heard of HSI, and was not sure, initially. The price really convinced me to give it a try. I was happily surprised! I have thick, curly hair and the HSI works very well. I burned myself on numerous occasons with my CHI. This is not an issue with the HSI, as the outer cover stays cool. It heats up quickly and goes through my hair smoothly. I would recommend it.",4
"I was blessed (or cursed, if you choose) with very thick, curly hair.  For years, I have wanted to wear those cute bobs and sleek looks.  I never thought it would happen.Several months ago, I ventured out of my comfort zone and let my new (yes, I said new) hairdresser cut my hair into one of the stylish asymmetrical bobs.  I definitely looked like a million bucks when I left the salon and thought I'd have this one day of perfect hair and the next two months of a frizzy balled up mess.A co-worker let me borrow one of her cheap irons and I used it until I found this one.  I had researched online for what seemed like an eternity and decided to buy this one - by the time I made up my mind, it had sold out.  I certainly had hoped that the HSI would give me that 'just walked out of the salon' look that the cheaper store brand hadn't (tons of fly-aways and daily frizzies...)During the holidays, I checked back in on Amazon for it's availability.  I had seen it advertised for about $89 then it jumped to $149 when I finally decided on it.  Needless to say, I was disappointed when it wasn't available and really forgot about ordering it until after the holidays.  When my co-worker needed hers back, I knew that I needed to order one and found it back in stock with Amazon.It arrived in a few short days and I was eager to try it out.I plugged it in the next morning and had absolutely NO trouble using it.  It gets very hot very quickly and I didn't need the hottest setting like I thought.  The iron glides over my hair and leaves it shiny and smooth.  Even the shorter pieces of the back of my hair are easy to straighten.I have gotten more compliments since using this iron than I ever have before.  It is definitely a must have for 'hair novices' like me and definitely worth the price.StephanieAugusta, Georgia",5
"I have been using flat irons for over 10 years, and it has been a struggle finding a good one that actually lasts and doesn't pull out all my hair out.I have been using a CHI that I spent over 200 dollars on, and not even a year later it just stopped working, it worked in the morning however in the evening it stopped. So I visited amazon went through the flat irons and the review and this one had some great reviews, plus the price was something I couldn't beat. It arrived within a couple of days, greatly packaged and when I tried it, I fell in love. It doesn't pull my hair out and the best part is it lasts through humiditym with the chi I had two straighten it 2 times sometimes 3 a day, this one I straighten before work in the am and by the time I get home from school )11ish pm) my hair is still shiny, still flat! I love it, I will never buy another chi! If I could give it 10 stars, I would.",5
"I was very skeptical about this particular product and I read every review. But I still decided to try it anyways after the comments. I am in love with the flat iron. My daughter has very course hair and I was like let me see if this will straighten her hair first and see how good it is before I perm her hair. I tried it and was very surprised and the curls last for at least a few days. It heats up very quickly and it does get very hot. I love the fact that the temperature and the on/off buttons are in the middle as I don't have to worry about my hands accidentally hitting the buttons and turning it off. Some people complained about it pulling your hair, well I have not had that problem. Also my flat iron does clasp all the way down and the design does not affect my ability to flat iron my hair at all as I saw that someone stated that as well. I just pray that it last for a while and I did get everything as advertised. Also, please be aware that when I first plugged the flat iron in, it did not come on. But the reviews stated to hit the reset button and it would power up. I did that and it was on right away. I am very satisfied with my purchase...",5
I got this iron recently and I am thrilled with it! It is the best iron I've ever used!!!,5
"Although I have only used this product once, I am very satisfied so far. The straightner takes a little longer to heat up than my old Chi (which is the only reason I deducted a star), but the straightening power is just the same and this straightner was just a fraction of the cost. The heat is strong enough for my hair and the straightner seems like its built to last. I have high expectations for it, and so far it is just as good as the old Chi.",4
"This is a great flat iron! I went natural a few months back and my hair is really, REALLY curly and dense. I wanted a flat iron that would get the job done without destroying my hair (i want to grow it out). After a lot of research, I decided to try it and the price helped me make my decision too (awesome price!) The first thing I noticed is that this flat iron gets hot SUPER fast, so if i was on limited time, that wouldn't be a problem. Another thing is that it glides sooooooo easily along my hair which really surprised me. I thought it would take me a few runs to get a part straight because let's face it, natural African American hair tends to be very stubborn. But no! I was able to finish my hair in about twenty-five to thirty minutes. My favorite thing is that it was able to straighten my hair with out crushing the volume. My hair looks so healthy! It's sturdy too, i doubt it will kick the bucket anytime soon. So.... try it!",5
"I was excited to get this flat iron. The first thing that I noticed when I recieved it was that the packaging was SUPER cute and an awesome red satin pouch was included to store and travel with this flat iron. I was surprised that there was not a free sample of bio silk included like the product description stated, however they did include a HSI version of a heat protectant. So, I was surprised but not disappointed. I thought the product reached the heat setting very fast. I did, however, have to return this product because mine wouldn't clamp down all the way. I mean, if I used both hands and all my might, I could get it to clamp completely, but who wants that. I want a flat iron that clamps down easily and straightens my hair. Maybe my product was defective, maybe they are all like that. I don't know, but I returned mine.",3
This is the best flat iron ever.  It makes your hair soft and bouncy.  I Love It!,5
"Like others have said, I don't think this product gets as hot as it says.  However, if your hair is fine and not very curly, then this product will work fine for you.  My hair is pretty fine and only gets a little wavy, and this product works great for it.  It leaves my hair shiny and it works great to smooth or curl my hair.  I got it on a huge sale and am happy with the purchase.  But, if you have very curly or thick hair, it may not be the best product for you.",4
"I would definitely recommend this straightening iron to anyone.  Before I bought this, I had a difficult time straightening my hair, and it took FOREVER.  With this iron, I can start with damp hair (not yet dry) and it will do an amazing job very quickly that lasts until I wash my hair.  Personally, I wash my hair almost every day but for those who are into not washing hair for a day or two this definitely makes straight hair that lasts.  My hair is also very long and at the 410* setting it straightens VERY fast.  I have not yet had a need to use the heat-resistant glove that comes with it but I can see how that would be useful.  Overall, I could not be more pleased with this product.  I plan to use it for a very long time.",5
"I have been looking for a good flat iron since I went natural in 2008. I bought a little cheap walmart brand flat iron and it worked OK but was not great. I only straighten my hair about 3 times a year and my hair never got as straight as I wanted it. With his flat iron my hair looks as if I just got a fresh perm. My hair is smooth, shiny, and manageable and you can't beat it for the price! This was a great buy!",5
"Very nice and only a fraction of the price. My hair became silky smooth and I am black with coarse hair. The glove was unnecessary to use because it does not get too hot on the outside to burn your hands. The oil package I have not used yet, but I am sure it will be nice. The iron is kind of bulky, compared to my last flatiron. My last one was not a name brand but it was also real ceramic plates. My old one glided much better but the HSI is still a great product. I would recommend it especially at this price. You have nothing to lose.",5
Great shipping time! I am definitely impressed. It is definitely a good replacement for your straightner. I was sketchy at first because I seen some reviews about it pulling or burning your hair ( ihave baby fine hair) but the straightner did neither! The argan oil is fantastic! My only complaint is that it does not seem to meet the heat settings it displays. I started off at 140 per the directions but I now have it set on 350 to get good results. Oh and in order to purchase a legit hsi straightner buy through Blue Novelties on Amazon (Hsi verified them as liscensed seller) otherwise you might get a fake.,4
"I bought it because my CHI finally broke. I've had so many straighteners in my life and my CHI was a godsend. When it died, a piece of me died with it. I asked around at a few salons what they would recommend for a straightener. However, I do not have $300 to spare on a straightener and I needed one now. After reading review after review of straighteners I finally decided to just jump in and get this one. The price was right for the amount of positive reviews.When my straightener arrived, I did not think I would like it.Now... I love it. In fact, I love it more than my CHI. Why? I'll tell you: time. This thing heats up, stays hot, does a comparable job to a CHI in less time. Maybe even a little better. It has temp control. The only downside is that I did experience some pulling when I first used it, but that may be because I was using so much force with my dying CHI to straighten my hair. If your CHI died and you're looking for something for now (and maybe for awhile) until you get a dream straightener, definitely go for this.",5
As an African-american female with coarse thick roots this flat iron is a heavenly gift! i wear sew-ins for protective style and use relaxer very sparingly. The hair I leave out of my sew-in consists of 14' strands. this flat iron gets my hair bone straight with its heat and leaves a silky shine touch that helps blend my natural with the weave. Looking forward to relaxing my hair and using this iron for my whole head. If you are looking for a quick heat-up iron that gives hair that salon look & feel this is the iron you need to purchase!,4
"I am very picky when it comes to flat iron being that I have natural African American hair. This flat iron works wonders and gets the job done. Usually when I flat iron my hair I'm never able to keep it straight for more than a day or two, especially being that I stay in Louisiana with all this humidity. But I would say with this iron my hair stayed straight for a week and it might have stayed longer, but I washed my hair. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS IRON TO ANYONE. My only con about the iron is that I don't necessarily like where the controls are placed.",5
This is the best flat iron I have owned so far.  It makes my frizzy hair smooth and shiny even in humid weather.,4
"I have been looking for a good straightener for years. I have tried cheap ones and very expensive ones. This is by far the best I have ever owned. If I could give it 10 stars I would. My hair is very curly and thick so usually takes me about an hour to straighten it. I just got finished using this one for the first time and after 20 min my hair looks amazing! It's soft, sexy and glossy. My husband just told me ""WOW Honey I Didn't Think I Would See You So QUickly done"".  If your looking at any brand this is the one! The glove is great for holding your hair... cause wow it's hot!!!  I had to sit down right away and write this review. Everyone at work told me get a CHI. I was going to but so glad I didn't. For the price ( which is a steal!!!!) this is the way to go!!! I read the reviews on everything I buy on Amazon so I hope this encourages someone else to buy this!!!!!!",5
Wife bought this to use in Italy since our old flat iron broke.  It works great and she loves it.,5
"This straightener was impressive right out of the box. I bought it to fight my unruly curly and kinked hair, and this makes it super easy to control all of that. I've had other straighteners that have fried my hair or that just didn't last for very long, but not this one. I've had this one for just about a year and a half now, and it isn't showing any signs of problems.It feels great in your hand and is easy to control and the ceramic plates are amazing in that they don't fry my hair and always leave it looking straight and feeling soft. It also came with a little bottle of HSI argan oil that I absolutely love. Its been over a year and a half now since I bought this, and I'm still buying and using HSI's argan oil because of the way it works so well with this straightener to make my hair shine (plus I love the smell).I would definitely recommend this straightener! 5/5 stars",5
"I bought this straightener because my Chi I've had for 7 yrs finally kicked the bucked. I didn't really have the money to spend $100 on another having just got back from vacation so I starting looking for a cheaper option. Having read the reviews on this and for only $39.99 I thought I'd give it a try. I am so pleased! It works just as good as my Chi did !! And let me just say I have curly, thick, frizzy hair normally ! And I didn't have to spend $100!",5
"This straightener is the best one I've ever owned! Absolutely cannot live without it.  It's very powerful even at a low setting - which keeps my hair damage-free. And it works perfectly to curl, too!",5
"I am really really impressed with this hair iron. I thought i was getting a little thing for this amount of money, but I actually find myself recommending this product to all my friends with frizzy hair! Not only does this iron straighten curls and waves, it rids the hair of frizz and flyaways.I like to use this for my bangs, it gives them a shine that lasts all day long, and there are no frizzy pieces! I also love the way it has a temp control, for if you have thinner hair like me you won't burn anything out. I compared this to the HerStyler, and found they are very similar, but this one had a better price tag. Go with HSI.This iron also comes with a warranty on hsi website, where you can sign up and register yours.I'm giving this a five star rating because it exceeded my expectations, and it heats up quickly, it's efficient and very reasonably priced here on amazon. I think it's more expensive if you buy from their own site.Good luck!",5
"Good product, should have bought the more expensive one though . I'm not used to this dial for the temperature settings, seems kind of old school",4
"I am very happy with this flatiron.  I had been wanting to purchase for awhile but through HSI the flatiron was triple the price.  Amazon had it on sale for $49 and with free shipping I couldn't beat it.  It is all that was promised.  I think it is very good quality and to my surprise, it came with a FREE storage bag AND a sample of the Argon Oil.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  I highly recommend this flatiron to everyone.  THANKS for the GREAT DEAL AMAZON!!!!",5
Was not sure about this product since I had never heard of it before but over 3000+ positive reviews can't be wrong. Its a great product at a great price. I have thick hair with lots of volume but this flat iron leaves my hair shiny smooth and bouncy. Love itPlus delivery from Blue Novelties was super quick.,5
heats up fast and straightens in a short time. speeds up morning routine. glad I found this deal and didn't go for higher priced irons that will do the same job.,5
This iron works much better than my daughter's Chi. One pass and the cuticle is sealed - giving your hair a silky look with no split ends. Amazing price from this seller!,5
"While searching for a flat iron, I always came back to this one so I decided to order it.  I'm so glad I did, it's an awesome product!!  Heats up great, runs through the hair smoothly and leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy.  And....a value!!  I'm a thrifty shopper so believe me when I say..u won't find a better deal for a quality product.",5
"I have fine hair, and often flat irons just kink it and don't give me any body. This HSI is amazing! With the curved edges, I can use it for curling or straightening. I used to use several irons with my straighter, now I use one tool for my hair, this one! It doesn't fry my hair, and the style and even waves/curls last all day long. Best purchase I've made for a styling tool. I haven't tried the oil in my hair yet, as with fine hair, it can be a challenge, but I use the oil on my tattoos and on my face for moisturizing.UPDATE: I tried the Argon oil and it worked nicely on my fine hair without making it all limp and sad. Just don't use too much!",5
I bought this for my girlfriend as a Xmas present she loves it and i also noticed her hair has never been that soft after using a straightener before and not to mention how fast she straightens  her hair now and the little bottle of oil it comes with really works too she loves it so much i just had to buy her a bigger bottle of it. For the price this straightener works great better than her old $300 straightener,5
"This is the BEST flat iron I've ever used! It doesn't dry my hair out or seem to create heat damage. It's very effective at straightening a section of hair with only 1 to 2 ""runs"" over that section of hair. I'm VERY pleased with this product & recommend to everyone.",5
"My 11 year old granddaughter (who is very particular about her hair!) wanted a hair straightener for Christmas.  After doing much on-line research and asking around, I found the HSI was the best value on the market.  So I ordered it from Amazon (while holding my breath).  Well, she thinks it is awesome so as long as it hold up, we are good!",5
"For the price, this hot iron is great. It heats up quickly and does the job. My only issue is that half the time, I have to push the red button on the wall plug because it will pop put and I am unaware until I go to use the iron and it is off.",4
I was using an instyler and my hair is very thick and curly. I could never get my hair to lay flat before using the HSI straightener. It works fabulously. It heats up hot enough to get my crazy curly hair straight. Even problem area in the past are straight and flat. I highly recommend this for the value and quality. ;),5
got it on time a great price and my daughter was thrilled with it i couldnt buy anything close to that for the price,5
"This iron works so quickly. It literally takes 1/4 the time the Conair model we had. I use it on my daughter and she loves the smoothness her hair has after, and it takes a fraction of the time. And for a 7 year old, that is a big deal! I would recommend this product to everyone. It's great!",5
Girlfreind loves it..she bought the hsi argan oil and it makes her dry and brittle hair look shiny and healthy...,5
"I got the HSI flat iron for my daughter for Christmas after reading all the reviews and the product rating. All I can say my daughter loves this flat iron. It makes her hair extremely straight and looks bouncey (FYI, she is mixed.). I also appreciate the fact that it came with argan oil to protect hair, as well as, glove for holding iron. Highly recommend product.",5
top notch stuffgreat for my nappy head lolit straightened it to perfection not hard n wrinkly last all day,4
"Loooove this straightener. The amount of 5 star reviews compelled me to buy it (plus $34 for a straightener isn't a bad price) and I'm very glad I did. I noticed right away that my hair gets straight with just one try, compared to my old straighter, a Sedu, where I often had to go back and straighten sections of hair.I use this along with BioSilk and it's amazing. I definitely recommend using BioSilk with it because it will make your hair look so shiny and mine stays straight overnight. Very glad I decided to purchase this.",5
Bought as a gift - great price and my friend loves it! Would definitely buy for myself. Five stars for sure.,5
"I bought this hair straightener for my girlfriend since hers broke and she absolutely loves it. Since getting it she straightens her hair all the time now and is always thanking me for it. And the service was fantastic. I had it gift wrapped and shipped to her house and it actually arrived about a week early. Overall, i am a very happy customer with a very happy girlfriend",5
"I think this is an excellent flat iron! I've never owned any high end flat irons (like the ones from CHI) before so I can't compare this to those but this is definitely way better then the flat irons from drugstore brands like Conair and Revlon (even the ones that also claim to be ceramic). And it's not that much more expensive then the ones you get from the drugstore so I'd consider this a much more worthwhile investment. My old ""ceramic"" flat irons would leave my hair shiny right after I straighten it but the next day my hair would be incredibly dry and brittle. I've had this HSI flat iron for around a month now and have been using it pretty regularly and that has not happened yet with this flat iron. I also like the temperature range this flat iron has, 140-410. It's nice since I have naturally fine, straight hair that occasionally gets a little wavy from being slept on or tied up so I like to use a lower heat setting (around 200) so that my hair doesn't get too damaged. But I can also turn up the heat when I want to curl my hair (usually to around 300) and it has a swivel cord so I never have to worry about the wires tangling up together. Overall this is a great flat iron and I highly recommend it!",5
"This flat iron is great!  It does straighten my hair quickly.  It leaves my hair shiny and smooth.  I only wish it was just a few degrees hotter.  I do however recommend it.  It is a great product, especially for the price.",5
"I purchased this because I have uneven wavy hair, parts of my hair are really wavy while other areas are straight.  Instead of straightening it with a brush and blow dryer, I opted for this.  I didn't want to buy the larger size flat iron because of the weight while holding it.  My sister has a bigger iron but it takes the same amount of time to striaghten your hair properly.  She prefers this one over the one she has.  This also had a free sample of hair lotion, wasn't enough for my whole head of hair since my hair is around my waist. I used it around my bangs and it actually does give some kind of healthy shine to it.  Also include is a travel pouch. I was quite surprised on the quality of the flat iron. The plastic is more rubberized and easy to grip without worrying you will drop it.  It didn't run hot when I had it on the highest setting, not that I could feel.  I looked at the iron plates and it didn't leave stains from the use of the oil like other flat irons.  I haven't had it that long so I can't really comment on the durability or how long it will last.  But I figure it would last longer than I expect because of the quality of the material used to make it.  If you have Long hair, curly hair, thick, coarse or combination - expect to take some time doing your hair properly.  I forgot to mention that the on/off button and heat controls are on the inside of the handle so you don't have to worry about accident settings change.  A drawback is if you have larger hands, you could burn yourself accidentally if you are not careful but the controls are distanced far enough from the plates that I wasn't too worried.",5
"I couldn't be happier with this flat iron.  It heats up quickly, has a temperature control too.  It's a bit heavier than my old CHI, but not so much that it made a difference.  Great product.  I'm happy I ordered it.",5
"I am usually a no-muss, no-fuss kind of person.  My hair is is in a ponytail at least 6 days a week - purely out of laziness.  But I bought this on a whim because of those occasional days I want to do my hair.  It is sooo easy to use and my hair is done quickly.  My hair is long (mid-back), wavy, and of average thickness.  It takes me only about 10 minutes to straighten it out - and it stays straight all day.",5
Great product. Exactly what is listed. Wanted a dual voltage appliance to be used abroad (Paris) & it worked just fine. Definitely recommend.,5
"I've never bought an expensive straightener before and wasn't sure which brand or style to go with. I'm glad I came across this one and after reading reviews I was convinced. It's easy to use, fast, and gives amazing results. I would recommend this to anyone!",5
"Love this flat iron.  It's everything that's promised. My hair is very curly, it works great, very quick and my hair stays straight until wet.Excellent value for the money.",5
"I recently purchased the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch from Blue Novelties. I LOVE this straightener!! I have had a CHI straightener and ProLiss, but this one is by far the best I have owned. I like that there is a dial with the degrees on it and I can set it to the temperature I need. I also was impressed with the storage pouch that came with the straightener. This is a great product that you can buy with confidence!",5
"""I am new to the Hair Straightner business. I have just let my hair grow long enough to use a Hair Straightner. I read all the reviews of this and many other straightners, this certainly lives up to it's great reviews! It was shipped quickly and works just as described! I am very pleased with this straightner especially the price!! Do not hesitate to purchase this straightner!""",5
My old Flat Iron recently quit working and I was wanting a new one with great reviews but affordable. I found this one on Amazon and I am so glad that I did. It is not as wide as my old one but it gets hotter so the width doesn't make a difference. I am very happy with my purchase. I have long thick curly hair and I am able to straighten it in a reasonable amount of time with this flat iron.,5
"I purchased HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch, after having used old-fashioned curlers, electric curlers and a curling iron for the past 40 years. My daughter, whom I was visiting in Utah, decided that she needed to fix my hair for a party we were going to with her husband's whole family. I thought that all those things did was straighten hair and my hair is already poker straight. But she convinced me that she would do a good job. She was so right! It took her, at the most, 5 minutes to fix my hair and make it look better than it had in the past 20 years. When I left to go home, I forgot to take my curling iron with me. So I went online to look for a Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron, because she told me that was the best kind to get and would give me the best results. I found one on Amazon's Marketplace, Blue Novelties, for a ridiculously low price. I don't know why it was so deeply discounted because it was obvious that it was a top-of-the-line product. It came with a velvet sleeve for travel and a special glove you could wear to keep from getting burned (I guess). I've never had to use it. It's now so fast and easy to fix my hair that I don't view it as the chore I used to. It gave my hair some bounce, some curl, and make it very shiny. I would recommend this item to everybody! If your current hair curler goes bad, get the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch. You won't be sorry!",5
"I had owned and used the same CHI iron for almost 11 years when it finally was damaged (in my luggage) beyond further use. I immediately started looking to replace it with another CHI when I came across the HSI styler. The price was attracitve and I figured if it didn't work out, I wouldn't have wasted too much money before buying another CHI. The HSI styler came on time and was packaged very well. I like the red cloth bag it came in for storing. The styler feels sturdy, heats up quickly and does the job very well, leaving my hair just as straight and smooth as my old CHI. I am satisfied with the results and if it lasts even half as long as my old (beloved) CHI iron, it will have been money well spent.",4
A couple of things i like about the HSI Ceramic flat iron.  I like how you can adjust the temperature for the type of hair you have and Also like that it takes a shorter time for me to straighten my hair with this flat iron then it did with my Chi that i replaced.Over all i really like this product.,4
I love this product!!! Ladies if you have natural hair your hair will look like you just got a relaxer! I went to my beautician to get a sew in and she gasp and asked me if I got a relaxer. Nope I said just a new flat iron :). I may do a video review I could not find any for natural 4b hair. It really works!!!!!,5
"The HSI straightner works great on my thick curly hair. My only concern is that sometimes when I plug it in, I have to push the reset button on the power source a few times for it to turn on. It doesn't seem to be an issue with the outlet. Overall, this is a minor issue, and the straightner works great. A great value!",4
"Me = white girl with a fro. Seriously though, my hair is super thick and I have a LOT of it. I will never have to worry about balding. When I get my hair done, other clients always say, ""Will you give me some?"" I would gladly but I can't. I'm stuck with it. I have spent days looking for straighteners. I have compared and researched on many different web sites. I am an Amazon fanatic so I figured I would try the HSI straightener.I am THRILLED with the straightener. My hair looks good and I get compliments. It is also amazing at curling. It's super easy to make curls. I haven't had to re straighten my hair in a week. My hair doesn't get oily so I'm lucky in that sense. The curls have stayed for at least 3 days. I haven't counted. I always use an oil sheen/heat protector before I began straightening to make my hair even straighter.It also heats up in under a minute. The price is definitely right.This straightener comes highly recommended!!!!",5
"I love the new HSI Flat Iron!!! It works great, and I'am very pleased with my purchase. It doesnt feel like its damaging my hair like so many of the products out there. Would recommend this product to anyone.",5
"I love this flat iron! I have own many flat irons and I find that this one is very similar to my very first purple flat iron ""herstyler"" which I paid about $150 for at the mall kiosk years ago =(! I dropped it so many times that it finally broke so had to get something new.  I'm SOOO glad I was able to get this at a good price!  It leaves my hair smooth and shiny! The argon oil is amazing as well!! I will have to get some more once I am done with the sample =D Thank you!!!",5
This ionic flat iron is a great buy--retails for about 5 times the Amazon price & really does the job!  Easy to hold & the open & close action is very smooth & controllable.  Comes with a nice case & heat glove as well as a small sample of argan oil.  Very impressed so far with the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener!,5
"I received my HSI flatiron from amazon yesterday and couldn't wait to try it out. . My hair is natural no relaxer and with the use of the fantasia straightening serum and argon oil, I was able to combat Virginia's humidity. My hair is smooth, straight, silky, and more importantly protected from heat and the sun. I love this flat iron! With other irons my ends were left frizzy leading me to believe I had split ends.The HSI smoothed my ends and gave my hair lots of body without the fried burnt hair smell.",5
"I bought the ""HSI 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER"" to replace my ""Remington Wet 2 Straight"" flat iron. The Remington one worked *okay*, but I was never able to get salon quality hair from it. I have used the HSI flat iron now 3x, and my hair is looking very straight, silky and shiny. (I use it along with Argan Oil) I am happy with my purchase. -- My only complaint is that it takes a few min to get fully hot, and then has to re-heat itself to max temp every few minutes.",4
"I bought this a few weeks ago for a trip to Europe (Germany/Switzerland). I checked it out first on US current and it worked great. Comes in an awesome red silk puffy packing sleeve, which was great for my suitcase. Used it in both Germany and Switzerland; worked fantastic in both places. All you need is a plug adapter for those countries so that the plug will fit into the socket. I totally recommend this for anyone who needs dual voltage.",5
I have naturally curly hair and I have to buy a new straightener about every 2 years. I have purchased all different brands and none have compared to this straightener. The price is amazing. I have spent 4 times this amount on other straighteners and not gotten the result that I get when I use this flat iron. When I use it my hair is straight and it stays that way regardless of humidity. I can sleep on it and it stays straight as well. I am a huge fan of this product and highly recommend it to anyone that has curly or frizzy hair.,5
I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AFTER TRYING SEVERAL STORE BOUGHT. I HAVE TO SAY THIS ONE HAS WORKED BETTER FOR ME.,5
"I was worried that all the positive reviews were only because the price was so discounted (Originally priced at $200). I am glad to say the reviews are because the HSI ceramic flat iron works pretty darn well. It does a good job straightening and flipping my hair (haven't tried curling with it) and maintains heat well.Pros: It heats quickly and reheats very frequently. It has a good weight and construction. Wide heat range to select from.Cons: The biggest issue I have with this flat iron is its diamond pattern on the grip. It can be pretty uncomfortable to press into it when you hold the iron close. I also wish it had an auto off.Overall, it's a good flat iron.",4
My husband got this for me and I am very happy with it.  It leaves my hair smooth and silky. I highly recommend it. i found it online and I can't believe the price definitely worth it.,5
"I purchased this flat iron with hopes of having beautiful, silky hair. Well, I have definitely had better flat irons than this. I gave it 3 stars because it will straighten your hair...I just see fly aways to the extreme and am disappointed. I was also looking for something that made my hair flatter...and this doesn't cut it. Like I said, I've had some that do, and this isn't it. It may really work for some people, just not for me.",3
"I have very thick, wavy, long hair, and straightening just my bangs has previously been a challenge.  This iron works really well, very similar quality as my Chi flat iron, but bonus...it's dual voltage and can go overseas!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it takes a while to cool down.  This wasn't a major issue for me, but for someone who has to do her hair and quickly pack and leave, it might be an issue.  The heat resistant bag was nice and may help if that situation applies to you.  I actually kept the box for the iron as well, as it is quite sturdy and made the trip back and forth to China without crumbling in my packed luggage.  Overall, if I didn't already own a Chi, I would have no reason to buy a Chi...the HSI is great and less expensive!",4
"So I have mixed girl hair. It's thick, long, and wild. I was tired of spending money on the expensive Chi. I felt like it was not as good as people said it was. I seen this cheap flat iron and I read the reviews so I decided to make the purchase. I love this flat iron. It usually takes me more than 2 hours to do my hair. With this it took me half of that. I was so happy and my hair looks good too. I would recommend this to everyone.",5
"Great product and great customer service.  There was a problem with the first flat iron I received but once I notified the seller, I received a new one a day later.",5
This hair straightener is ok don't see what the big deal is ..it works as good as any straighener i ever had,3
"Don't know why this wasn't invented years ago, or if it was, why it took me so long to find it. Protects your hand when using a curling iron and only interferes with dexterity a tiny bit. It is a knit of some sort, and stretchy. This one is ""one size fits all"" but if they are made in sizes for a better fit, it would be 5 stars. Now, if someone would invent something for my forehead, I would be a happy duck,",4
"My order came with a small sample bottle of argan oil, which I loved, and a glove. I received the order sooner than expected. In regards to the actual product, the only issue I have with it is the heat. I have to use it at 400 F degrees (maximum heat setting) which I hate because I know the damage it's doing to my hair but it becomes more difficult to straighten my hair if I use it on a lower heat setting. I have 'Kerri Russell' hair so it's not really hard to straighten just very tedious. I was using a herstyler straightening iron before switching to this one and I could set the temperature close to the lowest heat setting and it would get the job done. I feel like this iron doesn't get as hot as other irons I have used in the past which may be a good or bad thing but despite having to use it on the highest heat setting it is functional. Also, I chose this iron because when I did a search for it, it came up as a tourmaline ceramic iron , but nowhere in the packaging does the word 'tourmaline' come up. So I think it really just is a ceramic iron. Overall it's an okay product but I was content with how well the shipper or distributor of this product delivered.",3
"Works similiar to store brands, but couldn't beat the price.  The only complaint that I have it that it snags my hair.",4
"It works great- heats up quickly and moves through hair smoothly.  I love it, I have wavy hair and it straightens my hair great, definitely recommend!",5
"I've tried many different straighteners before and I absolutely adore this one. For the price, I can guarantee this is the BEST straightener on the market. Of course there are better straighteners out there, but they cost over $100.I would definitely recommend this straightener. Mine came broken (one plate would not heart up) but Amazon (love them) sent me a new one without question!Ah straight hair :3",5
"The HSI Professional flat iron is, I think, just as good or better than the Chi.  It left my very curly hair silky and smooth.  I liked that you don't get burned by the handle like some other flat irons.",5
I received this flat iron hair straightener about a week ago and am very satisfied with this purchase. The packaging was very nice and I like that you can adjust the temperature of this iron. Considering that these types of straighteners can be pretty expensive I think this is a very good value for the price and would highly recommend this product.,5
"I have thick curly hair and this flat iron does the trick. Heats up fast, temp adjusts well, very satisfied",5
"I researched alot of flat irons before making the decision to purchase this one. In my opinion, this iron gives you the best value for your dollars.  It's just as good as the more pricey ones, and in some ways even better.  It comes with a nice drawstring pouch, that you can use for carrying or storage - a nice touch.  It looks sleek and stylish, heats up quick and evenly.  Nice product, I'm very happy with this purchase.",4
She loves it - her hair looks great and she is spending less time making it look better than ever with this iron.  Extremely please with the purchase and fast shipping!!,5
It came early!!! Also came in a nice pouch with a glove and oil!!! Awesome product leaves my really curly hair like if I did a keratin treatment!! Love it,5
"These ceramic stylers are a great improvment on my old stylers, my hair slides through the plates a lot easier and the finished result is better and easier to achieve. Excellent product",5
"This is a MUST HAVE so you can give it to your girlfriend/wife. It's way better than a blower, and it gets hot IN 2 SECONDS!!",5
This straightener is great! It left my hair very soft and sleek. It heats up very quickly and there is an indicator light showing when it is hot (light turns green). I just noticed the light this morning and it's helpful so you know when the straightener is ready.,5
This Hair Iron is made with great quality and does a good job.  It is definitely worth the $39.99 I paid for it.,5
"I admit this is only my second straightener, but I love this one. It straightened my hair in half the time it would normally take and it stayed smooth! Amazing! The price was also great.",5
I have used CHI in the past and decided to try this product since both of my CHI's quit working. This product does a great job on my hair.,5
"I was very impressed with this strightener! Hot in seconds. Leaves brilliant results and leaves the hair shiny for days. Being a hairdresser, this is really helping me achieve the results I want and I'm getting an excellent response from all my clients! Highly recommend this product.",5
"Received this product within 2 days after ordering!  This is the first time I've ever used a flat iron on my hair since my hair is poker straight as it is.  After being told it doesn't matter if you have poker straight hair, a flat iron can do multiple things & makes your poker straight hair stylish.....I thought I'd give it a try!  I tried it the first night of receiving the item....without using the oil that comes with it, I LOVED IT!!!!  You can pull your ends under (the look you get after blow drying your hair out), you can spiral curl your hair or even a light curl (any curl for that matter), or just straight up straighten all strands!  I'm not one that likes to spend time on my hair....I'm a throw up & go type of girl, but after seeing the results this flat iron can do....I don't mind spending that extra time on my hair!  Since this is my first time using a flat iron, I can't comment on the flaws a general flat iron does have (like the changes in temperature when it's on, etc.).  I could give or take the auto off timer option on them since all I do is put it on my ceramic sink after I'm done with it (unplugged, of course) to let it cool off, but I close my bathroom door so my cats don't get burnt....my daughter doesn't bother with that bathroom so no concern there!  But all in all.....in my opinion, this is worth the money!",5
"This is  a good, easy to use flat iron. I love using it, makes my hair silky and does a great job on straightening or even curling my hair. Nice carry bag comes with it, and a small bottle of Argon oil. Definitely worth the purchase.",5
"We've tried several straightners, to cover three girls of different types of hair, they have all been returned.  So far, the HSI has been doing a fabulous job!!  Well, worth the purchase!",4
Great value for an amazing product. It heats up very quick and straightens my hair beautifully. I love the little kit it comes with.,5
"I have a short bob and I was looking for a good 1 inch flat iron for less than $100. This one had good reviews and I am very happy with it. Extras included in the box are a heat glove and an argon oil sample. Great deal, great flat iron.",5
I like this straightener. Good price. Doesn't pull my hair like my other one!  I also like the 1 inch.,5
"I've had the straightener for a few weeks now and I love it! I had a chi before and it lasted me a good four years but I didn't want to buy another because it was so expensive. This straightener works just as well,it was very cheap and it came with argan oil! I highly recommend!",5
It's okay my hair is really curly. I have to go over it 3 to 4 time it get it straight but I'll use it.,3
"I am not really sure how I feel about this flat iron yet, I have used it a total of about 3 times already. Overall though I wouldn't say the purchase was a waste of time or anything. I am a Black American with natural 4b hair. I suppose it straightens it very well, for the most part I think it is just because I am not pleased with the products that I use along with it. We'll see when I get a better hang of straightening my natural hair.",3
This product heats up quickly. It straightens both my curly hair and my daughter's very curly hair with ease. I like the red case it comes with and the adjustable heat setting. Very pleased.,5
Love this product!!  If you have dry damaged hair like myself or very thick hair like my daughter then you need this flat iron.  We've used other flat irons before but this is a miracle product.  Our hair has never been so straight and shiny.  Warning though...it makes your hair extremely hot right after using the flat iron.,5
"I have thin hair, but a LOT of it that has random kinks and waves in the back that are surprisingly hard to tame for someone who has ""straight"" hair. After cutting it off a few months ago I had so many more problems, so I began the quest of trying to find a new straightener. It's not too bulky, gets hot fairly quickly, and doesn't singe or burn my hair. I use a little dab of argan hair oil and it works well with the straightener. Doesn't take me forever to get through my layers and layers of hair, but at the same time doesn't damage the more fragile hair around my face. Better than more expensive irons I tried out before settling on this one!",4
"Great straightener! It heats up quickly and keeps my wavy hair straight all day. I would  recommend it. The only down fall is the on/off button is on the inside which makes it a little awkward, but all in all it's a great purchase.",5
I needed to replace my straightener that was broken in my luggage on a recent trip. I went to Amazon first since they always have so many options. I went with the HSI for two reasons first the amount of positive reviews it received and the price. It was delivered much faster than I expected which was great and also came with a sample bottle of Argon oil. The straightener heats up quickly and glides smoothly through my hair so I can get my hair done in no time at all. I must say that using this iron along with the oil has kept my hair straight and no more frizz!! Even with going out in the rain my hair stayed straight usually if it gets a little wet it gets curly and frizzy. I love this iron so much that I am going to buy another one for myself as a backup and order one for my daughter as well to replace her Chi since this one is so much nicer. The only con is that there is not an on light so you just have to make sure you turn it off or unplug it.,5
"I am absolutely in LOVE with my HSI Flat Iron! I noticed the difference from my old, other brand right away. My hair is silky straight! Looks like I just left the salon and I got compliments on my hair right away. Lovin' it!",5
I purchase the HSI Cermaic flat iron after researching flat iron for african american's with naturally thick hair. This product is the best thing since slice bread. I would recommend this to anyone with thick hair. Long as you part your hair in small section you will have fabulos results. I love the flat iron.,5
"I was very pleased with my HSI The Styler Straightener.  I have thick, wavy hair and this straightener worked wonders on my hair.  I also tried the sample HSI Argan oil that came with the product and loved that too!  My husband has been telling me how beautiful my hair looks ever since I started using this straightener.  Great price, great product and fast shipping!",5
"I have thick curly/wavy, long hair and I was able to straighten my hair in less than an hour. It usually takes me about 50 minutes to an hour. The products works really well and definitely good for the cheap price.",4
"I AM PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT, MY HAIR FEELS SILKY AND THE FLAT IRON HAS A BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN SET THE TEMPERATURE (LOW, MEDIUM OR HIGH) THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU HAIR. I HAVE A CHI IRON BUT SINCE I GOT THIS ONE...IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE BEEN USED. I LOVE IT!!",5
"I used to have a much bigger flat iron, which was hard to use.  This one is a nice, smaller size and lets me get closer to the roots.  I like that they include the glove.  I never would have thought of using a glove, but it's great to have some protection from the heat, especially when I'm doing the back.",5
This product far exceeded my expectation.  I love this product and it straightens my hair like no other flat iron.  If you are having problems with frizzy or curly hair and want it straight--BUY THIS PRODUCT!!  You will be glad you did.  Not only did this product leave my hair wonderfully straight but it added shine and left my hair silky soft.  It does not burn the hair but straightens it leaving it fabulously silky soft.,5
bought this looking at other reviews. I must say I am very happy with the ease it straightens and for the time it saves!! Totally worth the price and the deal on amazon..,4
"I purchased this straightener after my beloved Sedu was essentially split in two by my 6 year old. I had spent over $100 on the previous purchase and was not very happy about spending that amount again. After looking at this product and reading the reviews I figured that, for the price, I would risk it (at the time it was about $40). WOW! Am I ever happy that I did. This flat iron is fantastic. It heats up quickly and keeps a steady temp.  Also, it doesn't snag my hair, which was an issue for me with the previous product I owned. I also like that I received the heat resistant glove with this product, as I can now try some other styles, not just using my straightener but also with curling irons.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this. It was a great purchase!",5
"There were many things to like about the HSI Flat Iron.  First, the dial which allows the user to control temperature up to 410 degrees is helpful for those who are concerned with avoiding unnecessarily high temperatures, especially those with fine hair or dry hair, who don't want exposure to more heat than necessary to get that sleek look.  I found that I used the HSI at the 410-degree setting.  Second, the light which indicates when the iron is ready to use is conveniently located on the outside where it's easier to see than on other types of irons where it's located inside.  This is helpful for safety reason as it is easier to spot the light on the outside to check that the unit is off.  Third, the indicator light shines red while heating and turns green when ready; couldn't be easier.  And finally, I like the sleek black look of the unit and the design of the grip.  I would buy the HSI again if I had it to do over.The item arrived quickly and well-packed.  And the seller was very concerned I was happy with the purchase--all-in-all a very favorable experience.",5
"I am very pleased w/ this professional flatiron.  I like that I can control the temperature.  The construction seems quite durable and has a fuss-free swivel cord.  Compared to other irons I've handled, this one is on the heavier side but it doesn't hinder its performance. Nicely packaged as it includes a nice velvet storage bag, a small bottle of argon oil, and protective glove.  Includes a one year mfg warranty.  I really cannot think of anything else I would want in an iron.  Thanks, HSI!",4
"I originally saw this product at a kiosk in a mall over a year ago retailing for $120. The promoter gave me a free demonstration and it worked instantly. It was quick to heat up and straightened my hair in seconds!I have quite long coarse hair (about 30"" worth), and plenty of it! My hair is naturally wavy when its wet. Upon hearing this the promoter had wet my hair with a spray bottle and sure enough it began to wave and curl slightly. While he brushed my hair, he turned on the iron and it heated up very quickly. A couple of quick strokes and voila! straight hair! The promoter also showed me that a slower stroke would yield the same results. Amazingly, my hair was actually softer and smoother (iron must be emitting negative ions too).Now for the nitty gritty.The straightener is made of 1"" plates with a ceramic tourmaline coating, which allows the plates to glide more smoothly over hair strands and provides better heat transfer and more consistent temperatures.The iron has heats ranges from 240-410 degrees fahrenheit, accommodating a wide range of hair types (coarse hair requires more heat while damaged hair requires lower temperatures).The handle and outer casing is made of plastic, and while less durable, gives benefits in less weight and less heat transfer, keeping the heat where it needs to be. The handle is textured providing a little more grip and is comfortable to hold and manoeuvre weighing at just over one pound.Another nice feature is the swivel cord, which prevents tangles and twists both when you're using it or storing it. Like all hair appliances should, the cord also has a breaker at the end to prevent huge surges that may trip your breaker and/or damage the product itself.The only downfall so far to this product is that it does not have a auto shut off timer (I believe the Turbo model with the LCD display does).But despite this, it's a great appliance for under $50 and easily beats out the others on the market! I cannot speak on durability as I've only had this for only a couple of months, but so far so good (cross your fingers!).",5
"Honestly, by far these are the best flat irons I've ever had..I really loved how good they straightened and curled..they gave me beautiful curls and when I wanted my hair straight it straightened right up..they didnt burn my hair or leave that burnt smell..I plan on purchasing from them in the future..and i received my item in two days..",5
"This product is great - a lot of the reviews suggested that there are knockoffs out there, but I don't believe this one is! It's heavy duty, and came in great packaging, etc. I have SUPER thick and wavy hair. It does a great job in one pass! Couldn't beat this for the price.",5
"After reading reviews on several flat irons (feeling that I needed a new one because I'd had mine about 10 years), I bought this one.  For the price, it's a good product.  I feel that my previous flat iron, a Corioliss, got hotter... but all and all I'm happy and would recommend.  I normally write longer reviews, but with a flat iron, I feel there are only 3 responses:  1)  It's too hot or defective, and burned my hair.  I'm so mad that I want to freak out.  2)  It's amazing and makes me look like a celebrity with next to no effort (I think you'd pay a lot more than $40 for that response).  or 3) It's a good product, but nothing amazing.  The final response is mine.  :)  I hope it was helpful.  :)",4
"I just purchased this flat iron and its fabulous. I have fine hair and other flat iron burns it really bad but with this I put it on medium heat, my hair doesn't even feel hot but it straighten it really good and it stays nice and soft. I have chi which is nice but hsi is much better. I tried the new advertised coolway and I hated it. This is the best fat iron ever. If any one is looking for flat iron this is it.",5
"My HSI flat iron is such an improvement from my last flatiron. Not only is my hair even more silky and smooth, it takes half the time to get the results that I am looking for! The iron heats up in approximately 20-30 seconds, has the ability to heat up to 410 degrees, and gives my thick hair a smooth and silky shine. Couldn't be happier.",4
"I bought the HSI styler as the price was a bargain that I could not afford to miss.I was impressed as it came in its box wrapped in a silky red pouch, a glove so you don't burn yourself and a mini bottle of oil. I had to purchase a plug adapter as the plug is euro. I was amazed at how quickly it straightened my hair and didn't give off a burning smell as you would normally get with some straighteners. It has a temperature dial so you can adjust it to the suitability of how thick your hair is.My hair felt smooth and silky and I received many compliments. My hair is long and wavy and thick however it took me 10 minutes to do my whole head. I'm happy with my purchase.",5
I truly love this flat iron!! I'm a black woman with relaxed hair and this flat iron completely straightens my new growth and helps me extend the time before my next trip to the salon. It also makes my hair feel extremely soft and silky. Like I said this flat iron is a box full of AWESOMENESS and completely worth the money spent!!,5
I received my HSI iron yesterday and used it last night.  I admit I was a bit skeptical because of the marked down price but it is the real deal.  I have had a CHI and my last iron was an FHI.  This iron straighten my has just as good for 3 times less the price.  I am considering buying another for a Christmas gift!,5
"Awesome product, works great on my hair!  So glad I purchaed it, I can definitely tell a difference in my since I started using it.",5
"I purchased this to replace an old CHI 1"" flat iron that I had for about 5 years. I was a little worried when it felt lighter then my previous flat iron, but  was impressed by how well it handled. I have very thick wavy hair and the HSI flat iron did the trick. I love that I can adjust the heat. Just be patient during warm ups or cool downs when changing temps for different sections of hair. This product is spot on.  Also love the travel bag that was included.",5
"I was using a CHI before switching to this straightener (I only bought it because of the awesome price & the great reviews).  I'm so glad that I bought it, I love it much more than my CHI!  :)",5
"Since moving to a humid climate, my hair has been uncontrollable.  Tired of having to wear it in a bun, I decided to try this HSI flat iron.  It's simple to use and seems to be well-made.  It was effective in taking out the frizz/curls, but if your hair is at all dry, as mine is, I wouldn't use it every day.  Make sure you also use some argan oil or coconut oil to help keep your hair in good condition.",4
"I bought the straightener after reading the other reviews. And I am more than satisfied.It heats up quickly, and even with the middle heat you just need to go over every region just once, which is a lot healthier for your hair.The straightening lasts longer than with my other straightener.All in all I am very happy that I got this one and can highly recommend it.",5
"I bought this flat iron from Blue Novelties, fulfilled by Amazon. Great customer services...now to the product, it works wonderfully. It leaves my hair shinny and looking healthy, some other flat irons I owned made me look like Lion King. It heats fairly quick and even though the plates are narrow you can handle it with no problem at all.I've owned this flat iron for two months now and judging by results I would definitely recommend it to all the girls out there that sometimes need a little help with straightening out wild curls. My best flat iron so far. *.*",5
I think so! I was amazed at how shiny and frizz-free my hair was. And this is only with passing the iron only once through my hair? And thanks fir the sample of Argan oil. It smells wonderful.,5
I've always bought my straightners cheap and thought the mediocre results were just the by product if my thick long hair.  Then I had tried my friends chi straightener and realized I didn't have to settle!  After looking up before mentioned straightener on amazon I realized that this straightener had better reviews and was more in my budget so I gave it a try. I'm so happy I made this purchase. It takes me 10-20 minutes to do my think waist length hair where it was taking me near an hour to do it with drug store straighteners (revlon anyone?). LOVE THIS. Plus it comes with a glove and a satin bag.  What more could you want! And at this price it's a steal!!,5
"I have never had much luck in using flat irons as I've usually wound up frizzing up my hair and causing endless damage to my ends. As I've just gotten a new bob haircut, I decided to give it another shot and checked out the top rated flat irons on Amazon.  I found the HSI and boy, am I glad I did.First of all, this flat iron has temperature control, which is fantastic if you have curly hair like me. On days I'm going from curly to straight, I can set it near the top (410F) and on touch up mornings, at a lower temperature (300F and below)for maintenance. It heats up quickly and has a long cord.  For those women who travel, this is also one of the only flat irons I've found with these features and dual voltage. You'll still need an adapter, but you'll be able to take it abroad nonetheless.So far, I've used my HSI twice with excellent results. It straightens my hair quickly and the style maintains easily. I'm definitely glad I decided to buy it.",5
"I have very curly thick hair, I've had a chi and I feel this flat iron is the best. I'm so pleased with it also I recieved it in great timing. I love my new flat iron!!!!",5
"Recently my CHI hair straightener decided to sort of ""break"" on me. The last time I tried to use it I noticed that it was barely heating up when I set it on its highest setting. I've had it for a few years so it wasn't too surprising that it was about time for a new one.I spent maybe $80-$90 on my last CHI, so I expected to spend that much on another one. I looked for a CHI but the ones I found were too expensive for my tastes... upwards of $100. I was about to fold when I found this HSI straightener.The price was totally right and the reviews seemed spot on. I was really hesitant because you get what you pay for right? But I figured since it was so cheap I'd give it a go, better than spending $100 or more I didn't really want to spend on a hair straightener.The HSI came super fast (thank you 1-day shipping Amazon!) and I opened it up. Came with a nice silky case, a glove... thing, some solution for hair, instructions etc etc.  I could care less about the glove and hair solution, and I would for the case too but I think I'll actually use it to keep dust and whatever else from getting on the straightener when I'm not using it.Next day I tested it out. Used it just like my CHI, put the heat all the way up. It worked like a dream!! Also, I used my CHI to make some nice curls and flips and things, but I found it hard sometimes because if I didn't do it just right I'd get those very noticeable and awkward ""grooves"" in the hair. I found it much easier to do this ""curling"" with the HSI. Also, I found it much easier to handle than my CHI, which was very bulky and slightly awkward to handle, and somewhat heavy. The HSI is much easier to move between my hands to get at each side of my hair.So I styled my hair, great. Didn't take too long, replicated the effects I got from my CHI. Awesome! I experimented a bit with my hair, and I expected the curls to go away overnight because even after getting beautiful curls on the highest heat with my CHI, the nice wavy hair I'd get would never last more than a day (it'd revert to very flat mostly straight hair). To my surprise when I woke up and looked in the mirror my beautiful curls and waves STAYED!! This was NEVER the case with my CHI, I'd always have to do the process over again to get my hair just the way I liked it.Needless to say I'm EXTREMELY happy with the HSI hair straightener. WAY better value than my CHI, at the time of this review its about $40, which beats that $80 I had to pay for my CHI. Its much better to wield, heats up VERY QUICKLY and gives me curls and wavy hair that STAY OVERNIGHT (I'm pretty ecstatic about this because I didn't think it possible for my curls to stay previously when using my CHI).The HSI is so cheap right now I may even buy another just as a back up and also if the price goes up. I'm sure this is the best hair straightener that I've EVER owned, miles ahead of CHI!! Take it from me you won't be disappointed!!",5
"My first flat iron was big and bulky.  I wanted something more streamline that still worked as well.  HSI does a nice job of straightening my hair and since the heat is adjustable, it's not too hot.  It's also easy to handle.  I love the argan oil that came with it.  The oil is very light and does not weigh down your hair.  It gives it a nice sheen and smells really good.  I really like both products.",5
"I bought this straightener when I broke my CHI. I didn't want to spend over $100 again, so I looked for a cheaper option. After readying all of the good reviews, I settled on HSI even though I've never heard of the brand. I paid only $40 (w/ free shipping), but this straightener works just as well as a CHI. It is well made, doesn't feel cheap, and it gets the job done. I always thought the CHI products were overpriced, now I know for sure. I would definitely buy HSI again!",5
"Bought for my girlfriend so these are her words:Have used for a couple weeks now and I have to say this is an excellent product that came with a nice accessory package - hest resistant glove, Argan hair oil and a very nice drawstring pouch. Heats up quickly and works like a charm. Would highly recommend at this price or even twice as much.",5
Bought this as a birthday present for my daughter. She loves it! Great quality and comes with a sample of Argon oil and a nice carrying case.,5
"I formerly had the chi straightener which I loved but left behind accidentally in another state, so I had to buy another one.  I took a chance on this product and have been very happy.  It does a great job at being hot enough (adjustable heat setting)  to straighten my hair, or curl it too.  The price can't be beat either!",5
I straighten my hair every day and have used many different brands - by far this is the best one I have ever owned.,5
I was not sure about purchasing as I had never heard of HSI before. I decided to go ahead after reading the reviews praying they were right. They were! It's wonderful. I can straighten & curl with it. It doesn't pull & gets plenty hot! I love it. I have very Hard To Manage Hair (thick & used to be curly not sure what it is anymore!)Two thumbs UP. If it had 6 stars I would give it one more. =),5
"Started to search for a Chi but purchased HSI based on other reviews and of course the awesome price. So far I am not disappointed. Works great! Works quickly, I do not have to pass through the same hair over & over. Leaves hair nice and shiny provided you use some type of heat protectant but that goes without saying. Definitely would purchase again and I have already recommended to my hairstylist and a few others while sitting in her chair. The only drawback I can see is the plug being too big. I cannot plug it and my dryer in at the same time on the same outlet because they both are the big 'reset' size plugs. But easily solved I just unplug my husband's shaver on another outlet in order to warm the HSI while I dry.",4
So glad I didn't waste over $100 on a Chi or something similar. This straightener is great. Couldn't be happier!,5
"I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter who insisted that she needed a croc hair straightener. After researching online, I discovered this item had the most positive reviews. After trying it out, my daughter agreed. She is thrilled with how quickly it gets the job done. To be as clear as I can, she has long thin hair that is only slightly wavy, but not naturally stick straight.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because she says she has to have the stand because there is no safe way to put the hot iron down on its own. Otherwise, it's great!",4
I recently purchased this item after borrowing my moms. This is by far the best flat iron I've ever purchased. I am very satisfied with this product!,5
"I purchased the HSI Flat Iron after my CHI broke. I have had issues with the last several CHI flat irons I've purchased, so I decided to purchase the HSI after reading the reviews. This flat iron does not disappoint! I have curly hair, and can get it completely straight in just 1 or 2 passes. It can be set up to 410 degrees, although I am able to get my hair straight at 380 degrees or less. If you are looking for a less expensive alternative to the CHI brand, look no further. GREAT styling tool!",5
"Excellent flat iron for an excellent price.  Bought it to replace my $300 flat iron and it does just as good a job if not better.  The sample of argan oil that comes with it is great as well.  My hair is really damaged from repeated bleaching and the oil makes my hair so smooth.  I love it and will definitely buy it when it runs out.  I wasn't too sure about the product because I've never heard of the brand, but after reading great reviews I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.  You will too!",5
"Received the flat iron in two days, definitely the best one I've bad thus far. Leaves my frizzy, hard to manage hair silky and oh so soft!",5
"I was a bit concerned, not recognizing the brand, but purchased based on other reviews and good price. Very pleasantly surprised! It came packaged nicely, even the storage pouch is VERY nice quality. Heats up extremely fast and the lower settings are perfect for my fine hair. The styler has a nice weight to it, sensible no slip grips and easy to use. So far, I am impressed. Its a much better product than other stylers I have paid alot more for.",5
Awesome love it!!!!! I had a Remington before  but the hsi blows it out the water it's so much better makes my hair shine and the oil that came with it makes my hair look like I just stepped out of the salon,5
I am so happy with this hair straightener so far. I cannot believe how healthy my hair is after using it!  It really works the way it says it will.,5
"The iron heats up quickly and I don't have to go over the same few spots as many times as I did with my old iron. The only complaint I have is I wish the iron opened a little bit more, but it's really not that bad, it just took some getting used to for me. Another weird thing is if you have it sitting on your counter so you can see the heat adjustment dial, the red/green light indicating that the iron is on would be facing your counter (not visible). I adjust my heat a few times while doing my hair because some of my hair is more unruly than other parts, so I like to have the adjustment readily available, but I also like to see the ""on"" light to know when it's ready, or to ensure I turned it off. So that's a quirky part of the design to me. But over all it's a great iron for the price.",4
"This straightener is top-notch.  Not only is it amazing quality, it is affordable.  I am very pleased with the product and highly recommend it.",5
I love this flat iron!! Seems to be of very high quality. It really is very nice! Heats up really fast and gets HOT! I love it!,5
Its a pretty good flat iron considering the price. Great deal! Works well w my hair and doesnt damage it at all,4
"My wife was took about 2 weeks researching flat irons.  She had mixed reviews about the Chi and Babyliss etc.  I found the HSI and decided why not try it out.  She loves it!  It heats up so fast and gets the job done, especially at the price I bought it.  She is glad I didn't go and spend over $100 for a flat iron because this works just as good.",5
"I'm really glad I purchased this flat iron. For starters, it arrived two days before I expected it! My hair is thin, yet since I've been coloring it for years, it quickly frizzes in humidity. I live in Florida, which is highly humid almost every day. It only takes me about 5 minutes to pass the iron through my hair. It glides very smoothly and leaves my hair perfect! Since it's rounded, I also like that I can flip the bottom under, giving it more body. When I get home in the evening, my hair is still perfect, no matter how much time I've spent outside!The price is unbeatable, and it includes the Argan Oil, a glove, and a beautiful thick travel pouch. What more can anyone ask for!!",5
"This HSI Flat Iron is great!  It gets very hot and straightens my hair perfectly.  I use to have a Chi and would have sworn by it however the plates started pealing and it just didn't seem to be doing as great of a job as it use to.  This flat iron is the perfect size, temperature and look.  My hair is very thick and frizzy and it takes me about 10 minutes to straighten all of my hair.  Also, based on researching others out there this one doesn't even compare with price.  It's such a good deal!",5
I had never heard of this product before but a friend recommended it and I have been very pleased! Thanks so much!,5
"I was so surprised to see the price of it (it's actually supposed to be three hundred dollars!) that I had to buy it right away, and I'm glad I did! It heats up very fast, and for someone with hard-to-straighten hair like me, it does the job with just enough heat as to not harm my hair. :) I had to put my old straightener up on the highest setting, but with this one, somewhere in the middle works! It's lovely.",5
This product was more then worth the buy. I have never shopped online before this was my first time doing so and I am extremely happy I did. This straighter is amazing and very cost affordable. My hair is straight within 30 mins when normally it takes 60 to 90 mins to do. I am very pleased. My advice buy one & try it for yourself!!,5
I use this straightener over my $300.00 straightener everyday. It was a great deal on top of how efficant it is. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone,5
"I hesitated to purchase this but since it was such a good deal, I decided to go ahead and try it. I have only used the Chi flat irons before this. The first one I got, did not heat up all the way, I contacted Amazon and they shipped out a replacement one that same day and I had it the next day. It has worked WONDERFULLY! Like another reviewer, I purchased this to use as my back-up, but now use it as my primary and have my Chi as my backup. My hair does not get caught in the plates and it's so easy to use. Love it!***UPDATE 11/13/12***I have been using my HSI flat iron since I purchased it in August. This past weekend, it fell off the counter in my bathroom and onto my wood floors. Unfortunately, the fall caused one of the plates to break in half so I can no longer use it :( I know this is a possibility with any flat iron but I have also dropped my Chi a few times before (I'm not the most graceful person, especially early in the mornings) and never had this happen. That being said, I think this flat iron is a lot more fragile than the Chi. On a more positive note, since it broke, I pulled my Chi back out and used it. I can DEFINITLY see a difference. The HSI gets much hotter (which I like) and does a much better job faster. It is a bit heavier than the Chi as well but not too much.  All in all, I still recommend this flat iron; just don't drop it like I did.",5
"I tried 2 different straightners from Walmart and they did not work correctly. The hot plates did not go together flush and they just felt cheap. The HSI straightners plates go together flush and it is a very sturdy quality product. I wanted a straightner to curl my hair like my hairdresser does at the salon. This one does the job. I have fine straight hair and my curls last all day, and the curls are a million times better than the curls from a curling iron. I can even sleep on them and have curly hair the next day! This is a great product and I am very satisfied.",5
I have been looking for a good flat iron for some time and have bought several from beauty supply houses that never really worked as well as the one my stylist would use on my hair.  I liked the features of the HSI and decided to give it try.  I have been nothing but pleased with my purchase!  I can create the same styles as my stylist in addition this iron will also curl or flip your hair!  I love it!!!,5
After researching numerous reviews and also asking friend recommendations I chose the HSI Professional. I am extremely happy with this product. It straightens my wavy hair better than any flat iron I have owned. Salon quality!,5
Bought this product as a gift for my wife she loves it. She notice no damage to her hair like other spensive hair straighteners that she had bought. At soon as she started using it she trow away the other ones she had.,5
"I've been looking for a good flat iron but didn't want to spend $100 on a another brand that has a lot of name recognition.  I saw the HSI straightener on Amazon with fantastic reviews and a much more attractive price and decided to give it a try.  I'm sure happy I did!  My hair is about shoulder length, medium thickness, and has random waves at the ends (none in the same direction!).  The flat iron heated up very quickly and I was able to straighten my hair in 5-10 minutes. All those little fly-aways that drive me nuts were nowhere in sight.  I headed out to pick up the kids from school and received many compliments on how great my hair looked!  Several even asked if I just came from the salon.I like that the flat iron has a heat setting so when I do ""beauty shop"" with the kids, I can set it at a lower heat level that's more comfortable for them.  I did not need to use the highest setting - only about 2/3 of the dial (only max number is printed).",5
"I have only used the HSI flat iron a few times, but so far, I really like it.  I am a little disappointed that it doesn't have an automatic shut off though I found out that the HSI flatiron that is coming out next will have that feature.  Also, if you purchase this model, please note that the red light which indicates it is on is on the bottom of the handle and not on the inside where the on/off switch is.  When I turned it on for the first time, I didn't know if it was on or off because there was no red light on, so I touched the inside to check it and got burned (nothing serious, just a quick burn).  Just wanted that to be a FYI.",4
"This straightener is great because it allowed me to have straight hair in little time. I have naturally wavy hair that is super thick, and this product works great. I love the degree settings, the velvet-like case, and the fast shipping. I loved Amazon's price-$42 with shipping. I believed this item originally retailed for $299. It is definitely salon quality, so I feel like I got a great deal- and a great product.",5
"Love this flat iron!  It is hot enough to straighten my thick, coarse, wavy hair.  Also, the sample of Argan oil, wow.  I am totally going to buy some of that when my sample runs out!  Makes my hair shiny, silky and smooth.",5
"Until two weeks ago when I went into my hairdresser looking like I had just flown out of a helicopter, I had no idea what a flat iron was!  I am growing my hair out from being very short, so that it will cover my ears.  It is really curly and I was looking wild.  My hairdresser showed me her flat iron and recommended I get one.  Well, have you ever looked at advertisements for such a product?  There are at least 25 different brands and they all promise something extraordinary.  I am so happy with my HSI ceramic flat iron.  One reason is that it is only one inch wide, which helps me control it - the wide ones would pull up too much hair.  The weight distribution makes it easy to handle.  The best part is the heating element.  It can be turned up so that it is really hot, but with my fine hair, the middle setting is just perfect.  It heats up instantly when it is plugged in.  I also LOVE the bright red soft carry bag that is included, and the Argan oil was a special treat too.  Thank you, HSI, for a fine product.  As usual when I purchase something through Amazon.com, the service was immediate, and the product was more than promised.",5
"Opening the box was an exciting adventure:-Satin Bag with light flee-like material as a liner-The flat iron inside the satin bag-5ml of Argan Hair Oil-A glove (What!!! A glove to protect your hand. Wow. Not sure I'll use it much, but very thoughtful.)I couldn't wait to use the flat iron. The flat iron itself is equipped with:-On/Off button-Dail to increase or decrease the temperature-Indicator light on the side to let you know when its ready or at the set temperatureIt Heats up Quick! And my hair didn't seem to snag like it often did when using my T3.Leaves hair defrizzed and silky smooth and ends didn't seem to feel fried.I was convinced that when I lost my T3 (cost $200) due to a blow up in Barcelona, thatI'd go back and buy another T3. But so far, I'm glad I chose to try something new.",5
"When I was looking for a hair straighter, I was considering CHI as well. But when I gave a shot for this HSI.This straighter works great. It just a few sec your hair will be straight. If you are using everyday, the shorter you will use this to straight.  They packaged great. I would recommend to my friends!",5
"I bought this review about 10 months ago from amazon.  I was very impressed with how fast it was shipped out to me and the packaging was perfect.  The product comes with a carrying case and a very nice glove that is useful when touching the hot hair.  I loved this product from the minute I used it.  I was happy that I bought it based on the user comments and it was a great deal for the purchase price.  I ended up breaking it because it fell from my vanity to the wood floor below and broke, however I wasn't disappointed because it falls a lot of the same desk all the time and must have fallen maybe 5,000 times before finally breaking the one time.  I ordered the same product again from amazon and and still using it just as impressed as with the first one. I have thick natural african american hair and this straighter gets the job done and faster than any other flat iron I've used.",5
I had a CHI flat iron for 6 years. I swore by it. It finally broke and I didn't have $150 to replace it. I read tge reviews on the HSI and decided to give it a try. It is amazing! I will never buy a CHI again!,5
All though all the reviews were good I was skeptical because my hair does not cooperate with flat irons even with a CHI! I was amazed how my frizzy poofy curly hair was transformed into silky smooth straight strands without even blow drying my hair straight! I just brushed my hair and used the flat iron. The argan oil is amazing as well! Just a little goes a very long way and I have very long hair! This flat iron will be my go to flat iron for life! I hope my chi doesn't mind it's going into retirement ;),5
"I have thick, long, curly hair and recently moved to an area where it is ALWAYS humid.  I have tried numerous flat irons (Babyliss, Rusk, Chi) and went to hair stylists to straighten my hair, but as soon as I walked outside it would curl back up.  I wasn't expexting this flat iron to do much but the price seemed reasonable.  THIS IS THE ONLY FLAT IRON and serum I will be using. My hair stylist was so shocked by the results-completed by myself in approx. 30 min that she went and bought this flat iron to use on her clients!Highly recommend.",5
"This item arrived exactly as expected and in a very reasonable time frame. I have already used the product a few times and it works wonderfully!! I used to have a chi before this one, and I actually think this straightener works better and is not as damaging to my hair, since I can control the heat setting.",5
Wow! The HSi ceramic flatiron is the best flat iron I ever purchased. It doesn't burn my hair out. When I am flat ironing my hair it doesn't let off smoke. It glides along my hair smoothly and leaves my hair looking good. It heats up and cools down quickly. It only takes one time over your hair to straighten it. My hair is flowing and light. It's healthy. Also make sure to get the HSi Argan oil that gives hair an extra shine.,5
"I bought this for a trip to Europe this summer and this flat iron worked perfectly in Italy and Greece - all that was necessary was a simple adaptor. There is no switch to change the voltage; the flat iron converts the voltage automatically, which kind of confused me at first, as the product instructions are very vague. My teenage daughter loved it as well - just plug it in and go! Highly recommend.UPDATE***For no reason, the iron just stopped heating up - wasn't dropped, or damaged in any way (that I know of). Shouldn't have this kind of failure for an iron that's 9 months old. I contacted the company, HSI, through their website, and got an email back promptly with troubleshooting tips. When those didn't work, the rep said to ship it back, and they'd send me a new one. I had to pay about $5 for priority mail shipping, but wanted to make sure it got there. HSI shipped a new flat iron out to me about a week or so later, which is awesome, because I'm headed to Paris next week!!!A good product, and a good company that stands behind its product!! Still highly highly recommended!!",5
I am soooooo satisfied with my purchase of this flat iron.  We are ususally TEAM FHI. I have purchased two FHI's from amazon and needed a 3rd one to send off to college with my daughter. I did not want to spend a 100 bucks for another flat iron so I searched for a comparable one until I came across these HSI Stylers. I read all the great reviews and decided to purchase them. I love them!!! My HSI works just as good or even better than the FHI but half the price. It leaves your hair straight and silky smooth!! I am now Team HSI!!,5
Love this flat iron. My hair is very fine and color treated. Most flat irons fry the ends and it lookslike straw. Not with this! My hair is smooth straight and shiny. Highly recommend this flat iron!,5
"This straightener is THE BEST you can ever find.  I was also unaware of this brand since you always here about Chi.  I am so glad I purchased this thing-it works better than any straightener that I have used myself or at the salon.  I have very thick, wavy hair and I have never been able to get a nice straight style that looks as good as it does after a salon visit.  My hair has never looked better after using this the first time and it stayed exactly the same for two days after so I didnt have to go back and touch up every morning like I normally have to with other products.  I paid $20 more for a lower brand straightener at Target but it never seems to get my hair as straight as anything used in a salon.  It also didnt take me an hour to go through all of my hair-I was done in 30 minutes.  It does go up to 400 degrees so it gets a little hot but they include a very nice heat glove for your protection (which works really well). Another bonus was the nice storage/travel case as well as the sample Aragon oil bottle.  I normally do not like to use any heat appliance for my hair too often since it can cause a lot of long term damage but my hair looks so good after using this I cannot help myself.  For anyone that has ever wished for your curls to be straight (at least for one full day) this is the best thing to buy!",5
"I am newer to this straightener world, but with my new hair cut, I need a good one! After throwing out my cheap, crappy straightener, I went on Amazon in search of a good straightener with a reasonable price.  My friends have told me of their horror stories of spending hundreds of dollars on those expensive straighteners to only have them break a few months later.  After searching for the highest rating and lowest price, I stumble on the HSI professional straightener and was surprised by the great reviews.  Could it be that there is a good straightener with a reasonable price?Well, it is! When I got this straightener I was immediately impressed with the packaging which included extra goodies like a case, burn glove, and argon oil.  When I tried the straightener out I was shocked of how great it was!  It gets really hot and does the same job as those expensive straighteners for a quarter of the price.  My only criticism is that there is no automatic shutoff.  Despite this, I have told my family and friends about the product and will be back to buy more products from HSI!Update 10/2/13:  I ended up getting rid of this straightener.  It developed a horrible burned build up (from hair products) on it that I have not see with other straighteners and I was unable to get it off.  I replaced it with a new brand and would not buy this one again.",2
"I've purchased a lot of flat iron from CHi ranging anywhere from $80 to $150 a flat iron. I also like Bablybliss. I've been using flat irons for about 10 years, and I have tried most brands on the market. Most flat irons do not do well on my hair when it is a no wash day, but I tried it, and it really worked. I tried it on a wash day and my hair stayed straight and smooth. Usually by the end of the day with humidity my hair starts to frizz, and it stayed pretty good. Plus it is fast. Many flat irons take several times over the hair to straighten my hair, but my hair was completely straight and smooth in one try.  I hope this flat iron lasts. It was a good price and it received high ratings and so far I give it 5 stars. It came in one day, and worked on smoothed and straightened my hair.  I recommend the HSI flat iron.",5
"Great straightener. Heats up quick and really works. The straightest my hair has ever been! It is the perfect width -- you aren't doing one hair at a time but its also not clunky. I  love the glove that comes with it, no more scorching your finger tips and it comes with a nice sleeve to put it in after you are done. Also good for putting under while it hot, so no fears of scorching your counter top.",5
"I can't believe how well this works. It is true as other reviewers have said that the buttons are a little hard to get to, but they are on almost all straighteners. The shaft is a little shorter than I would have liked when I first pulled it out of the box and saw everything. You get a nice velvet bag to put it in and some gloves and oil for your hair. The oil is really nice. I put way too much on my hand and rubbed it into the ends my hair before bed and thought I would turn into a greasy mess by morning but I didn't. Then I turned it on and started straightning my already straight hair and was impressed. Then my daughter came in who had gone to bed with a wet head and has natural curly-wavy hair that is hard to straighten with a blow dryer. We are not talking kinky curly but enough curl in the back to cause us frustration every time we straighten. I couldn't believe this little straightener worked! She had totally straight hair and it didn't take forever! I am very happy with my purchase and am floored this was only 40 dollars. Ya something that actually works and that I can afford.",5
This is a great product. I highly recomend it. It curls and straightens well and heats up well to straighten even thick hair. I like this better than my last straightner that I paid nearly 100$ for. This one I got for only 37.99!,5
"I've used several different brands on my thick hair, and the HSI was by far the best one. I normally have to go over a section more than once, even with a high heat setting, and I hate the damage it does to my hair. The HSI made my hair perfectly smooth in just one pass, and it stayed straight and shiny. It was such a great price for a professional straightener like this.It was shipped out quickly and arrived on time. Love it and would recommend it over any other brand!",5
"I wasn't really sure what to expect but I thought I would take a chance on this straightener and I love it.  It makes my hair smooth, and doesn't pull or catch on my hair.  It is a wonderful product.  It also came with a sample of Argan oil which is a wonderful product as well.  Overall, this is the best straightener I have ever owned.  I will now buy nothing else.",5
"My new favorite toy. The HSI flat iron came packaged with a few sweet surprises. The seller packed in a sample of HSI Argan Oil, as well as bonus HSI Heat Resistant Glove that retails on its own on Amazon for $10. I had actually planned on purchasing this later. So I was pleasantly surprised to see it in my box. The flat iron itself comes with a heat resistant pouch for storage. The iron is amazing. AMAZING.  I have had both a Chi and a GHD and this far exceeded the quality of both. This boasts floating plates that have yet to snag my hair, and again, to my content, a longer swiveling 7 foot cord. The 1"" plates heat up from 140F to 410F and can be used to straighten, flip and curl your hair. The plates contain both ceramic and tourmaline making this a major selling point for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair. {Tourmaline in the plates increases negative ions which balance hair to drastically reduce static and frizz while ceramic disperses heat evenly for fast, safe styling sealing cuticles to lock in moisture and leave hair smooth and shiny.} It offers flash heating,  and once hot, the iron stays evenly heated until you turn it off. For me, this is a single pass iron, I had no need to go back and smooth over with a second pass. All the reviews on Amazon were right, this a superior product to any of the brand irons on the market. I highly suggest this iron, definitely get it while it's on the big sale if you can! I don't know how long it will be before it's back at the $300 price point. Even if you buy it then, it's worth every penny!To recap, you get a professional ceramic and tourmaline infused iron with swiveling 7 foot cord with floating plates that heat up from 140 to 410 degrees Farenheit for $40. For the time being. Remember this is a $300 iron.Overall, I am intensely happy with my purchase, and put my name behind them as outstanding quality products!For more information, check out my beauty blog at southerngorgeous.blogspot.com!",5
I have been using CHI for years and thought it was time for a change. My hairdresser actually told me about this iron. I love it!!!!,5
"A teenage girl getting ready for highschool is an ordeal!  One of the biggest worries is ""bad hair"" days.  My granddaughter is always looking for the perfect solution to her hair problems...long hair but without a lot of body.  She found this hair straightener on Amazaon and we decided we'd give it a try.  What a perfect choice!  She loves the feel of the product and was so glad to find the glove in the box.  She's always burning her fingertips so it was a real plus.  It straightens her hair as no other product has but still leaves it so shiny and silky.  Usually after straightening her hair looks a bit frizzed and dry, but not with this one.  She loves her machine and babies it.  So, we've taken away some pre school jitters for a freshman.....the worries of ""bad hair"" days are gone!  Thanks Amazon.  A-Z we always find the good products.",5
"This one ranks up there with the chi straighteners which I used to own. after I dropped and broke my chi (twice) , I decided to try this product which seemed to have great reviews. It works great! I have really thick coarse hair and the high setting works fabulous without burning the ends. I'm so happy with this product that I'm recommending it to my sister and cousins who live by Chi",5
"I love this flat iron!! I have naturally curly/wavy hair and have the option of flat ironing. This flat iron works very well, gets as hot as you need it and glides through my hair. Just remember to work in small sections and you will get the result you are looking for. The argan oil is a nice bonus. It smells good and makes your hair nice and smooth. And, for the price, I think it is a great dea!",5
I've always wanted this hair straightener because my friend had it and she would straighten my hair and it would turn out great! Then i finally got my own and wowza it works like a charm!,5
I have really curly hair so it is hard to get my hair straight and silky. I previously owned the onepass by bio ionic and that worked ok but the strips got worn. I was going to buy the onepass again but I didn't want to spend over $100 to have to replace it in a year. After searching amazon I found the HSI flat iron which I still don't understand how it went from $299 to $42.63 (the price I got it for) but the reviews were great and that is my kind of price so I decided to try the HSI. Before I flat iron my hair I washed it then put the free sample of HSI argan oil with coconut oil. My hair transformed from curly and frizzy to soft and manageable.... so far so good.,5
"I had to get a new hair straightener after my old roommate used mine while I was on vacation and left loads of seared on hairspray on it that I couldn't clean off. My old straightener can't hold a candle to this one!This one has a much higher temperature range starting at 140 all the way up to 410F. My old one could only do 50-350F degrees. Not sure I'll need to go as high as 410F but what the heck its nice to have.I was worried this straightener wouldn't do the job since it was a brand Ive never heard of nor did I get to test it out before the buy. My old straightener I bought after having a similar one used on my hair at a salon. But I can definitely tell you this thing is a beast! And for half the cost or less of a CHI or some of the other high priced brands.My only con, is that so far I don't see any indicator lights to let you know it is on or has reached the desired heat limit. Not sure if I'm just blind and didn't see it. Also it doesn't have an auto shut off feature, so BE CAREFUL!This little beast can give CHI a run for their money if you buy it from Amazon. I got it for about $40 at the time of this post. Well worth every penny and then some!",5
"I got the product the same day. THANK YOU AMAZON! The flat iron works well, you can adjust the tempature- I like mine on the hotter side as I have coarse curly hair. I have used it 3 times now, and it works great! The package came with Argon Oil- which I will buy a bigger botter of as I like the shine it gave my hair. The flat iron also came with a bag of its on and a glove. Very cool product you won't be disappointed.",5
"I am in love with the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch!!!  It heats up quickly and gets my hair straighter than any other flat iron that I have ever used.  I am absolutely thrilled that I bought this product!",5
Great! Work really well heated up super fast. All you need :)X x x x x x x x x x x x x x x,5
"I've only had this flat iron two weeks and its been working great.  I used to have an expensive Sedu flat iron that went on the fritz just as the warranty went out. I didn't want to spend over a hundred dollars on another flat iron.  After seeing the reviews, I decided to buy this one for half that price and give it a try.  I'll write back if I have any issues, but for the price it performs like any brand that would cost twice the price.  I have shoulder length, thick hair and this iron does a great job.",5
"I've recently ordered this HSI flat iron a couple days ago and i'm already loving it. Because i'm cheap, (haha..) I used the SUPER savings option which made the shipping go from 3-5 days to 5-8 days. I expected it to arrive pretty late but the seller was quick in shipping & delivery. It came much earlier than the estimated arrival date which was a big plus. This HSI iron comes with everything mentioned + a glove with no extra charge. The pouch is really nice and soft. I have yet to use the argon oil, but judging from the other comments, it seems to be pretty effective. I also love the heat up. It's extremely fast. At first, I wondered how I would be able to tell when it would be ready because the indicator slightly blends in with the rest of the iron. After examining it, I found out it's there. Ohh right, the cost. For only $40, this flat iron is extremely affordable. The cost does not match the function of this product. Overall, this is a fantastic deal & I have recommended it to many friends already.",5
"This is the BEST most inexpensive flat iron I have EVER owened. I have had the cheapest to the most expensive & this is the VERY BEST of them all. I got it super quick and it works great. I just used it for the first time on my VERY coarse natural hair and I am SUPER impressed. I didn't have it on high and it straightened my hair on the first pull through. I'm about to purchase another one in case it goes up from all the great reviews, and just to have another one whenever this one goes out! I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!! I also used it with the steam iron that cost 3 times as much and couldn't do half of what this iron did!!!!!!! ITS SIMPLY THE BEST, especially for the price. Way better than my peace of crap, chi, fhi & gold n hot!",5
Excellent hair straightener.  One of the best ones I've ever used.  Even better than the Chi.  I would recommend this straightener to anyone.  Plus I received a pretty storage bag for it free.  On a scale of 1-10 its a 12.,5
I absolutely love this straightener! After struggling with my Remington straightner on my thick wavy hair for a few years I decided to try a new one. There is a significant difference between the performance of my HSI straightner and my old one- the HSI straightens quickly and makes my hair really shiny! I would definatly recommend this straightner even at two times the price!,5
I love how this straightner doesnt leave your hair dry. Its the best. I just bought it and I am very happy with it.,4
"The flat iron works quite well.  I had a little problem at first, but realized I just needed to turn it up a little higher.  It heats up quickly and makes my hair feel silky and smooth.",5
"I've been using this straightener for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it! Not only does it heat quickly at 410 degrees, but it leaves my hair looking shiny and feeling soft. I also use it to curl my hair because it curls my hair better than my actual curling iron. It arrived in record time and came with a red pouch for storage,a glove, and argon oil. If you have any hesitations about purchasing this product, forget about your worries! You won't regret it. 5 Stars this product is EXCELLENT!",5
"I have never needed to use a flat iron since I was born with naturally straight hair (which I never liked as a kid!) but since I have gotten older for some reason I now have ""bends"" as I call them and I have enough of them that I have to use a straightener (Bumble and Bumble Straight....love it!).  I always had to pay for ""bends"" or even curls but now I have what I always wanted as a kid.  My stylist has been using a flat iron on my hair and I love the way it looks!! So I bought this one after researching several irons and reading the reviews.  This one iron seemed to have the best reviews and the price was right!!  I have been using this for a week or so and I love it!  It gets nice and hot (I use a protectant on my hair....Aveda Brilliant Damage Control) and it straightens beautifully.  I have long hair and the plates are thin..1 inch... but do the job effortlessly. The price was great and the product is totally worth it. If you need a flat iron and not sure of which one.....THIS WORKS!",5
"The wife is super happy with this iron flat or whatever this is... So need I say more?! OK I will anyway... She says this is the best flattening iron or ironing flat she has EVER used--believe me, she has gone through a few! The oil thingy that comes with it is supposed be magical as it helped her tame her otherwise wild hair! So I am ordering an extra bottle of that oil for her--she used a VERY tiny amount of it when she used the flat iron the first time, so the 2 oz. bottle they sell should last you a very long time, unless you straighten your hair once or twice a day... It still should last you over a month I'd say. Anyhow, so overall, a five-star product in my book. Wife is happy, which means I am happy too! :)",5
"I bought the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener to use on holiday in the USA. I have very thick hair and wanted to look sleek and groomed on holiday. The straighteners were great. They have variable temperature - very suitable to use in the States where the voltage is different to the UK. They were one inch very good for my mid length thick hair.I had them delivered to my son's address in States. Delivery was very speedy and efficient.Also glove,case and Argan oil were part of the deal.",4
"I recently purchased the CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER.  I am a stylist and must say I was skeptical at first because I was not familiar with the brand.  After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance on this product.  I ordered the flat iron along with the stand.  Both arrived as promised nicely packaged.  I opened it up and couldn't wait to see if the iron would live up to the hype.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised immediately, the flat iron get hot right away and gets the job done.  I was so pleased that I ordered an additional CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER for my 16 year old daughter this morning.  I have used many professional flat irons including CHI, Paul Mitchel and Hot Tools just to name a few, this flat iron, hands down, is the best.",5
I love this straighter. Heats up fast and works on wet hair. Thin and easy to use. Goes through hair smoothly. I have medium length hair and I finish straightening my hair within 15 minutes.,5
My wife love it...She think its better than CHI that she have for 2 years..She likes it coz theres heat adjustment..Highly recommend this product..,5
"HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment I researched for a while and decided on this product because of all the wonderful reviews. Now I know why there were so many. This is a great hair straightener, I have never been very handy when it comes to fixing my hair, but I wanted the same results as my hair dresser & I got that THE FIRST Time I used this tool. I like it so much I bought two - one for my suitcase as I travel a lot on business. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this flat iron to anyone.",5
"I initially was going to invest in a Chi flat iron, but heard and saw so many complaints from friends and on the product themselves that they go out or break easily and the customer service is horrible. With that brand being sooo very expensive I decided to go somewhere else even though I always get hit with the ""you get what you pay for"" thing. So I decided to search on here to find one cause Amazon has never failed me. I found this seller and this brand, the HSI 1"" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. I'm not big on name brands cause I just flat out don't know anything about hair products (and electronics lol) and it was my very first hair straightener and didn't really know what I was looking for and everyone I told about this one (friend wise) said don't get it cause it's generic and probably cheap/will break/won't work. It turns out this is the straightener that my actual stylist uses and has been using. She's never had a problem with it and loves it. AND she's had it for a long time and uses it everyday for her business and she's really popular and busy and it has yet to fail her. Well, I got it in record time, cause these sellers are amazing. I immediately started experimenting with it on myself to learn how to use it on my own hair. Well, let me tell you. My hair is notorious for NOT holding any curls or even after styled with the Chi or any straightener. I put this one on several settings and used it over a span of two weeks to see what worked for me. Turns out that I need really, really high heat and this iron had the settings for it. I have never been more happy with my hair!! This iron works very well for me. Anyone who says anything about the controls being inside instead of the outside complains. But I love it. I am a total klutz and will forget to set it to the correct settings or bump it and change the settings or flat off turn it off (this is my experience with curling irons), but with this one, since it's inside I was able to be set and permanently set for my special needs. Like I said others I'd bump and it would change the setting to low (from my friends irons). I'm still on those settings and it's is really portable and STILL doesn't change my settings! My stylist actually told me the reason why people haven't heard of this brand is because it is used specifically with professionals! I was blown away that she actually approved of something I bought FINALLY!! LOL But I have had it for months now and the oil they include in it is amazing (I recommend in investing in a whole bottle of the oil, it's that great!) The oil and the straightener makes my hair so shiny, health looking, full bodied, flippy and moveable without falling, even in Texas humidity. I barely use hairspray cause of this straightener is just that strong. I LOVE IT! I highly recommend it and I think the only way it's going to fail is because of age (which will be a long time) or if you drop it or do something to make it not work. Yes, it turns off automatically, but it's a nice safety feature, especially for someone like me. I have nothing but great things to say about this about this straightener and could go on and on how amazing it is, but you really have to experience it out to for yourself to understand my enthusiasm about it. I bought one for my cousin, who has a Chi, and she's since given away her Chi and even bought a back up one just in case she loses her HSI...cause she's goofy like me! If anything ever happens to mine, I won't hesitate to buy another one. And the price is oh so great! <3",5
"I purchased the HSI flat iron after my Chi had suddenly stopped working after just 4 months of use. I read product reviews and decided to take a chance on HSI (I have not heard of the brand before). Since using the HSI flat iron for the past month, I have no complaints, it works great! My hair is wavy and the HSI is able to keep the curl in my hair if I choose to do so (or make is super straight on other days), due to the design of the flat iron, it is versatile. I am happy with the HSI and would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5
"I'm not a girl that has to be all perfect looking, and I have curly hair that is a little chaotic. I DO like to pick my moments when I want to look polished though.I have a curling iron, a rotating curling iron/brush thingy, and a ""wet to dry"" flat iron (that's not really flat). I have recently been trying to get my hair straight, but it's a no go. All my heat tools were crap. I'm seriously going to take them to goodwill now that I have this great little flat iron.It heats evenly, it makes my hair perfectly straight, and my hair does not get pulled on- this tool glides so smoothly. I finally have something that feels as good as my hairdresser's flat iron. Love this, and I hope it lasts forever. Worth every penny.I haven't tried the oil that comes with it yet, though it smells nice- I didn't want to have my first impression of this thing skewed by some new product. I used the same leave in conditioner I always do, and I got amazingly straight, shiny, healthy looking hair.",5
"This Flat Iron is the best one I have ever had.  I have wavy/curly hair which frizzes easily.  This iron worked so well, it took me half the time and it was a joy to use.  My hair looked almost as good as when my hairdresser does it and it lasted!  I am so happy with this product.  This iron makes my last one seem like a toy.  I don't know why I waited so long to replace it but I thought it was just me.  If you think you want a new Flat Iron...do not hesitate to purchase this one.",5
I am going to start out by saying I am glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews posted on here. I received the HSI straightener before the date estimated and instantly used it. I straightened my hair first because my hair was wavy and my hair came out nice and straight with a great shine to it. I curled it later that day for class and the curls were BEAUTIFUL! I prefer the curls that look messy and tussled which is the kind of curls this straightener gives. I loved this product very much and it makes me regret buying the 'HerStyler' ones you get in the mall for 150+ It also came with a nice burgundy sleeve to keep it in when you travel. I also like that there is a heat setting because my last one didn't have one and was always so hot and fried my hair. With this straightener I can control the heat to my hair type. I would definitely recommend this straightener to anybody looking for a durable straightener that can straighten and curl!,5
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this hair straightener..I was really upset when my prior Corioliss Straightener burned out on me..I researched and thought and thought about what to get next..I have also had a CHI as well and was not highly impressed especially for the price!  So after reading lots of reviews between Amazon and google and looking for the ""best hair straighteners of 2012"" I finally decided the reviews on this one were very high with lots of happy people..I figured if I didnt think so I could exchange it for something else...with the GREAT price though I had to check it out...MAN AM I HAPPY I DID!!  I think this is literally the best one I have had yet..I have tried every single cheap and expensive one too..I have finer frizzy curly hair that just hates the humidity and let me tell you this thing is GREAT!!  It straightens with ease without pulling, burning or drying out my hair...I dont have to go over the same spot more than once (maybe twice if unruly) and it is constructed well I feel it will last a long time..I promise you, I was not sure of it and am glad I decided to try it out..you will be highly impressed with the product AND the great price!!!!",5
This is an incredible iron for the price.  I bought this based on the reviews and price and was not disappointed.  The most expensive iron I owned was a CHI and it continually pulled and broke my fine hair.  This flat iron is so easy to use with great results.,5
"My college daughter wanted a ceramic 1"" Flat Iron that was 450 degrees. After doing research online I chose the 1"" Tourmaline Flat Iron due to its adjustable heat features and slimline look. After she tried it out the first time, she called me and excitedly explained that her hair had never looked smoother and straighter and she was extremely happy! It made her day!  Thanks Mom!",5
"This is by far the best flat iron I've purchased. I ordered and it was delivered in a properly packaged box in way less time than i was told. Ran to my house like a little school girl and began opening the package. plugged it in and started using it. right away i noticed how much faster and smoother my hair was compared to the other flat iron. The reviews on this product were great that's what caught my eye. I have thin long unmanageable hair. doesn't keep a curl and wouldn't stay straight. Wavy frizzy hair. Scary really. I work with professional people from upper class backgrounds and they always look perfect. i used this one time it was fast and stayed that way. My hair was softer, shinier healthy looking and very pretty. Worth way more than I paid for it. I have been asking around what people would recommend and it was always a 200.00 flat iron. I heard all the horror stories about how chi breaks after a year and women getting ripped off at the mall for junk irons at kiosks, i didn't want to go that route and I'm glad i didn't I'm very happy with my new flat iron and who i purchased from.",5
"This hair straightener literally saves my girlfriend 25-45 minutes every morning. She's been praising me on my purchase, so I must praise the sellers on their product. Thank you, a million times, thank you.Instead of having to go over the same spot 10+ times, she can straighten or curl ONCE, and be finished with that area. Amazing results. Please buy this for your girlfriend!**UPDATE**(11/29/12)Our dogs knocked it over and broke a piece off of the iron. Still worked, but obviously repurchased again for saftey.GIRLFRIEND STILL THANKS ME after all this time. Gotta love it.",5
"I needed an new flat iron, but did not realize until I received this just how badly I needed one!!  There is such a difference in my hair since using this.  My hair style stays all day.  I have extremely straight, fine hair. This iron actually controls it!!  I wish I had found it years ago!!",5
"After reading the positive reviews, I was excited to order this and just as happy when it finally arrived today.  I have had trouble finding a straightener that works well for my hair.  Thankfully my search is over! I have most recently used the InStyler and the Remington straightener.  I was not happy with the Remington straightener and have not been happy with it (I wrote a separate review for it).  My hair is frizzy and slightly curly when dried and can be unnecessarily difficult to straighten.I had already used my other straightener when the HSI straightener arrived.  I used the Argon Oil that was included and loved it!  The HSI straightener did an amazing job!  I am so happy I purchased this and wish I would have purchased it sooner.  It is a better quality product for the same price as the Remington hair straightener.What makes this product wonderful besides the fact that it does an amazing job straightening my hair:1.  The hair straightener itself is black and sleek.2.  The straightener has a soft, rubber casing which feels great and much better than the plastic of other straighteners.3.  The on/off switch is inside the inner part of the straightener, not on the outside where you can accidentally hit the on/off button while straightening your hair like with other straighteners.4. This is not digital, the temperature control is inside the inner part of the straightener next to the on/off switch and is a turn knob.5. There is a Red/Green light on the outside of the straightener to let you know when the straightener is at the correct temperature.  Red for heating to or back to the temperature or green indicates it is at the correct set temperature.  The light will change if the temperature drops so it can maintain the even temperature.6.  This comes with a very nice sleek red pouch to keep your straightener in.7.  The straightener came with a small bottle of Argon Oil to be used. I haven't used Argon Oil before (but I have used several other products).  I love the Argon Oil and it compliments the HSI straightener very well.  I will only purchase the Argon Oil going forward.I would definitely recommend this straightener over any other straightener.  I have used several straighteners in the past, including the InStyler and the HSI Straightener puts all of those to shame.  This left my hair soft, sleek and straight!!  For the price, quality of the product and outcomes this is the only straightener you will need.My review isn't paid and I purchased this myself.  I believe in leaving honest reviews as I have with my past reviews of products I have purchased.I hope this is helpful and makes your decision a lot easier!  I wish I would have known about the HSI Straightener a long time ago!",5
"I must say that I had doubts about this flat iron although I seen so many good responses, I just never seem to get good results with irons.I just received my package today and I am definitely impressed with my purchase well worth the money! I'm an African american woman and this gets my hair super straight and shiny! I think I'm in love :)",5
"Iron heats up quickly, feels good to hold, forms a nice grip on my hair, and straightens effectively.  I'm happy with the product",5
"The HSI flat iron is amazing...straight hair without the fuzzy burn. My previous flat iron - professional chi - was just too hot for treated hair. The HSI is hot enough to straighten, yet leaves my long hair undamaged and looking quite smooth. HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment",5
I was looking for a flat iron as my daughter and I both have very thick hair. Most flat irons just don't seem to straighten our hair. I say that the HSI flat iron worked great. It straightens after one pass and hasn't damaged my hair. I would certainly order this again.,5
"I highly recommend this product! My husband is a hairStylist and he has worked with a variety of flat irons, this one being the best so far. I've had my hair flat ironedMany times before and I have never been so pleased with the results like I am nowUsing this brand. It's great, it leaves my hair shiny, soft, and healthy believe itOr not. I Highly recommend it to anyone whoLikes keeping their hair straight while having itHealthy when left with its natural wave .",5
It gets very hot and works as well as the one that I paid twice as much for that I had to replace after 5 years. I also liked the free gifts that came with this one. great price and good seller too!,5
"I just used this flat iron yesterday for the first time and cannot believe how well it works. I have curly hair and not all flat irons work well for me, but this one is amazing! I let my curly hair air dry and then later in the day brushed through it, so it was very frizzy. Mind you, this was hours after I intended to use the flat iron. So the frizz was even worse. but this made my hair smooth and silky. The difference from one side to the other was incredible. Even my daughter who was helping me do my hair couldn't believe how well it worked. So much so that she even wants one for herself! I highly recommend this flat iron!",5
"I bought this straightener after my old one finally crapped out on me.  I read so many reviews about this one and SO many others (I think I spent days reading reviews, lol!).  I was very nervous purchasing a product like this on-line, as I had never heard of this brand especially.  I have had mine now for about 3 months, straightening about twice a week and I absolutely love it!!!  It has cut down on time, used to take me about an hour to straighten, now about 35-40 mins.  It does not pull your hair and clamps down really tight.I have fine but thick curly/wavy hair, a few inches below my shoulders.  Before using my straightener I use a couple smoothing prep products in my hair (which you should always do when using heat or a hair straightener).  I blow dry using a big round barrel brush, after I run my HSI through my hair, only having to go over each piece once or twice.  It gets perfectly smooth just like you would get in a salon.  My hair stays perfectly straight for days afterwards and it's so silky smooth!  Has even stood up to humidity!  The straightener gets very hot so be careful to not burn your hands (or hair).  I would highly suggest this product to anyone, you will not regret it!  :)P.S. I did get the bottle of the Argain Oil with mine.",5
"love this thing! it heats up quickly and that is a plus..you know when you walk back in and notice there is a spot that needs retouched real quick?i do seem to think my hair does look really superhealthy..shine is always my goal! i also have noticed with this flat iron...my hair seems to ""last"" longer without going limp?? i do love straight hair but mine is thin..so as i straighten i pull up....so its not flat. i now have supershiny bouncy healthy looking hair..and i am down to washing every third day!!! man, i have so much more ""me"" time in the morning...not fussin with my hair!!",5
"I'm of Caribbean descent with very thick/relaxed hair. The previous flat irons that I've used caused a lot of hair breakage. After researching flat irons online, I decided to purchase the HSI 1"" Ceramic Flat Iron. I have no regrets, and for the quality and price, it was an excellent choice.The surface of the flat iron surface has a smooth finish that does not pull or break the hair. It locks in the moisture in your hair and you can control the heat based on your hair texture.I love the sleeve this flat iron came in, which would be excellent to use when travelling.This also came with a sample Argan Oil, which is similar to the Moroccan Oil; very light weight but adds shine and moisture. I must add that it makes your hair smell soo nice!Excellent investment for your hair. I recommend it!",5
"This is a great hair straightener, and you can't beat the price. I had one that I loved that cost almost twice as much as this one, and it stopped working. I didn't want to spend too much on a replacement, but I wanted a really good product. Due to the great price of this one, I decided to give it a try, and I love it! My hair is not extremely thick or curly, so it's not too terribly difficult to straighten it, but it does get frizzy and damaged easily. This straightener is wonderful. My hair is soft and shiny after using it. I don't use it at full heat- I have the dial turned about halfway, and it works perfectly. I have also tried using this to curl my hair, and with some practice, I was able to get natural-looking waves and curls - better than my curling wand.",5
"After finally deciding to buy my first flat iron, I went to Amazon and found this one which had more than 500 reviews. 400 of them were either 4 or 5 stars so I took the plunge and ordered it. It came very well packed with a heat resistant glove and a small bottle of the Argan oil. The flat iron worked extremely well, the plates were smooth, heating up and straightening my thick hair without burning or singeing it in any way. It seems comparable with some of the more expensive irons in quality. I haven't used the glove yet but I did use the Argan oil and it made my hair extremely soft, non-greasy, bouncy, and shiny. I'm not sure if it was the iron or the oil, but both products were wonderful. They also arrived on time so if you are debating on ordering it, I would highly recommend that you do.",5
I just got this straightener last week... I already have a Revlon straightener so my main focus for this one was the curling part.  This straightener works amazing for curling your hair! I have long thick hair that used to take me 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours to curl it with a curling iron... now with this straightener it takes about a 1/2 an hour! I like the carrying pouch it came with as well.  It seems to heat up pretty quick too.  All in All I would suggest buying this straightener!UPDATE:I have been using this straightener for probably almost a year now and it has stopped working. I absolutely love the straightener while it lasted and seemed to not be as bad on my hair as cheap ones.,5
"This straightener was for my daughter.  She previously owned a Chi straightener, which also is a quality product.  My daughter really likes this new straightener and it even came with a glove and some special hair treatment oil.  The product was also shipped very quickly!  Very happy with this seller and the exceptional value of this product.",5
I purchased this Iron after my CHI power chord broke and was afraid to buy another chi even though they are great they are made with very poor quality. This iron heats up faster than the chi works better and it very strong and durable.  I cant begin to explain to you how good of  iron this is. THe oil they send you along with it is amazing as well. When this one breaks if it ever breaks we will purchase another of the same model.,5
Fabulous. My wife says it works great. It is just as good as she uses at the salon when she has her hair done.,5
"Good design, heats up fast, quality product. Love the Argan oil sample. Classy touch to add the storage bag and heat protection glove. Very fast shipping.",4
"Well I was wondering in purchasing a straighter for my wife and I reviewed many because I didn't want to make a mistake, I came upon the HSI ceramic hair straighter in amazon. I read the reviews and only saw good ones, there were a couple a bad ones, but decided to get it.  When I got the product it feels expensive heavy and has a tough durable look to it. My wife loved it. If you guys wanna score high points with the GF or wifey this is a good one at least to get home at 3am excuse no questions asked. Well maybe after the usual let me smell if you have girl perfume. BUT great product.",5
I purchased for my daughter with very long thick hair. She is very pleased with the quality of the product.,5
"I purchased HSI 1"" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for my mother as a Christmas present. She is prone to stealing the flat iron that I own and I was getting annoyed. Ironically shortly after Christmas my flat iron broke and I am now borrowing hers. The HSI is a great flat iron, it heats up really quickly. I have really curly hair and it was able to give me a soft smooth straight that is not flat. It also created a nice shine to my hair. As for my mother she has very coarse dry hair. With the HSI she is also able to achieve a very smooth look. The best part about this flat iron is the price; I can not believe how well the quality is. I used to work in a salon as an assistant and I can say that this is definitely salon quality. After using this product I am looking into purchasing another one for myself.",5
"Got my item fast and it was exactly as described. I would hightly remmend this seller; ships fast, has great products, and great prices!",5
"I bought this hair straightener as a gift for my wife.  She loves it!  It's fast-heating, very easy to use, and it works great.  This seems to be pretty high quality.  A great value for the price.",5
"I bought the hair sraightener for daughter-in-lalaw...she is very happy with it it works as promised in the product description. If she is happy, I am happy.",5
I bought this after my hair stylist recommended a CHI flat iron that I loved when she used it on my hair. I got this one instead because it was less expensive than the CHI irons and it had very good reviews. I received it very quickly and it is a fantastic flat iron that makes my hair look shinier than my old flat iron did.,5
I bought this flat iron for my Granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. It's easy to use and heats up quickly. She likes the little red case for storage when she travels.,5
Awesome product.Just what my wife had been looking for. Her hair is frizz free looks shinner and healthier.Would recommend this product to every lady out there.,5
I found this company one day while surfing the internet. I was looking for a flat iron that worked for my super curly hair that was affordable. I never expected it to work as well as it does. This iron leaves my hair silky and smooth for days and the argan oil works like a charm. I HIGHLY recommend this product.,5
"the ceramic iron works wonders on my natural curly hair, it leaves it much softer then my old iron i used, and the oil helps to keep my hair in tip top shape. thank you",5
"This straightener is great. It warms to more than 400 degrees, and it straightens better than my chi I had previously. I can curl my hair with one attempt and I get ringlet curls that hold with no need for hairspray. I love it.",5
"I have thin asian hair. I use it to straighten my hair on a low setting. And, I've curled my hair with it on a medium setting. The curls lasted for a day and a half without any additional hair products added. It's a really good flat iron. I've recommended it to many of my friends and they all love it. Got it for a great price after black friday sale.",5
"I am a licensed cosmetologist and needed a new iron for work so I started scouring sites looking for the best product at the best price. I hadn't ever heard of this brand before, but the reviews were pretty good, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I was a little confused about the light on the iron. It goes from red to green, and I figured when it turns green, that means the iron is heated to temp; except after it turns green it goes back to red even if I haven't used it. I couldn't find any info on the light in the manual. However, the iron seems to stay hot, whether red or green, so I quit worrying about it. It's also a little too thick for my preference, and heavier than what I used before. But as far as straightening ability, it's fantastic! It glides smoothly and doesn't drag or pull the hair, and leaves hair silky smooth with one pass. So far it's been a great iron and well worth the $40 I paid.",4
"I bought this to replace my old flat iron and I really love this one. It does not heat up as fast as my old one but that's not really a big deal since I always turn it on before I start to dry my hair with the hair dryer and by the time I finish is just right. The Argain Oil is AMAZING, I've been needing a haircut because I had some split-ends and my hair just needed a trim. I haven't had time to go get it cut but the first day I used the flat iron and Argain Oil several people (including my husband) kept telling me how healthy my hair seemed now that I got my hair cut, I loved telling them I had not cut my hair and it was just my new flat iron and AWESOME oil treatment. It makes my hair so smooth, is amazing. I would absolutely recommend it!",5
"I purchased this straightener approx. 1 year ago. I had an issue where it stopped working a few days ago. Blue Novalties did everything to make it right! I was pleasantly surprised with their outstanding customer service. It worked really well on my very natually curly hair. I'd have to agree with the reviews that say sometimes it does get strands of hair caught in the plates because they do move a bit but I didn't find that a big issue for me. I would say a great buy for your money compared to other professional straighteners I've owned. If the one I owned still worked and I wasn't getting a replacement, I'd for sure give it 5 stars. Customer service for Blue Novalties however, for sure 5 star.",4
"HSI 1 tourmaline ionic flat iron was bought to replace my old $150.00 flat iron. Can't believe this one is as good if not better. Amazing, got lucky with this great deal.",5
"LOVE this straightener!I purchased one for my little sister for her birthday, and of course, being her big sister, I had to try it out first just to make sure it worked ok.  :)  I tried it and immediately loved the results, so I ordered one for myself.  I've been using it for about 3 months now and love it just as much now as I did the first day.  It doesn't leave lines in my hair like my old one did and my hair looks healthy and shiny.",5
"I love love love this product.  Usually it takes forever to straighten my thick, long hair; but this works so quickly.  The ability to set different temperature levels is very nice, however I have only used it on full.  It heats up quickly and leaves my hair silky.  I recommend buying the holder for it because it really is a nice addition and makes the process and the storage much easier.  I actually prefer this over my old Chi. Highly recommended",5
"I'm in the process of growing my almost-all-my-adult-life short hair out into a bob.  I have coarse hair, so when I style it with a blow dryer, I'm not happy with how it looks. It looks kinky and damaged, almost.  So I would take a curling iron and try to straighten it with that.  Nope, not happy with that, either.  So then I'd end up curling it, and it looked too futzy, too styled, if that makes any sense.This flat iron makes my hair into a sleek and shiny, simple style that doesn't look like I spent hours on it -- which is the look I want but have never before been able to achieve.I like the adjustable temperature.  I like how fast it gets very hot.  The only minor thing I don't like is how sometimes my hair gets caught and pulled out, but that happens with brushes, curling irons, every appliance you use on your hair.I feel like this flat iron is a quality implement worth much more than what I paid for it.  I'd highly recommend it.",5
"I recently received this straightener and was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  I didn't want to spend over a hundred dollars on a straightener as I really only regularly use it on my bangs.  It has very smooth floating ceramic plates that pivot to make it easy to curl and flip hair without creating creases.  I have very long hair and found it to easily accomodate sections.  It has a nice textured grip that makes it easy to stay in control.  It opens and closes without much effort but not so easily that it snaps onto the hair.  It heats up very quickly and the outside remains cool so you can hold the end closed with your hand while turning the iron to create perfect curls.  It also came with a glove to protect your hand if you need it, though I haven't tried it yet.  The temperature dial is a little vague as it only shows the high and low temps but I didn't find this to be much of a problem.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking to create a variety of hairstyles without buying a bunch of expensive styling tools.",5
"The best flat iron I 've had.For the last 3 years, my experience withflat irons wasn't good (Chi, Gold'n Hot).Finally I found the best.The HSI is the best.",5
Was looking to replace a worn out straightener - ran across this and read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  INCREDIBLE!!!  Makes my hair shiny and does NOT fry it! Love the ready light!  and the temp indicator/selector seems to be much more reliable than the old CHI flat iron I had.  HIGHLY recommend this item and whatta deal!!!!,5
This is Mark's Daughter: I really like this hair straightener because it makes my hair really soft and it is very easy to use. I had a CHI and it broke randomly after I had only had it for 2 months. I also couldn't return it. I have had this straightener for 5 weeks and so far it has been simply amazing. I definitely reccomend it!,5
"I am not at all a high maintenance girl - I just got a bob and don't want the edges to fling out on the sides when I wake up in the morning, you know what I mean? This thing does the trick! It heats up fast and gets the job done. No weird noises, no pain, no steam or anything weird like that. I'm completely satisfied.",5
"Although I had never heard of this brand, it seemed like a great price, so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did! The plates are very smooth, and glide over my hair easily. It's also the perfect size to curl or ""flip"" your hair. I'm very happy with this purchase.",5
"I love the high-end straightener I have been using for the past year, but when I saw this one on sale, I figured I could use a back up.  I decided to try it out when I received it and it has now become by full time straightener.  I love that it easily allows me to add a little curl to the ends of my hair without having to break out my curling iron.  The HSI heats up rapidly and is able to quickly straighten my curly hair, leaving it nice and shiny.  I went to a wedding this past weekend and my hair stayed remarkably straight all through the entire day (and night).  Definitely recommend this product!",5
"This is truly a great straighter, it flows very smoothly over your hair with shiny results. I bought this with the HSI PROFESSIONAL HIGH TEMPERATURE HEAT RESISTANT FLAT HAIR IRON STAND / HOLDER fits most 1 inch models.This product does everything it says it will, and comes with a heat glove, a satin case, and a little bottle of HS1 Argan oil. I am very pleased.The only con is that it does not have an auto shut off, but I unplug the unit after use, so not a big issue for me. Recommend it!",5
I just recieved my HSI straightner in the mail yesterday (which only took two days)...I LOVE IT!! It leaves my hair smooth and healthy looking!! I have tried many different straightners but this is by far the best!! And it came in a cute little red velvet bag!! It is a great price too!!,5
"I love the way my hair looks and feels after using my new HSI flat iron, it's shiny & holds the curl for days. I have fine, color treated, long hair.  After using the free sample of Bio Silk sample before using the flat iron, my hair looked healthier than before.  Even better, I can achieve the look I want on a low setting, which keeps my delicate, processed hair from being fried like with my old straightener.",5
"Was looking for a flat iron to replace my Chi and really didn't want to spend the bigger dollars for a Chi.  Bought an inexpensive flat iron to get by, but my daughter was NOT happy with it.  So when I was browing through Amazon, I came across the HSI's great price but thought I better read the reviews first.  The majority of the reviews were exceptional, so I ordered.  Received it within the timeframe.  It works as well or better than the Chi.  I was a little intimidated by the high heat volume, so I started on the low end.  My daughter and I use it for basic straightening; we do not have thick, wavy hair so will probably never use on the very high heat.  I am extremely happy with this product and even happier with the price.  (My Chi lasted 2 years, so hoping this one lasts as long.)",5
"I bought this HSI ceramic flat iron because of all the great reviews.  I am so glad that I did!  My hair is curly and kinky and absolutely impossible to straighten....before I got the HSI flat iron.  A lot of my friends have other flat irons to include Chi products.  This is by far the best.  With my hair I have to first blow dry it with a round brush, I then follow up with the HSI flat iron.  My hair went from frizz city to being sleek, shiny and soft.  I have tried others and they have never accomplished this.  The iron is easy to handle and is not hot to the touch.  The 360 degree cord keeps it from tangling and inevitably breaking like some of my friend's flat irons.  This is a professional flat iron.  It has multiple heat settings and floating ceramic plates that make straightening my hair a breeze without heat damage.  The price for this HSI is more than reasonable, especially compared to the other brands out there that claim to be top of the line.  The impeccable quality of this flat iron at the price of $44.95 offered by Blue Novelties is an absolute steal.  I would definitely recommend this HSI flat iron to anyone with any hair type that wants professionally looking straight hair.",5
"I can't live without this flat iron. It's the best product in the market.I have fine straight hair, but it gets fuzzy when it's hummid. When I use the flat iron in the morning my hair doesn't get fuzzy.I simply think it works and it doesn't damage the hair.:)",5
"As an African American finding a hair product the works is very hard, but this one does.My daughter and I have different grades of hair and this product is flexable enough tohandle the different types.  It is a excellent product and I will be purchasing more ofthem for Christmas.HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free Bio Silk Sample",5
Great flat iron. Able to straighten and curl hair. I really like the ability to control the temperature unlike many chi flat irons. Nice grip on the handle.,5
"OMGGGG, what a bargain. I love this product so much, I barely want to share it with anyone else. LOL. How selfish, right?Let me tell you, my hair is very thick. I am Asian. My hair is naturally straight. I mostly use this product to curl my hair or add waves. In comparison to my regular hair curler (the round barrel)it takes me 15-30 minutes in comparison to the 1-2 hour I used to spend on curling my hair. In addition, once it's curled, it stays that way and doesn't easily fall out. I love love love this product and at that price I feel like buying a back up in case anything should ever happen to the one I have now. Not only am I benefiting from this product, but so are my sisters! I curl their hair and now I'm the go to person when we want to get all dolled up! :)Did I mention, shipping came as fast as promised. Yay!",5
"I ordered this straightener after my old one from a CVS started cracking at the edges and eating my hair.. not okay! So far I am satisfied with the HSI straightener; it gets very hot and straightens easily. The sample of bio silk that comes with this is also great as a finisher!The only drawback is that the coating (a rubbery material) gets very hot sometimes, and it is hard to hold onto both ends when straightening. There is a glove provided, presumably to allow you to hold on to the hot parts, but when I am trying to do my hair quickly it is not something I would take the time to use. It would be nice if there was a small grip at the end that did not warm up, but oh well.",4
"I have bought many flat irons over the past years.  I have wavy hair that is very stuborn and does not stay straight in humidity.  I bought this when my other expensive flat iron gave out on me. It came packaged great, with the bio silk-which I love.  I also like the sily travel pouch it comes with, I don't have to worry about it being damaged when I travel.  It's easy to use-the perfect width and keeps my hair straight all day.  I had never heard of this brand so I was a little nervous, but the straightener exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend to anyone.  Great product.",5
"I read reviews that this flat iron is better (and I got it cheaper) than the chi. I've never owned a chi, but I wouldn't switch after trying this one. It works great. It heats up quickly and does a great job on my hair. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an auto shut off. I don't know if other brands do or not but it would be nice. Overall, I'm pleased with the flat iron and would definitely recommend it.",5
"This flat iron works very well. I am African American and I have very course hair, but this really straightens and softens it. It can get very hot, up to 400 degrees. Most of the time I keep it on 200 to 300 degrees.After washing and blow drying my hair, I use this and it gives me a nice look. I also use it to curl my hair.",5
"I have very thick wavy/frizzy hair that usually takes at least 45 minute to straighten...but this straightener is AMAZING!  One swoop through and my hair is smooth, soft and shiney!!  The straightener gets hot quickly and is super easy to use!  It came with a sample of oil that I haven't tried yet and also comes with a very pretty red satin bag that will come in handy when traveling.  Very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone!",5
"This flat iron does an excellent job of straightening my wavy, fine textured hair.  It stays straight all day.  I like that the heat is adjustable.",5
"I had the Sally Hansen Generic Value Product flat iron previously because it was recommended as a knock-off CHI.  It did a decent job for the price (around $60).  Then it gave out after about two and a half years of straightening goodness.So I shopped Amazon and based on the reviews, bought this.  This is so nice.  From the luxurious red silky bag to the HSI oil sample, you could tell it was all quality.  The iron is much more substantial feeling and heats up very fast.  It does the job well and I believe it could be an over $200 iron.  What a deal!",5
"I like the fact that you can adjust the heat of the iron and that it comes with a really nice pouch. The downside is that it is heavy. I have thick course wavy hair and I am able to get it straight and even with a bit of shine to it, but you need to iron your hair out in small sections. So far I like it but I am not wowed by it.",4
This worked well with my frizz - prone hair . My hair stayed silky after using this flat iron even here in the humid South . So glad I purchased it !,5
"This is my first flat iron. I have long, thick hair that is naturally very frizzy and big. I bought this iron because it had all the features I was looking for - ceramic, ionic, variable temp and it seemed to be a very good deal for the price. It is doing the trick - seems to glide nicely, and it doesn't really take that long to do. Feels smooth and straight - the way I always wanted it!",5
"I have been watching this straightener for awhile, trying to decide If I wanted to spend that much money on one and let me say, I am so glad I did..LOVE it...works great. I have really curly, frizzy hair and this works amazing on it...",5
"I absolutely love this straightener. It is by far the best I've owned and I've had several, and all very nice ones. Thank you for making this great product.",5
"I bought this HSI ceramic flat iron after reading excellent reviews about it.  Luckily the reviews were right on target!  The iron is easy to use, glides smoothly through my hair and has an adjustable heat setting.  It is, hands down, the best straightening iron I have ever used.  I like the fact that it has rounded plates so I can use it to curl the ends of my hair if desired.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  You won't be disappointed!",5
This product straightened my hair well but the knob to set temp. Has no marking or indicator on it and it turns very easily...i never know what temp it is at ...not even a high or low indicator so I wing it when i use it.it heats up quickly .i will most likely keep it to avoid hassle of return but i think something as importantnas the temp button on such an item should have been thought out and implemented.,3
"So A hair straightener on the Gift list I figured pretty easy gift little did I know they range in all areas of prices sizes and even shapes all claiming to be the best. So walking into target Walmart etc... Was a headache because I like to see reviews and feedback before I buy products for myself but since this is for my girlfriend it better last and do its job or ill never hear the end of it. So I trusted the ration of great feedback to the one star reviews that were a little worrisome and I'm glad I did this is mostly what I hear from my girl I obviously am not a personal user if this itemPros : great size . Heats up very quickly cord is a good length , looks stylish , comes with a cute baggy to carry while traveling , comes with a glove but its not used , lightweight and above all it gets the job done with half the time of other products. Also great price ;)Cons : not to many here at all as long as it keeps working as it did brand new for a good amount of time but she did tell me that the sample they send you for your hair wasn't enough to really see if its worth buying whatever that is ladies you might knowOverall great product it works and a great price she Loves it so I love it ill one more thing she doesn't use it every day so I do not know how it will hold up under constant demand",5
"This is my first ""real"" flat iron (I've only had a mini flat iron before) and I have to say that it's a  great product! I've tried a ghd, which IS a hundred times better than this, but also WAY more expensive. For the money, I think this is the best of the best.First, I'll start out with the things I loved about this product. I like that it has a quilted texture, making it easier to grip when styling. The swivel cord is also quite useful. I like that you can easily adjust the temperature. It heats up pretty fast, and has a nice indicator light that tells you when the iron has gotten to your desired temperature. As for the actual styling, it does a good job, but not amazing. I naturally have quite straight, thin-ish hair (it just gets sort of wavy near the ends) so it straightens very easily on me (but only on the highest heat setting; I do use heat protectant). However, when my mom (who has thicker, coarser, and more unruly hair than I do) tried it, it didn't do basically anything to make her hair straighter, and it was on the highest temp. Another thing I don't like are the size and quality of the plates. They don't really seem like real or high-quality ceramic, and are on the shortish side. And speaking of quality, overall it isn't top notch in terms of outward appearance. It looks even worse than a $20 flat iron; it has some small scratches and scuffs and the plastic it's made of doesn't seem like the best quality.I'm usually quite wary about ordering anything that's not directly sold by Amazon, but this seller, Blue Novelties, had great service. The packaging for the flat iron was great, and it comes with a protective sleeve for the iron, a heat-resistant glove, a sample size of HSI's argan oil, and a 20% off coupon for HSI.So overall, if you are looking for a good flat iron that's on the cheaper side, this will be great for you. But I wouldn't recommend this for people with super curly and thick hair.",4
"Let me first start off by saying I have an abundance of curly, semi-thick, long hair. I have not straightened my hair in three years.  During the last three years I have tried to nurture my hair back to health after experiencing severe heat damage.The brand HSI wasn't recognizable at all. Brands like Chi and Sedu are far more popular by name, but I absolutely must say that the HSI was far superior than the Sedu I had. Mind you, the sedu I had was actually wider. I was skeptik that I could work with a 1in. Flat Iron, but this prouduct was effective to say the least.As I was flat ironing AFTER blow drying it, I didn't see any steamy smoke floating above as I ran the iron through peices of my hair. It proves to me at least, that even at 300 degrees, this iron was somehow delicate on my hair. My biggest fear is heat damage, because why I choose to straighten my hair, I do love my natural curls.How many passes does it take to straighten? Well, I did blow dry my curls  first. It was a straight kind of poofy. Then I ran it slowly through sections of hair. Literally, one pass with this iron was enough.It's so easy to create curls or flip your ends with this iron too! The flat iron has flexible plates and it moves with you. At first I thought my iron was broken because I've never seen this feature, but it's so amazing. My previous Sedu flat iron claimed to flip and curl hair, but it really didn't.The overall concept of this product is just great. I do like it, and somehow, I don't know why, it just feels safe on my curly hair. Like I said before, there isn't a huge surge of steam being exerted as I am running the iron through my hair and this is calming in a sense.I hope this helps women/men, especially those who are wondering is this might work for ethnic hair.",5
"This is the best hair straightener I've ever purchased--and for the price, you simply can't beat it. Better than the Chi.",5
I bought this for my wife and she is very satisfied with it! It come with a glove and a bag which she said was cool but she really liked the Argan oil that comes with it! She has very long hair and she said the oil made her hair silky but not greasy like another product that she had been using- She also said she likes the smell of the oil- It was a great combination- Great gift idea- I can't wait to get home from this deployment so I can feel and smell for myself- Very satisfied overall!,5
"This is a high quality product. I had ordered a straightener from Groupon that was suppose to be a good deal, but it ended up not being the quality product I had anticipated.I was not disappointed with straightener at all. I used it on my little girls extremely curly hair and didn't have to use any product to make her hair keep the straight longer.",5
"I have African-American hair, and I bought this flat iron based on the reviews alone. After the first use, I have to say that everyone was correct! This flat iron is great! It created curls on the ends of my hair with a flick of the wrist! The curls were even nicer than what my curling iron can do. My hair was nice and bouncy and shiny. Best flat iron/hair styler ever and at a great price! Thanks Amazon.",5
"First time I have EVER left a review for a product but this deserves 5 stars! I have tried every top pf the line flat iron, Chi, Rusk, Heat Freak, you name it and this is by far the best flat Iron I have ever purchased, so happy :-D",5
Doesn't pull my hair like my other.  Also the on/off switch is in its proper place and not where it is easily turned off during use! I kept turning off my other flat iron because the button was right where your fingers go.  This one works great! I don't even need the highest setting to get my hair looking great.,5
"I have never owned a flat iron.  I have fine, relatively thin and straight hair...hence no need for a flat iron.  Or so I thought!  I read a hair stylist's blog about curling and styling your hair with a flat iron and wanted to try it out.  However, I didn't want to pay $130 for a product that I wasn't sure would work.  After reading the great reviews on the HSI flat iron I decided to give it a try.  What a great choice!  I ordered it late on a Wednesday evening and received it on Saturday...2 days before promised!  It came just as described.  I've tried a few of the different techniques from the blog on myself and my daughter and they all work perfectly.  I can put a lot of curl in my hair, do a simple flip up or turn down of the ends or just make it really smooth and straight.  It's quite versatile and simple to use.  Which is great because my daughter's and my hair doesn't hold curl well at all.  I normally have to hot roll it or use a curling iron that heats over 400 degrees to get any curl to stay.  This is so much easier than either of those methods and the curl stays all day/night.  So glad I tried this flat iron...well worth it!!",5
I have natural wavy hair and it is very difficult to keep it straight on humid or hot days.  The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline ionic Flat Iron works better than my Chi.  I was a little weary about buying this flat iron because it was not an expensive iron.  It actually straightens my hair and leaves a nice shine.  My Chi usually straightened my hair but within an hour or two the waves came back.,4
"Worked great, took less time to straighten my hair than it did with a curling iron. Heats up fast, so far it is an all around great product!",5
I bought this iron based on other reviews replacing a practically brand new Corolis that I wasn't crazy about (fried my hair in places because of uneven heating). This is a great iron at a great price. Works great on my fine hair. I never owned a chi but feel this is a super alternative to their high prices and seemingly low durability product. I recommend!,5
"My hair is dry, very fine, color-treated and permed so it has a tendency to get very frizzy.A tourmaline ionic flat iron was demonstrated on my hair in a shopping mall last week. I liked how well it tamed my frizz and left my hair soft and shiny. I was all set to buy until I found out it cost $250.00!! I'm not willing to pay that kind of money for a flat iron so naturally I went straight to Amazon.com to find a comparable item for a better price. After reading the reviews of several models, I selected ""HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch.""First of all, the item arrived super fast. It was nicely packaged and included an attractive carrying bag, a heat glove and a trial size bottle of Argan oil. The flat iron has a swivel cord and adjustable temperature control. The Argan oil smelled nice and really helped with my frizz.The HSI flat iron left my hair soft and silky smooth. My teenagers, who have owned at least 5 flat irons between them, say mine works better than any of the ones they have used so far.Don't be fooled by the low price. The HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener gives excellent results and is a great bargain for the price.",5
I bought this flat iron primarily for international trips which require 220 volts. It works as perfect as it does on 110 volts. Amazing how fast it heats up and the level of heat settings it has. A great item to keep your hair in perfect shape.,5
"I purchased this straightner after looking at several different models and their reviews and I am so happy that I chose this straightner. It is very easy to use and I like the fact that it has a little bit of weight to it so I dont feel like Im smashing my hair trying to straighten it. Heats up very quickly! This straightner came with a small sample of the argon oil (which I love), a protective pouch, and heat glove. I have very thick, short hair and have had no issues using the straightner to achieve several different styles! I would recommend this straightner to anyone looking for a new one, you will not be disappointed. It is salon worhty without the high salon price! I Love it!",5
"Great flat iron, I have wavy hair that is on the thick side and it's always hard for me to find a good straightener that will do the job on the first time.  I've had other brands in the past and with my long hair they never seemed to get hot enough or do the job right the first time. This HSI flat iron does a remarkable job on my hair, it leaves it shiny and straight and can even curl the ends and flip it when I want. The 1"" plate is prefect  I just recently got my hair cut short and in many layers and this works like a charm. Straightening my hair has never been easier and look so shiny and good.",5
"I have been using different brands of hair straighteners for a long while. My hair is naturally very thick and curly, and not to mention I have been coloring it for about 7 years. My hair is basically fried and when I try to leave it curly it looks like a giant, unamanagable frizz ball. When I used this straightener it took merley 15 minutes for me to straighten my hair, which is a little bit past my shoulders. With all my prior straighteners it used to take me 30-45 minutes to straighten, and it was never perfectly straight. After using this hair straightener with the Argain Oil afterwards, my hair looked and felt so silky and smooth with no frizz whatsover. I honestly could not believe the transformation that my hair had. I highly recommend this product, especially if your natural hair is nowhere near being straight.It is worth every penny and your hair will look amazing afterwards!",5
I've had this straightener for two weeks and have only used it maybe four times.  With the heat setting only to half it does a pretty good job.  It's heavier than other models my mom and sister own but I like that it feels sturdy.  Has a lot of texture on both sides of the handle.  Heats up in no time and has a red light on top (not inside like other irons) to indicate the iron is on.  The light turns green when it's completely heated up.  So far I really like this straightener.,5
"This was researched by me for about 4 days and then I called the salon that my wife uses. They had a more expensive version of something similar. I looked at it since it was a local purchase and decided that $230 was to much and I also thought the unit was comparable to the one I could get here. I came home and ordered this one and then when it got here had my wife's best friend look at it to tell me what she thought, a big 2 thumbs up. My wife has used it nearly every day since Christmas and she said just last night how much ""she loves that new flat iron."" She has Asian long hair, that seems to want to curl and she always complained that only salons have the right iron for her.If your lady, or you are a lady, with thicker hair or coarse hair this is a great product. Two women who use these daily gave me big props for getting this one. I also coupled the product with the stand to put it in and that was an awesome purchase as well since it stopped clutter on the vanity. This also has a nice pouch it came with and my wife loved that.",5
"I ethnically mixed, when my hair is worn natural I have a fairly tight curl pattern and my frizz is easily controlled with a good conditioner and serum when the weather isn't conducive to my curl. I have quite a bit of hair but the individual strands are not particularly thick.I always start by blow drying my hair with straightening product in it, I use Bumble and Bumble Straight, and Spray de Mode.  Then I flat iron section by section.  This routine with a CHI flat iron gave me smooth shiny hair--not perfect by any means but still fairly weather proof and maintainable between washings.  The same routine with the HSI left me with a coarse looking finish, I attempted to re-do the roots not in individual drops but by looking for coarse pieces while my hair was all down.  A short walk with my dog proved to be too much, though it was cold and dry outside I returned with puffy hair and no ""bump"" in the ends.I purchased this flat iron when it was under $50 dollars I noticed the price recently jumped so I decided to review it.  I think the bad reviews are  accurate, you have to be wary and take your texture into consideration. I will keep it as a back up my last CHI actually lasted 6 years in retrospect spending 50 extra dollars would have been worth it. At $144 I would not buy it unless your hair has very little natural texture (curl).",3
"Great price on a product that is even better than a Chi straightener!  Shipped fast, great product, would definitely recommend.",5
"I have been using an HSI Flat Iron for the past 4 years, I love it so much I'm getting this one for my sister for Christmas and I know she will get just as much use out of it.  The swiveling cord is a fantastic feature and allows you to twist the flat iron in your hands and not have to worry about getting the cord twisted up, and it heats up so fast that quick touch ups are not a problem at all!  My hair has never gotten caught in it (as it has with other flat irons) and it is easy to curl my hair with it as well. Fantastic product!",5
"This would be the second hair straightener I have owned, the first got two uses, and then found the trash, because it fried my hair, tangled in my hair, and earned a well deserved trip to the dump. This one is fantastic! It reaches high enough temperatures to actually work with my naturally curly hair, it overcomes the frizzies, rarely needs a lot of leave in treatment to keep the straighten, and hasn't burned my hair yet. It works like a charm!",5
"I got this flat iron about a month ago and I'm reviewing now because I have used it every day, and I mean heavy useage and it has performed beautifully.  I have it on for very long periods of time because I have very thick african-american hair and I also add in clip in extensions, and this tool does a wonderful job of blending.  It gets my hair super straight and you cannot tell where my real hair ends and the extensions begin.  I've had other flat irons that could not produce the same result without some sort of spray, oil or creme added to the hair prior to use of the flat iron.  Awesome.  Also, the glove was a very useful tool, I used to get burned alot because I have to go very close to the scalp and the glove save me a lot of pain.",5
"I think the HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON is very much worth the money. I was skeptical and really hoped this would tame my wild hair. My hair is natural, long and hair type of 3B,C. I do not wish to add a lot of heat to my hair and even though this flat iron gets super hot, I feel it is better then using the blow dryer, 3 to 4 times of straightening with my old crappy flat iron and then having my hair frizz right away. I 1st used the HSI on the worst day possible, 100% humidity and terrible storms all weekend. My hair did frizz a little but that is expected with the rain and my hair type. I waited til the rain was over and did 1 light flat iron with the HSI, my hair has been perfect ever since. I was going to break down and go back to perming (I perm 2-3 times a yr), but with this straightener I no longer need to perm. I loved the argain oil so much that I added it into my deep conditioner and leave in steps of washing my hair.",5
"My T3 tourmaline flat iron did not survive my recent European trip.  When it died I immediately looked at my options on Amazon.  I selected this HSI 1"" flat iron based on reviews and the incredible price.  I am not disappointed!  While the T3 was somewhat easier to handle the HSI does a much better job with flips at the ends of my long hair.  I have noticed I need to be more careful when working near the ends since I have fine, thin hair.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product.  I especially like the dual voltage, rapid heat time and staying power of my hair style.",5
I read all the reviews and decided to buy this product. It is just ok. Nothing amazing or over the top. Its ok for the price. I was very upset because my free bio silk sample was completely empty. They never filled in. Don't expect this to be the best iron ever. Its is just ok. I have used better ones.,3
"I have used a CHI for the past 4 years and was very happy with it.  However, it quit working so I was on the hunt for another.  I found the HSI on Amazon.  I did some research on it and it had consistantly good reviews.  I purchased it via the reviews as well as the price point.  I am VERY pleased with this flat iron.  Even more so than the CHI I used.  The shipping was fast and everything was in the original packaging.  Thank you for a great product!",5
"I'm asian. I have verrrry thick hair.  I've had all kinds of flat irons - cheap ones that don't work, an expensive one that really worked (sadly, it broke after 4 years) and this mid-range one that is so so.  If I could go back in time, I would have spent the extra money to get the same kind of flat iron I had before. This one takes longer to straighten my hair and sometimes it feels like it's pulling my hair out.",3
"I have always considered myself curling/flat iron challenged having only bad experiences with these types of products in the past. My daughter has owned some popular brand flat irons that quickly lost their appeal. I chose HSI Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron mainly for price and features when compared to similar flat irons. I am more than pleased with this product. I get great results without crimping or burning my hair in the process, and compliments on my new hair style! I recommend this product for both experienced and the inexperienced user.",5
I love this flat iron. It comes with a lovely red case. It heats up quickly and gets the job. Would recommend.,5
"Fast shipment, got it a month before Christmas...it's valued at nearly a 100 dollars, but I scooped it out for a wonderful deal. I must admit that I wasn't going to buy an high-priced product like this...but, I'm glad I took the risk. Thanks Amazon!",5
"What can you say about this product other than it works awesome.I brought this for my wife and comparing to her 13 dollar flat iron well it just doesn't come close.You can tell quality right from the box. It's heavier than the cheap one that's for sure.  Also comes with aNice silk pouch for storage.Anyways the hair comes out like silk. I never seen her hair so straight, and it only took 15min to do vs. usually 45min to an hour and it wouldn't come out as good. Guys if you're looking to get your wife ready to go out faster. This will defiantly give you that.",5
"I purchased this flat iron in February and in November one side quit heating up.  After some confusion over old documentation for warranty information, I did get the item replaced.The replacement I was sent in November just went bad.  Apparently this product only meant to work for 6-9 months and that's it.Now I'm off to shop for another straightener...I do not recommend purchasing.",1
"I purchased this product with high hopes but the first one I received wouldn't heat up correctly or stay on. I was really sad because I had high expectations of this product. I spoke up and the company sent me a replacement. I am so happy I have this flat iron! It took me a little getting used to but is better than any other ones I have used on my long, dark this hair! I love it!! it makes my hair soft and sleek, not dry and strawlike like other flat irons. never again will I buy a cheepy flat iron.",3
"Not happy with this product, at all.  Does not heat up good and tears hair, not smooth like our chi, which we were going to replace, but keep on using since this one is so bad.  I was to late to return, otherwise would have.  I still have it in the box, never going to use it again.",1
"I purchased this product for my wife. She was spending WAY too much time straightening her hair with her old flat iron, so I thought this one would be a good replacement. I was not disappointed, neither was she!! She has greatly reduced the time needed to press her hair as well as the overall health of her hair has improved quite a bit. I highly recommend this product to any husband out there who wants to win a bit of favor with his girl.",5
"I have naturally manageable straight hair.Pros:- Straightens, curls, flips, and creates waves beautifully.- Goes up to 410F.- Comes with a glove and carrying case; great for traveling.- Floating plates so my hair never gets caught or tugged.- Swivel cord- Green light when ready, red when not.Cons:- It takes 2-3 minutes, more or less, to heat up to the highest setting.- Does not automatically turn off... which is bad for those of you that are forgetful",5
"This iron worked GREAT, but only lasted for a month! 2 days ago it just completely stopped working for no reason which is pretty disappointing. I think this works better than my Chi but I had my Chi for about 6 years before it needed replacement...",2
"Such a great product! It did everything I wanted it to do! My hair is very thick, frizzy, and curly! I always have issues finding an iorn that will get hot enough to flatten and smooth my hair. This iron solved my problem! For this iron the price was right! Im so thrilled with this product and all it has done with my hair.Thank you HSI!",5
"I purchased this flat iron through the seller Trending and Trending.  Be aware that this seller is not an authorized seller of HSI Products.  I received my flat iron within the shipping time promised.  It looked great- brand new, everything it came with looked brand new and in good working condition.  However, the flat iron was defective.  It barely heated up, even when put on the highest (410 degree) setting.  I tried getting this product to work on two separate occasions before I contacted HSI Professional to alert them.  HSI was great to work with.  Even though they did not sell me the flat iron, they took my Amazon invoice number and checked the seller and informed me that the seller was not authorized to sell their products.  Then they offered to sell me the same item at the same price I paid for it on Amazon.  HSI Professional's customer service is outstanding!  After going through this ordeal, I took the time to read through all the reviews posted about the seller- Trending and Trending- and noticed that many other people who ordered this same product through this seller, had the same problem as me- the flat iron not heating up.  I would recommend making sure your seller is authorized to sell HSI products before purchasing from them to avoid what I went through.",4
I like the look and it works  great I would  recommend  this flat iron and great price  on Amazon so get it u will be satisfied,5
"Works great, doesn't fry my hair, gives it bounce and curl and a little shine.  Well worth the price - I imagine I'll have this thing for a long, long time.",5
"I Love this flat iron!! I am a African American Female with 4 daughters as well. I have a relaxer the do not. but with this flat iron I am able to give them the straight hair that they want @ times. this flat iron has lessen my time when doing my hair. I swiped and its straight although I still like to do an extra swipe or two! !lol.. I love the digital with the colors, red its off, blue its heating up (about 30-40sec) and green means its ready to be used.",5
This is a great straighter so far. I have no complaints! Glad I purchased it. It issuper smooth and leaves my hair much shinier than my other iron.,4
"I am a black woman with natural (relaxer-free) hair. I like the versatility this offers, but when I choose to wear it straight I want it done with ease and efficiency; and I want it to last. The HSI Pro Ceramic Ionic Flat iron does that. The unit used with the argan oil made my hair straighter and silkier than it's ever been with any flat iron, including the CHI! The effect lasted for over a week, even on some rainy days in Georgia. I am completely satisfied!",5
I would recommend this to anyone who wants a flat iron hair straightener it works very well.  I love it.,5
"I was very excited to receive this flatiron because the majority of the reviews stated it was a great product but I must say that I am disappointed. It does heat up very quickly and gets extremely hot. However, it still takes several passes to get my strands remotely straight... And I don't even have very wavy or hard to straighten hair. It also pulls strands and it can get very painful. Overall, I would say that it works ok and eventually gets the job done but I have definitely used better.",3
"I've had this flat iron for 2 months now. My hair is thin with a slight wave/curl and doesn't typically take a lot of effort to straighten but so far, so good.This flat iron heats quickly, my hair glides through with no pulling like irons I've owned in the past and doesn't require many passes through to make my hair shiny.The iron doesn't open as wide as others and I wish it had an automatic shut-off but that's all minor.It's nice that it comes with a sample argon oil, glove, and a heat pouch. I will review later if anything changes,but overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. .",4
"I wasn't impressed at all with this straightener. The plates are too short, it's heavy and overall bulky. Doesn't straighten any better than the average flat iron.",2
Never used a flat iron before.  Does a great job and is easy to use. Received as promised. Appreciated the free sample of argan oil.,5
"Great flatiron.  I bought this one because my CHI, which I loved and had for five years died.  I didn't quite have the budget for the CHI, or I would have bought another one.  So, I decided to go with the HIS on account of the good reviews I read online.  It's a great product.  No regrets here.",5
"This isn't the first time I purchase one of these.  This is actually the third one i have purchased, not because they have broken down, but because my family likes them so much they ask if they can get one as well.",5
"Works exactly as I expected, and the price is very acceptable, compared to the ones with more than 100 dollars.",5
"After spending hours of reviewing and comparing different products, I decided to purchase this one because of all the good reviews and the price. I am glad I did! I was debating between the Chi and Babyliss which I am sure they're good products, I decided to buy HSI because I wanted high quality yet affordable. I have chemically processed hair (Keratin treated over a year ago) and my hair is now weak and damaged so I wanted something gentle on the hair and I can say that this iron is definitely it for my hair type. I have medium length hair and after blow drying my hair, it took me about 15 minutes to iron my hair. It is easy to hold, the case is cute and the argan oil sampler that came with it was great so I am thinking of buying it too. I recommend this product and after all it's really not that expensive so you won't lose much really...give it a try!",5
"I am so happy I purchased this hair straightener . . . couldn't be more pleased with my results and how easy it is to use.  It arrived on time and beautifully packaged - and I even got an argan oil sample and was pleasantly surprised by the heat-protection glove that came in the box, too.  I have been using this to get curls and it works exceedingly well.  Heats up in no time at all (seriously: I plug it in when I begin to brush my teeth and by the time I'm done with that, I am ready to use it to do my hair!) andthe curls are springy, shiny, bouncy, dent-free and so long lasting.  It is so easy to use and that is saying a lot as I'm certainly not a professional and am a busy working mother of three little kids with minimal time - this helps me get the look I want and keep it for days at a time since the curls I create with this really last.  I love that the design ensures you don't get dents in your hair, whether you are going for a sleek look, flip or bouncy curls.  Thanks HSI for the great service and great product!  I already recommended it to a friend who loved my new hairstyle and wanted to see what I used to achieve it!",5
This was my second purchase with this product...I would recommend to anyone who desires to flat iron their hair.,5
"I needed a straightener after losing mine after having it for almost 10 years. This seemed a good alternative to an ultra-expensive one. I have fine hair, and relative to this straightener, I'm glad. It heats up very quickly, has an easy on/off button and temperature dial, and it does a good job straightening my hair. I could not imagine having thick or curly hair and getting it as straight as I would like, however. Also, it curls under the ends of my hair if I don't hold it just right, which I personally don't like.Overall, good, inexpensive buy for now.",4
I'm giving this straightener 3 stars because it is a great straightener but I still have some frizz with it & it does not curl my hair,3
I have thick wavy hair & I hate styling my hair. I literally wash my hair take the tangles out & let it dry & just let it be . I thought I'd try this & love it in 10min my hair is perfectly straight. I normally have no patience for this but it's so fast & easy. I love it!,5
"Although I rely heavily on customer reviews, I very rarely write them myself. However, this straightener is so good I can't not write a review. I have tried/owned at a minimum of 5-10 different straighteners, both inexpensive and high end and this is the BEST. Amongst those are Helen of Troy, CHI, Conair, Wigo, Ken Paves, Bio-Ionic, and FHI. Up until I tried this straightener, FHI was my favorite and CHI was my least. I have normal/coarse/wavy hair-not crazy frizzy, but not pretty either. This straightener is the best in my opinion because:-it heated up very fast-has an on/off switch (which I didn't care about until I had a toddler)-heats to a higher temperature then my other straighteners, yet I do not feel like it ""burns"" my hair-my first test of any straightener is to squeeze it closed and check to see it closes tight/secure/no light can be seen between plates...it was perfect-my hair never got caught/pulled where the plates are attached-for the first time, my hair still smelled good/clean..not stinky/burned being masked by a clean hair smellIf this straightener died in a month, I would absolutely buy it again. It is worth every penny!",5
Quick product . Wife loves it... Happy wife happy life get hot quickly... Wife says the hotter the better... She had to turn it down it's so hot,5
I was looking for a flat iron for my 11 year old daughter who asked for one for X-Mas. I did not want to spend $100 for something that she would use occasionally. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It heats up quickly and works great.,5
I got 2 Chi's off of Amazon and they both broke within a month.  I have had this straightener for a year and a half now and it is AMAZING! It is one of my best amazon purchases,5
Works much better than the flat iron I paid a lot more for.I wear my hair straight much more often now that I use this iron.,5
Awesome flat iron! !!.... GETS hot fast!! And it easy to use..It also comes with a glove. .. because like I said they get very Hot...I love it!!!...also came really fast. ..,5
"I love this product.  I have used many brands and types of flat irons and these are by far the best I have ever used. Great on the hair, no burning, keeps a great temperature, and does not give your hair that dull look.  I highly recommend!!",5
I b;ought this for my daughter and she's EXTREMELY pleased saying it works very well. Enjoys the added bonus of a bag for travel purposes.I'd personally give it 5 stars based on price compared to comparable irons / i received it in a very timely fashion and boxed- store quality.ALL GOOD- I'd buy from this vendor again.,5
It exceeded my expectations! This flat iron works miracles for thick African-American hair & it gives your hair body for days !,5
"Bought this flat iron about three months ago. I did not want to write a feedback until I have used an item for at least a couple of months.This flat iron does not disappoint. Very easy to use. I don't think that the on button's placement was a problem. Heats up fast and leaves your hair shiny and with more volume than you first started.And with a flick of your wrist, you can do curls with this, too. Bouncy and perfect ones!The price for this is very reasonable. And works as good if not better as the very expensive ones.Hopefully this one would last for a long time like my last one.",5
"I have a lot of fine hair. On my old straightener, it would take about 40 minutes to do the job but on this iron, it's a little over 20 mins. Love it; just what I needed!",5
"I intended to replace my flat iron with the Chi brand but ordered this one by accident.  I like it as much as the Chi, but wish that they would find a way to put the ""on"" button on the outside.  I'm always worried about burning myself when I turn it off and have to put my hand inside to do so.  Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars.",4
"I have very thick hair but this straightener, with adjustable temperature settings, gets my hair extremely straight. I've been using this model for about 6 months and have been very happy with it. It comes with a nice travel bag and a glove to use to protect your hand when your hair gets hot. The straightener is also compatible with different kinds of electricity so you won't need a converter if using the product during international travel. (Just an adapter to fit the plug into the wall). There is no reason to pay a lot of money for a straightener when you can get this one and have beautiful straight hair very quickly.My only negative on this product is that it doesn't have an automatic shut off switch if it's left on too long. You just have to remember to turn it off when you are finished styling your hair.",5
I love this straigtener and the fact that you can set the heat setting and curl your hair with it. I feel like I'm doing less damage to my hair by setting it on a lower heat for some styling days vs. my CHI that only had one setting: ON. I love this products so far except that it does lose heat. About halfway through my straightening days I have to set it down and do another task to let it heat back up. It does heat up quickly though so it just takes a minute or two to get back to the heat setting I have it on. That's my only complaint so far. I would still definitely recommend this- great price and product. It works well and leaves my hair healthier and shinier than my CHI.,4
"I have type 4a hair that has not been chemically altered and got this as a trial run to see if the reviews were really real and yes they were! I use grape seed oil and tresseme heat protection and whenever I do press my hair (once a month) it lasts for 4 to 6 days without needing a touch up to  and people can't believe that I didn't perm my  hair it gets so straight! Heats up in record time, like within 40 seconds,g gets extremely hot so be careful. The oil that comes with it is pretty darn good but I been using grape seed oiand um kinda hooked. All my sisters are going to get one thanks to the results they see.",5
I love this flat iron.  I have very coarse hair and this flat iron does a great job of cutting through the curls without drying out my hair.  And I love the automatic shut off feature.,5
Iron is great and Blue Novelties has the best customer service.  I will do as much business there as I can!  Thanks so much!,5
This is a good product. I would keep the temperature low as it heats up very quick. The only drawback is sometimes my hair gets stuck on the top of the straightenet.,4
"So the flat iron works fine - but I was surprised about how thin it was which means it takes a long time to do my hair.  I had been using another model that was wider and it went much quicker.  I suppose if you are used to the think ones, it won't be a surprise for you.Also, in their product description they said you would get a free sample of their straightening oil - I did not receive any oil.",3
"The straightener arrived quickly.  The difference in my hair is amazing.  My daughter has long thick hair and it still doesn't take half the time that her other straightener took. Love it, love it, love it!",5
I have owned 4 flat irons in the past 8 or so years. My last two were CHI's. The Chi gets extremely hot and was causing a lot of damage on my hair. I needed something that would get my hair as straight as my CHI but wouldn't do as much damage on my hair. The HSI is perfect. It has temperature controls -- I like that I can get my hair straight without burning it to a crisp.I have natural african american hair and this straightener gets my hair as straight as those who have relaxers.,5
"Hello!I decided to buy a flat iron when my Gold n' Hot one stopped working. She did wonders on my hair, but it worked a little too well, meaning that I was always worried about the iron damaging my hair.So when I chose this one (After reading many reviews and watching them on youtube) I was very excited. I have only used it once, but it works very nice for the price.Is not a super fancy iron but seems to be working pretty well.Btw. I have relaxed hair. Very good for the roots.",4
I have really damaged hair. I do a lot of bleaching and dyeing and general fiddling with my hair and this is the first flat iron that really smooths out the frizz and makes it look like I haven't made a hobby out of changing my hair color. It's a really good product at a really good price.,5
"I bought a highly rated straightener from walmart and her hair was a fluff ball on the first day of school:( I bought this one months later because of the reviews and it is great!!! One pass down a strand of hair and voila the hair is straight and flat, It's amazing, I recommend this to anyone. It is skinny but it is so efficient!!!! Works Wonders",5
I have very thick hair and I love this flat iron. It heats up quickly and works great. I highly recommend this flat iron and believe me I have tried them all.,5
"I would've given if five stars, but the on/off switch and heat dial is located in the interior of the iron.",4
"Bought it for my girlfriend. She normally buys the expensive ones, i didnt tell her what i paid for it until after she used it. She swore it was a top dollar straightener. She like it better than all the other chi irons she has had",5
"I have course wavy/ curly hair, this straightener makes it smooth and straight in one pass! I love this one!",5
"This straightener heats up quickly and straightens nicely. The only things I dislike are that the light that says ""Off"" will blink for days on end even if it is powered off and plugged in. I have to say this doesn't do curls as well as my Chi did, but for the price and what comes with it, you truly can't beat it.Overall, I'd repurchase. It does a fair job of straightening.",4
It beyond my expectations I would recommend it. It gives my hair a nice shine and it doesn't dry it out.,5
"This is my first one inch flat iron and I've only used it twice, but immediately I was pleased.  It handles well in my hands.  I like the way the settings are on the inside so your fingers don't bump into them while you're using it.  It heats up very fast and I thought I'd need it on the high setting because of my daughters natural/thick hair, but I didn't.  That thing was smooth like butter (close to the roots) and straightened perfectly with no snagging.  I also didn't have any issue with the cord or cord length.  My daughter did not complain and believe me, she would have if she felt the heat get too close.  I get it.  Highly recommend.  FYI, I use it for my 6yr natural/thick hair and my hair which has an agave smoothing treatment.",5
"For years I've used the Hai brand and absolutely loved it.  I decided to try HSI this time and I'm a little dissapointed.  First off the ""Travel size"" Argan Oil is really a sample size.  They really shouldn't use it as a selling point.  It takes me longer to use this iron then my Hai one.  I'm tempted to send this one back but don't want to deal with shipping it back.  Oh well, it does the job for now.",3
"I rated this flat iron a 5-star because it surpassed my expectations. I needed a flat iron that I could bring internationally and use back in the states. I've used this flat iron faithfully in Paris, Lyon and the United States and it has worked flawlessly in all. The flat iron gets hot fast and glides over your hair. It doesn't snap, fry or dry out your hair like other flat irons I've previously used. It leaves my hair moisturized, bone-straight and light-weight. The only thing I'd like to mention is that I haven't tried the Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment because it was so tiny. There can't be much more than two uses in there. The oil, however, didn't negatively affect the use or my opinion of the flat iron because that is not why I bought the flat iron....to use the oil. The pouch and gloves are nice touches; although I end up using the glove with a curling wand I own, the pouch is very handy when I decide to travel with my flat iron on the rare but existent occasions. I have recommended this to all the women I know, I even may purchase one for my mother. It is well worth the money!",5
"I love this flat iron, it has the adjustable heat settings, and fits comfortable in my hand ( I have RA).",5
This the best flat iron I have bought. The thing I like the best is that it doesn't pull your hair.,5
"This product heats up fast and works well. It is light and easy to use. However, I do have to run it through my hair a few times to get it completely straight. But, I have very wavy hair, so this is the usual course of action for me. Overall, I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.",4
"This turned out to be a great buy. The straightener works great, and you never get the feeling of your hair being burnt. It comes with a cute case to store it in. I have very thick medium blonde hair and it straightens it within 3-5 strokes around my head (which is great for me.) I am impressed with it. I would recommend it to anyone. My hair still feels and looks healthy.",5
"This is an awesome flat iron, especially for the price.  It also works very well to curl my hair.  I'm pleased.",5
This is by far one of the best ever.Rapid response and well designed such that you don't have to worry about burning your fingers and workmanship is top notch!,5
I bought this a few years ago after my CHI iron died. I like that this iron has adjustable heat. It has held up well. I liked it enough to recommend to my mother.,5
This product is everything that I hoped it would be.  I have crazy curls and they are extremely difficult to tame.  I have tried other flat iron's and none of them could keep my locks straight for an entire day.  This flat iron does and outstanding job without having to use the aid of hairspray or any other product with it.  I give it 10 thumbs up!!!!,5
"I had a flat iron already but it always left me wishing it would get just a bit hotter and glide just a bit more smoothly. Well, this HSI product does the trick. My hair is thick and while it's not coarse, it's not fine either. It can be a struggle to get all of it flattened on the sides and curled just right on the ends. With the HSI I have it smoothed out in mere minutes. I love it. If you have never owned a flat iron or if you have one but wonder what all the fuss is about, invest in this one. You won't regret it. Customer service was exceptional as well. My order arrived promptly and everything was as promised. Kudos to this stellar seller :~)",5
Works great. I like the temperature control although it it could be a little more accessible and easier to read. Heats evenly and quickly.,5
Came fast..works EXCELLENT. VERY VERY well made. not cheap at all... my fianc is picky and she loves it. .,5
I bought this straightener as an extra for travelling. I have very thick and curly hair. This one does an excellent job of straightening hair. temperature control is a great idea. It helps when i am straightening not so wet hair. Hair looks pin straight and shiny!!!Really I will not use any other straightener except this one.  Another great feature of this product voltage conversion. It is a huge plus for me. Especially when I travel to India!!! Not only  i am enjoying this product. My daughter uses it and loves it.,5
Got this for my wife as an alternative to CHI. Very happy with the performance. The glove was a nice bonus as the iron can get hot as intended.,5
"I love this flat iron! I just got a keratin treatment done on my thick, frizzy, curly hair at a salon and I wanted to be able to keep up the look at home. First time I used it, my hair came out silky smooth straight.Be warned...even at the medium setting it gets very hot and steams a bit when you iron your hair...but once I use it my hair actually stayed stick straight and soft for a few days in between washes. Very happy with it =)",5
It works better than any flat iron I have owned. It is quick which makes it practical for me. I am so happy I purchased it!,5
"I bought a Chi flat iron from Costco maybe 5 years ago and the cord shorted out.  I was looking for a replacement and didn't want to spend a ton of money.  I like that this one has the adjustable heat but I set it near the high end and haven't touched it since.  I have lots of fine hair that tends to frizz.  This iron seems to not pull through my hair as easily as the Chi but it definitely gets the job done.  I usually use this when my hair is dry but tried with damp hair the other day and it was pretty amazing.  I would purchase again but hope it will last a few good years.  No problems with the cord or anything else.  Oh, the heat safe bag it comes with is great.  I used to iron in the morning and head off to work while the iron cooled and then put away when I got home.  No need with the little bag and I should have bought the heat safe bag years ago.  4 stars due to the pull through the hair not being as smooth as the Chi.",4
"I am absolutely thrilled with this five star appliance, because in my opinion it really is the Rolls Royce of hair straighteners, (I am British). It has all the bells and whistles that anyone could wish for, and does the job excellently and quickly.  This item is top quality in every respect, and I never travel without it - even to Europe.  I love the protective travel bag together with all the other stellar features, and highly recommend this professional hair straightener.  It makes such a positive difference to my hair and therefore my general appearance.Gramcrackergran, CA.",5
"This flatiron is just what I was looking for. It heats quickly and (this is the part I love best) it has a variable heat button! Not all flatirons have this option and can really fry your hair. It's very sturdy and well constructed, and my hair glides through it without any pulling or snagging. Very happy with my choice!",5
"I recently bought this product to replace a competitor brand, and I have to say I am very happy. I really like the adjustable heat feature, and its easy to use with the swiveling cord. I have long hair, and was able to straighten it quickly, and this product left my hair shiny and straight for two days. Heats up quickly and maintains heat.I received my purchase in a timely fashion, and it came with a sample of HSI argan oil, glove, and pouch, which was appreciated.  Thanks!",5
"First time I used it, I hated it! Now I use it every day! It makes my hair look so soft and silky! Good buy!",4
"""Love it works great. "" fast service great product just as  described  love the look I get when I use it",5
"First let me say that I NEVER leave reviews because I figured no one read them.  Well I read them and I rely on honest feedback so I hope this helps someone.  I use to think I had to spend in the upper 100's for a flat iron...but after a poor choice in a prior pricey flat iron I saw the reviews on this and decided to take a chance, besides I could always return it.This is a FANTASTIC flat iron and good for your budget as well.  It feels good in the hand, equal weight distribution, heats super fast and the buttons and display are easy to read.  Has a good range of heat settings also. Handle stays cool to the touch, for those of you who ""two hand"" it.  I have processed hair and this smooth's all the damage that is done on my hair. Also does a great job at curling.  Gives my fine hair a good boost of ""umph"".  You won't be disappointed!",5
"This is my first experience with a flat iron, although I have watched my daughter with hers for years.  I am totally happy and love the quality of this product.It was shipped quickly and arrived before I had expected it!",5
"Great quality especially for the price! I have moderately thick hair and it usually takes me about 30-45 minutes to straighten it, but this morning I spent no more than 15 minutes and my hair feels so silky.  I've owned plenty of flat irons but this one definitely tops the list. The travel case and hot glove are awesome bonuses that I haven't received before in other similar price flat irons.",5
"THIS FLAT IRON LIVES UP TO THE 5 STARS RATING. I HAVE REVIEWED HUNDREDS OF FLAT IRON AND DECIDED TO CHOOSE THIS HSI.THE ONLY REASON THIS IS GETTING A 4 STARS, IS THE RESET BUTTON STOP WORKING. I ONLY HAVE THIS FLAT IRON FOR 1 MONTH.",4
I can't say enough about this flat iron!  I have purchased NUMEROUS flat irons for both myself and my two daughters. Most with price tags over $120.  My daughter needed to replace her Solia flat Iron I bought her about 6 years ago.  Mine is about 6 months older than hers and still working great but certainly wearing a bit and will probably need to be replaced at some point since the black cord cover is slipping and exposing the colored wires. Solia WAS the best flat iron we had ever used at the lowest price about $90...UNTIL I purchased this HSI.  While looking for something my daughter could use for a few months until I could justify another $90+ purchase (we had already spent enough on her for Christmas and college tuition was due) I found this and decided to take a chance since the huge number of reviews and the overall 5 ***** rating. Even if she didn't like it was going to be a great back up when mine crashed.  I was very pleasantly surprised. After using just once I quickly ordered another to be sent to my daughter in college. I also had my sister place an order for her daughter as well.  GREAT Product! Thinking I should purchase an extra because I'm sure this price will go up with all the 5 star reviews. THANK YOU!!!,5
"I bought this for my teenage daughter who straightens her wavy hair every day. She's gone through 3 CHI flat irons, and most recently I bought her a very expensive GHD flat iron. She hated the GHD, saying it didnt get hot enough to properly straighten her hair, so we returned it. We saw this highly rated one on Amazon, and decided to try it. I'm so glad we did. She LOVES this flat iron. Her hair is smooth and shiny and super healthy looking after she straightens it with this flat iron. For the price, you can't go wrong with this one! Definitely buy it, it's so worth it!!",5
I thought all irons were the same until I tried this one. Couldn't be happier!Totally transformed my hair! Love it!!!!!,5
I really like this iron. I have wavy hair and this iron i s hot and does the job well. Made nice and lite to handle. The 1 inch is perfect for my thick hair. I would recommend this straightener. I have use many others and this beats them all.,5
Best flat iron ever!! I'm a natural girl and my hair is bone straight after I use this straightener! Love the oil that came with it also!,5
"I love this product! The description is exactly what I wanted and what I got. The cord is long, the straightener itself is lightweight and perfectly sized. The straightener plates are so smooth, it doesn't pull my hair. I love it!",5
This is a fabulous flat iron . I have very particular teenagers and they love it! Heats up fast. Highly recommended.,5
Love this straightener.  Works as good as my old Amika if not better.  Great price as well.  This is a winner!,5
This is the first flat iron I've ever tried.  I love the way it leaves my hair....so soft and shiny!,5
This iron is as close to my stylist's as I've ever been able to purchase for less than $100. I think it's a great price for this quality product.,5
"All I can say, is WHY did I wait so long to buy this?!?!?!I have wild, curly hair, along with extensions for length, and this straightener fixes my '80's party hair every morning into something sleek and tamed.  Without this straightener, I'd be a total '80's throwback, unintentionally.Now, I need to buy two more of these so my daughter's stop stealing it out of my bathroom!(The glove is awesome for those of us with two left feet..err...hands.  And the oil included was a bonus, it's an oil I already use and love.)This is TOTALLY worth the price, BUY IT!!!",5
I love my straightener.  It works great.  The best thing about it is that I can use it to curl the bottom of my hair without using a curling iron.,5
"I bought this based on all the great reviews, but after using it for a few weeks i don't think it is really all that special. It works, but i had higher expectations. Here is what i have noticed so far:Pros: Adjustable heat settings. That's nice, but i think that should be standard on a flat iron in this price range.It does work and does straighten my hair, so i guess that counts as a ""pro.""Cons: There is no light to indicate whether it was on or off. I had a hard time getting it to turn on at first and had to just touch it to see if it was warming up or not.Also, the plates don't line up exactly evenly. It's not a big deal when you have a large enough chunk of hair in it, but when straightening the front layers of my hair there are a few small chunks and either they will just fall out if there are in the gap between the plates or else there will be a few hairs where the plates do touch and it will pull when the rest slides easily through the plates.It's not a big enough deal to me to return it, but if i were to do it over again i would not purchase this model.",2
"I purchased this for my wife as a gift.  Here is what she had to say about this item:""This hair straightener works well, is durable, looks nice and does what it is supposed to do.  It is a quality hair straightener.  My only criticism is that it did not include a heat proof case to secure it in immediately after use.  My previous one had such a case, which I'm glad I saved in order to use with this one.  That's the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars.""",4
Works great!  The only thing I didn't like was there is no light or anything to let you know if it's turned on.  Also it would be great if it had auto shutoff.,4
"This is a much higher level product than I have been using, truly Professional Grade from my experience so far.A bit heavier than my old ones, but much better made too.Still learning what temperature setting works for me. All my old ones were just one temperature.Very nice storage bag, too. It came with a glove, which I'm still wondering what to do with. Maybe some pros use a glove?I ordered this originally just for use on an overseas trip, because it is dual voltage, but it is really nice and a great price so I'm happy I did.",5
I love this straightener and the accessories included.  It heats up very quickly. It also has a long electrical cord which is helpful to me.,5
I have very thick and coarse curly hair and this flat iron did the job! My hair was shiny and straight after an hour and a half (approximately the time to straighten my frizzy lion mane). I am extremely happy with the results!,5
This is an excellent flattening iron.  It is well made and has worked better than any other that I have used. I would recommend this specific iron if looking for one.  Amazingly priced too!,5
Bought as a Christmas gift for my wife she obsolutely loves it!I wasn't sure what to look for in an iron so I based my decision on feedback I noticed this was highly recommended I'm glad i did!!,5
"LOVE this Iron. On/Off switch is located between plates, heats up quickly, cools down quickly once unplugged or turned off, nice smooth iron plates, has a nice temp. dial so you may adjust. Well worth the price!!""",5
This is a great product for a steller price!!!  i would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a flat iron!!,5
I absolutely love this hair flat iron. I have used it a handful of times and definately notice the difference in quality from my prior cheaper flat iron.,5
We have been very pleased with the quality of this product and are happy we purchased it for our daughter.,5
"I just bought this flat iron because my hair was looking ""fried"" from the iron I had been using.  With this one, my hair is soft & silky!  I am thrilled with my purchase and you sure can't beat the price.  Do not hesitate to buy this flat iron.",5
"This is the first negative review I've ever written. So disappointed in this iron. It pulls out a strand of my hair with each pass. When it arrived, it looked as if it had been used before - there were small scrapes on the plastic around the ceramic plates and even the plates themselves had several small nicks in them. Now that I think about it, I was probably shipped an iron that someone else had used and returned.I was surprised that my iron was so faulty, especially after so many other people had given glowing reviews, but there are also MANY people posting negative reviews like mine. BUYER BEWARE!",1
"I thought I would upgrade and try a new flat iron.  I looked at the reviews and decided to try this one.  I used it the first time and noticed that it heats quickly, so was pleased with that, but it pulls my hair and it hurts!  Tried it a couple of more times thinking it just needed to ""break in"", but it did the same thing.  It's like my hair gets caught on something.  I tried to adjust how I did things, but It kept happening.  Let's be honest here, Folks.  This is a flat iron and it doesn't take a degree to use one!  I put it away for a few months, but decided to try it again.  Maybe I was doing something wrong.  So tried it again and got the same result.  It pulls my hair.  I'm selling it on a garage sale.  Done with it.",2
"I have been searching for a good flat iron for a few years now. One that didn't cost a lot and did what it says(flat iron hair). I had always seen the Chi flat iron advertised at the mall for $100.00 and wanted it but thought it was overly priced. So this year I started looking on amazon for one and found theHSI Professional ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron, plus it was on sale. I read the reviews watched them on YouTube and decided to order one for myself. I am so happy I did. It works as well as the Chi and cost half the price. I give it a 5 star rating and have recommended it to all my family and friends. Thanks HSI I have truly enjoyed your product.Dawn W.",5
"I really love this. I have naturally thick, curly hair and it works great. Other flatirons I have tried leave my hair kind of stiff. This one leaves it so much more smoother,  moveable, and bouncy.",5
"I bought this after seeing all the thousands of positive reviews. I went into it not sure what to expect, since the negative reviews did seem to have merit. I guess my opinion of the product falls somewhere in between. I have wavy-ish, frizzy-ish, long red hair. Normally I just let it air dry naturally, but recently got bangs and wanted them to look sleek. I had an 80 Euro straightener from Europe that I recently gave to my sister so I was looking for a replacement. I bought this one at the same time as a Conair Infiniti straightener that I found for $15 to compare the two. I ended up keeping this one because it was just enough better than the Conair.At high temperatures, this straightener is pretty great. My bangs get straight in no time, and stay that way for at least a day. There's no frizz and my hair doesn't ever get caught, which was a big must for me. However, it still takes ages to get the rest of it straight, and the wavier parts by my crown don't get straight no matter what. And forget about using this at a lower temperature setting - nothing happens unless it's more than 3/4 of the way to the maximum. But that being said, it was cheap and it works to straighten my bangs.I do wonder about the product's authenticity - the sticker warning attached to the outlet plug has some ungrammatical English - ""If it does not turn on. Press firmly on reset button"". I would expect that a real $200 straightener would pay closer attention to its labels. Also, while the box has a picture of a small glass jar of Argan oil, what was actually contained in the box was a one-use sealed pouch. So that was a bit disappointing, although many of the reviewers said they'd found the same thing. So for $40 this was a good purchase, but I'm sure there are much better straighteners out there. This one hasn't revolutionized my life or anything like the positive reviews made me think it would.",3
"This appears to be the only full size dual voltage flat iron on the market right now. There aren't any switches you need to flip for the voltage - it automatically switches on its own.I used it both at home (PA) as well as in Rome (with a simple plug converter, NOT voltage converter since that wasn't needed), and it performed just fine.Comparing this to the CHI, which is what I use at home, I would say that this flat iron is much heavier, and fuller around the handle part where you hold it rather than the CHI. It's not that big of a deal, but worth mentioning. Also, sometimes it felt like my hair was being pulled. I stopped using the iron and looked at it to see what might be causing the pulling, but nothing was obvious.My end results were the same as with using the CHI, so I was pleased with that. Overall I'm happy that I purchased it, but will use it only as a backup to my CHI, and for travel.",4
Great for my daughter! She has curly frizzy hair and this straightens fast and smooth! Would recommend to anyone looking!,5
"I wish that the width was a bit bigger. Maybe a 2 inch, but it does it job well enough.",4
"Does not have self turn off as described. Fair + quality for the price. Warms up dairly quickly. If I purchased @ brick and mortar store, would have returned but did not want to deal w/ return shipping.",3
"It Is easy to use it, but it makes my hair dry alittel bit. Over all I liked it too much :)",3
"I switched from a cheap Hot Tools (which worked great but broke quickly) to HSI, which I heard was amazing.  I have very thick hair and I think since this is such a small iron, it takes longer to striaghten my hair.  I'm also noticing that it's damaging the ends of my hair much more quickly than my previous flat iron.  My friend has a larger CHI which works incredibly on my hair, I was hoping for the same but I don't know if this flat iron is meant for thick wavy hair.Also, the box was obviously opened before I received it and the Argon Oil was missing.  I contacted Amazon today and let them know.",3
"Coming from the boyfriend's perspective, if you want to make the girl happy, just give in and give her what she wants and you'll be happy.This straightener was on massive price reduction for Black Friday.  I'm talking like, once was $200, now it's 50 bucks.  I pulled the trigger and the gf is soooooo thankful.  That's right boys, a good straightener gift can make you a better (and more happy) boyfriend.",5
Paid $140. I have had it for 6 years and works very well.  Still heating up a storm.  Highly recommend.,5
I have naturally straight hair so I was just looking for one to curl my hair and it works great. It heats up very quickly which I love. Great packaging and great product. Already referred this to a friend who now also bought.,5
"I'm half black and half white, with hair typical of that mix. If I turn this iron all the way up and straighten small sections at a time, it'll get the job done nicely. It's not bad. BUT, if your hair is like mine, you can do much better than this. I had a ""one n only"" flat iron that gave me two wonderful years before the plates started to burn out, and thought this ""professional"" iron would be an inexpensive upgrade. I'm going to hold onto this for now, but next time I have $60 to spare, I'm getting a clone of my previous iron and giving this one to a Caucasian friend who can get more use out of it. Btw, IF YOU'RE FULLY BLACK, DO NOT GET THIS. You need an iron that goes up to 450 degrees. Doing my [black] sister's hair with this flat iron is no different from running a comb through it, except the comb actually serves a purpose. POSITIVES: The packaging is super nice, includes a silk sleeve to keep the iron in; works well for touching up hair that is already straight-ish but needs some extra polishing.",3
"Actually the Five Star rating was given by my wife, who is ecstatic with this item.She states it is everything she was looking for and then some.When Mama's happy, I'm happy!",5
"Wishing I would have spent more $ to get a better iron. It wasn't smooth and it just didn't feel right. Didn't leave my hair shiny and sleek like I wanted. The reviews are stellar, and it's not a bad iron. But I'm used to top of the line irons, and this one just isn't that. For the money, it's great. But you gotta spend $100 or more to get a great one. I returned this one and got a Sedu.",3
"Pros:Heats up fastGets hair straight- it is a flat iron after all :DMy hair was no staticy after using it!Adjustable temp setting- it is a dial, so no exact temp setting.Cons:No auto shut off.It feels like it pulls your hair when you are running it through it, and it hurts. And for this I'm returning it. I just feel like it's hurting my hair more by that pulling action.",2
"The flat iron is too bulky. And the switch is in an awkward place. Also the light to see that you have it turned on is hard to see. I would not buy this flat iron again. It works for now, but I'd rather have a more slender model that is a little longer and not so awkward",3
"I have used a Paul Mitchell straight iron in the past but didn't like the new model. I have purchased two other irons, only to be unsatisfied.  I had never used HSI before but thought the price was right. I received it very quickly, even over a holiday weeken, and love how smoothly it glides over my hair. It heats evenly and doesn't give my hair the crimp marks other irons can tend to leave.",5
I've gotten CHI and other high end straighteners all my life. This one works SO MUCH BETTER! Takes less time to fix my hair and get it looking great! Love that this has different heat settings. Does not take long to heat up either. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.,5
"If you have natural afro hair...then this will look like any other flat iron product you have used.It's okay.If you have chemical processed hair or a different texture besides afro,then your hair may be silky straight.",2
"This is the first straightener I've ever bought and I got it mainly for my mixed daughter's crazy curly/frizzy hair. I can't believe how well it straightens her hair! My only complaint is that the light goes back and forth from red to green and isn't consistent, so there's obviously a malfunction with that part of the item. But it doesn't interfere with the fact that the iron heats up quickly and is very efficient in doing its job. I will continue to use it for my daughter and myself.",4
"I had a Revlon before this one that worked great but needed to replace.  Saw this one and saw the high price and reviews, but I give it a 3 because it didn't outperform my Target one.  Says it is suppose to be professional but it is not.  It does straighten, but not any better than other cheaper ones.",3
I scored such a great deal on this flat iron! I am excited!  It straightens and curls like a dream. Its like the Cadillac of the hair straighteners! Heats up super fast!,5
I did a lot of research before making this selection. I feel like it is the best value out there for a quality flat iron.,5
"Can't believe how great this is.  I've used Chi for years and was convinced that if I tried to buy a less expensive product I'd be disappointed.  But a friend recommended this, and I am amazed--for half the price this things is just as good if not better than my Chi!  In fact, I like the feel of it better--the part you hold in your hand when you use it has texture--grooves--so it's easier to handle without slipping.  Hair doesn't get caught in it, you don't feel like you have to ""squeeze"" to get a good effect...I LOVE THIS.",5
I've had no problem so far with this product. It was easy to use and I love the quality. I recommend it to anyone with thick hair.,4
"It's a good straightener for someone who already has straight hair (I use it for kinks and getting some waves). It's no Chi, but for the price, it was exactly what I needed. I really like the little pouch it comes in too - i travel a lot and I feel better about packing it like this!",3
Awesome Hair straightener!  Love it!  Better than a CHI! I would highly recommend this product!  Great value and wonderful quality!,5
"After my chi broke I was hesitant getting a new flat iron. This is every bit as good as a chi. It heats up fast, and works great!",5
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Best straightener I've ever owned and it was a great price. My hair is very fine but very curly but with 2 strokes it was super straight !! Would definitely recommend this product.,5
Quick delivery on a top knotch quality product! I love it!  It also seems to make my hair healthier and softer looking and feeling!! Thank you for offering such an amazing price! I know they typically retail for $200 and up.  I recommend this seller and would buy again! :),5
"These flat irons actually make my hair feel healthier AFTER using them than before!  Heats up very quickly and never feels as if it's damaging my hair.  It glides so smoothly.  The 1"" size lets me get close to my scalp to flatten out the new growth between relaxer touch-ups.  I used to get fly-away hair and static with my old ceramic flat irons, but not with these.  The argon oil pack that came with it worked very well - need to find more!  I thought it would be too oily, but it wasn't.  I have long African-american relaxed hair, just so you'll know.",5
"Well worth the money, I'm very pleased with performance of this flat iron. With this product my hair stays straight, with my flat iron I purchased over the counter it didn't perform as well. I would highly recommend this flat iron! Love it!",5
"Great for the price, way cheaper than any retail establishment. Works great, I use it all the time... No problems here!",5
this flat iron saved my life!! not really but it has saved me a ton of money because I can do my hair myself AND it looks professionally done. It makes my hair so silky smooth and straight. I was hesitant because i have coarse hair. But this flat iron works wonders. I wish i had purchased it sooner.,5
"This flat iron is everything I hoped it would be!  It has a temperature dial for more/less heat.  It doesn't leave a ""crinkle"" in my hair like my last flat iron.  I love the storage pouch it comes with but I've never used the glove.  This iron doesn't leave my hair dry or frizzy.  I bought Garnier Fructis Style Sleek & Shine Flat Iron Perfector Straightening Spray to use with it and they go great together!  My hairstylist recommends washing hair at night, dry to 20% damp, straighten, sleep on it, touch up in the morning.  This advice was SO helpful for me with my long, thick, wavy hair.  Very happy I found this flat iron, and for a great deal too!  Thanks Amazon!",5
"I'm disappointed by this product and would advise those who are interested NOT to purchase.It does not run smoothly through your hair.  If you've used a good quality flat iron before, you know it doesn't snag your hair.I was busy and didn't get a chance to go through the return process early enough, and now it's in my storage closet waiting for our next yard sale.I went and purchased the CHI from my local CVS.  Previously, I've used a Sedu, which was purchased online at Folica.com.",1
"I originally purchased this iron several months ago.  At first I hated it and was ready to send it back after using it for two weeks.  However, as I kept using the product, I noticed my hair getting softer and straighter after every use.  I normally go to the salon for regular straightening every 3 to 4 weeks, but in this case, I have not been to the salon for over 6 months, and my hair still looks so soft and shiny!  There are a lot of reviews that they feel that the product ""does not heat up enough.""  I initially thought this too, but trust me, this is a GOOD thing!  You don't want to burn up your hair, like many others tend to think you have to have a super hot iron in order for it to work.  The iron I received has a little LED light that glows red when it's on, and then turns green when the product is heated to the temperature you set it on.  Throughout the styling process, you will notice that the led light will turn from green to red several times.  This is because it is maintaining the heating temperature.  Just keep this in mind when you do see it flicker from green to red.  The temperature is still set and you can still proceed with styling as usual.  With all of this being said, this is a great iron that gets your hair better with every use.  Do not get discouraged if you don't see immediate results!  Give this product a chance and you will love it!",5
Love this straightener! Also use it to curl my hair:) for the price I would recommend it to anyone!  Love the oil too,5
I like it.. But still love CHI brand better. The edges of this straightener catch on my hair so it's not as comfortable straightening my hair than it is with a CHI.,4
"I have thick wavy hair and I was looking to replace my old HAI flat iron that broke after many years if service. This flat iron claims to heat up above 400 degrees but my old iron seemed be be hotter at the same temp. Also this iron does not run through my hair as smoothly as my other one did. This iron does do a good job at making my hair stick straight so for the cost its a good deal.As far as the seller, I was very happy at the speed of delivery. I got it sooner than I expected!",3
"good quality and awesome price! its a really good deal!! it also has gloves and other things in the box , it is a good product!",5
I originally gave this product 4 stars only because I did not receive the trial size argan oil but soon after I wrote the review the seller contacted me and said that they would ship it out and they did. The flat irons are more than worth the price and the customer service was excellent!  I'm happy :-),5
Very unhappy to open it and find out it was missing the sample of argon oil which is why I picked this product to try in the first place.,2
"At first we were skeptical of ordering this product due to the great ratings and such a low price. It came really fast first of all. My wife was very pleased with how it tamed her very curly thick hair in only 1 to 2 swipes tops. It leaves her hair really silky and shiny without an oily residue. We are very pleased with the product and definitely recommend it to other people that may be skeptical of the price,in this case we got way more than we paid for. thumbs up",5
I am so happy with my HSI flat iron! My daughter has a CHI flat iron which we both use. I bought the HSI flat iron in case she's not here or hers brakes. I tried my HSI & couldn't believe the difference of how much better it was compared to her CHI flat iron. I had her try mine & she loves it. Her CHI is put away for now & we're both using the HSI. Also the Argan Oil is fantastic! I as so happy that I bought this product & I highly recommened it to anyone!,5
"I purchased one of these a couple of years ago, when it was on sale. I was in dire need of one, as I had been using a cheap Walmart-bought flat iron. I personally was not able to use the oil much, since my hair is already thin and becomes oily quick, but I could definitely see what others liked about it. As far as the flat iron itself, I really liked this one! It was much nicer than my cheapy one. It heated up quick and went through my frizzy hair perfect. Unfortunately, I end up using the flat iron quite often, but my hair always stay quite straight throughout the day with this one. Sadly, the plates in it started falling off just over a year after purchasing, and my search began for a new one (my hair was getting snagged in it constantly). I will say though, it was by far the best I'd used, and lasted longer than I expected.",4
I initially liked this product because I did a lot of research to find a cheap straightener that works good AND doesn't pull hair during use....and it this one followed through on those. Worked well for the price but plate cracked only after falling off sink one time....and then of course ripped hair out of our heads upon use due to the crack. Then it was dropped on floor again and the entire plate fell out and hangs on by wired only. So of course it had to be thrown out..and I only had it a few months :(,3
"I was previously using the coreliiss pro and after 7 years I dropped it and the plate broke. So when I went shopping for another I checked reviews and the hsi seemed like a no brainer.  But it's pretty basic, the plates do not spring as smooth so it pulls my hair a bit and the unit itself is a little bulky.  I wish I would have re purchased my coreliiss. It rocked, was light, super smooth to handle. Hsi doesn't suck but it's not great either.",3
"I stopped ""relaxing"" my hair several years ago in favor of my natural kinky-curl. This product gives me the option of straight hair that is just as silky-shiny and can hold a style every bit as well as chemically relaxed hair",5
"The HSI flat iron worked great for straightening my natural hair at very low heat. I love the fact that I could adjust the heat settings since my hair is really thin, I need the lowest temperature possible. However, when my sister uses the flat iron for her extensions, she is able to adjust the heat as high as needed to get the right curl. I took this flat iron to London and it worked just fine with a converter. Overall, good product with an even greater price tag.",5
This unit heats very quickly and leaves the hair very silky and smooth. I wear a full sew in weave and I love the heat adjustments. It also curls the hair . The enclosed bag makes it easy to pack when traveling especially if you are pressed for time. There is no need to let it cool before bagging and packing it. I highly recommend this unit!!!!!,5
"I bought this specifically for a trip to Italy. While it works both domestically and internationally, the straightening is just so-so. The plates don't glide through my hair like my conair does.",3
"I recently purchased the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron; and all I can say is,""my hair has been completely transformed!"" I have thin, fine, but frizzy hair, along with a steadily increasing number of greys.  I wash my hair every day just to give it some body. After washing, I use the HSI Argon Oil leave in treatment on damp hair (just a drop--AMAZING!).  Then I dry my hair and use the flat iron on a low setting; and in less than 5 minutes my hair has body, shine, with no evidence of frizz!  And after a few months, I have not noticed  any damage whatsoever.  I would highly recommend this combo...not only is the iron as good or better than CHI or any of the more  expensive irons, it is more reasonably priced.",5
"It works, but not a $199 iron - only worth $39.Wife had an expensive iron to compare this too.  She got this as was hoping that it would compare considering how the normal price is $199.  It doesn't.  There's no auto-shut-off feature.  The build quality is noticeably worse (but not terrible).  Also, her hair catches in it.  You get what you pay for.  Worth $39, but not more.",2
"I was really excited to receive this straightener since the reviews were fabulous.... Unfortunately I am not overly impressed.  I have owned many different flat irons, they all seem to work the same :( not sure why I expected more from this iron... I guess I was just hopeful. I have mediumThickness hair that is wavy ~ my hair still seems frizzy after I iron it.",3
"Got my straightener a few weeks ago. I have very thick curly hair that usually takes an hour (and another person) to straighten. I was pleasantly surprised that it got hot so fast and worked so well on my hair type without burning it. I'd recommend this product even for people who aren't great with hair (like me). Of the straighteners I've owned, this one has worked the best for me.",5
"Bought this as a replacement for my CHI because the CHI's plug broke :/Anyway, after reading the awesome reviews about this flat iron, I decided to get it. Plus it was on sale so I got it for a great deal. It works wonderfully. I have naturally curly hair (3B) and I blew it dry first, then used this iron and literally I was done. Super easy, and heats up fast.",5
THis was a good price so I ordered it based on the rave reviews I read. I was very disappointed in this straightener.It pulled my hair and did not easily glide up and down on my long hair. The results were not smooth. I would not recommend this to anyone.,3
"I was a little doubtful of this straightener at first, yet now that I have been using it I could not imagine ever living without it! This hair straightener is simply one of the BEST I've seen around. No more bad hair days for me!! This item deserves more than 5 stars! :)",5
"This is an update on my review. I have adjusted the heat on the flat iron, and the lower heat works good for me. My texture is curly and fine. I did not have to use the gloves and it still flat ironed my hair nicely. I now give this a 5 star rating. The key to soft hair is more argan oil with each use.",5
"I ended up returning this, which was disappointing. After reading all the rave reviews for it, I thought it might make a good replacement for my 6 year old chi straightener, which I love.Unfortunately, that was not the case. The HSI took a long time to heat up (I have long, thick hair) and then as soon as I would start straightening my hair, it would have to reheat up again. So straighten one piece of hair, wait for it to heat...and repeat. Not only that, but it didn't straighten my hair well at all. I would have to go over the same sections of hair 3-4 times. This was possibly related to the heating issue, but it was frustrating nonetheless.After a week of trying to use it, I gave up and went back to my old chi, which straightens my hair well in less than 10 minutes. One time I even used the HSI and then followed up with the chi.I suppose that my chi spoiled me; if I had been using a cheap straightener, this one would have seemed pretty great. However, since I'm used to a pretty nice straightener, this one was disappointing.",2
"I'd definitely recommend this straightener, especially to anyone with very thick, wavy hair. I decided to start growing my hair out again (currently it's about collarbone length), and I'd been using a crappy $20 straightener after my Sedu broke. My old straightener snagged my hair a TON, took a looong time, and wasn't going to cut it for longer hair. The HSI works great! I don't know if it's as great as my sedu was, so I gave it 4/5 stars purely for not being the best straightener I've ever used, but I like it a lot, and I think the price it right!",4
"This straightener retails for over $100 or you can buy direct through amazon and get it a great deal!!I bought this straightener because it had great reviews and I lost my old one. I do substantial research on products I intended to use for awhile because I don't want to be dissatisfied and have to buy another one spending more money. 95% of reviews are highly satisfied with this straightener and I am no different.I have fine, thin hair so it is easy to burn with hot tools. This straightener did not burn my hair at all!! No matter how many times I went over it to get it straight!!!It comes beaitufally packaged and they include a heat glove (which was MUCH APPRECIATED)and a trail size package of argan oil (which I am not addicted to).IF YOUR IN THE MARKET FOR A STRAIGHTENER, BUY THIS ONE FROM THIS SELLER AND YOU WILL KNOW YOU GOT A GREAT DEAL ON A GREAT PRODUCT",5
"The HSI straightener is a must have! It arrived a day ahead of schedule. The HSI straightener leaves your hair shiny and feeling silky smooth. The heat protection glove, cover to the straightener, and sample oil are an added bonus. Also, you are able to register the straightener for a one year warranty. I definitely recommend this product!",5
"HSI flat iron is more than I expected. As I age, my hair started to not only thin out, but became fine and frizzy. As a result, I had see through scalp with flat and frizzy hair. My main goal for making the purchase is to straighten the frizziness. However, it did much more than that. It styles my hair however I want it. I used it to add volume on top near the roots, straighten the mid section and finish by curling the ends. By doing this, my hair looks fuller, shiny and stylish. In short, I like this flat iron because, it ables me control the styles of my hair.",5
"She likes it. Had it a month now. Works as described, no complaints. Would buy again, especially for the $$$",4
"I've only had Chi's in the past. They were very expensive, but years ago, when they first came out, Chi was the Gold Standard. Fast forward several years and I'm thinking that the competition has had time to catch up. With the economy so bad, I decided to give this a try because it was considerably less expensive than the Chi. The reviews on Amazon were also so overwhelmingly positive, specifically in comparison to the Chi.I've only had this about 2 weeks. So far, I love it. This works even better than my old Chi. Another thing I like about it is I don't have to keep it on the highest setting and it works just fine. The lower heat has to be mean less damage to my hair. Some other reviewers say their product stopped working after about 3 months, so I'm still crossing my fingers. This also comes with an attractive case and a glove to avoid burns. Chi had no case or glove, so this was a pleasant surprise. It does require some maneuvering to slip it back into the case.",4
"As far as shipping, this item came in a day or so before i expected which was great. It heats up really quick too which I personally love. The only negative is that because I have thick wavy hair, it takes a couple tries before it's straight the way I like, even on a hotter setting. It may be because the metal plate is an inch versus my old one that was four or five. But overall im fairly satisfied with the product and it leaves my hair looking really shiny.",4
Not nearly as good as the Chi iron.  This one doesn't get as hot and feels a little rough on my hair.,3
I am very pleased with the HSI Professional flat iron.  It works as well as higher price flat irons.  I have been very pleased and would recommend to my friends.,5
"This is a very good flat iron.  I liked the fact that you can select temperature, however, I found that we have to have it turned to the hottest setting all the time.  Overall, I think it was a good value.",4
"Absolutely amazing! It's lightweight, it heats fast and is easy to use. I love it! It makes really nice curls as well!",5
"Until this craze with flat straight hair is over, I'm going to keep dragging mine out with HSI. The ceramic heating is so superior to the metal flat irons you get at Walmart or Target. if you have long hair, and you want to keep it in as best of shape as possible, you have to use a ceramic flat iron. You will stop getting dead frizzy fried ends. It also looks amazing.",5
"This flat iron is alright. I cannot rave about it and can't particularly hate it. Personally, I think it is very heavy and so it fatigues your arm especially if you have very thick, wavy/curly hair like mine. Even though its ceramic, and that is supposed to leave your hair nice and shiny and frizz free, I found that with my hair, it dries it out and have tons of frizz. I think this flat iron is great for those with thinner hair and more straight hair, but not very thick.",3
Its all been said before in the reviews. Heats up quickly and does a really good job. It arrived quickly and was as described except that there was no bottle of Agadir Argan oil but 2 sample sizes of the Agadir leave in product. Not a big issue.,5
"I took this straightener with me on a trip to Spain, and it worked perfectly with an adapter (to fit into the round-prong outlets). This was super helpful, given that my regular straightener didn't work, even with a converter. The straightener already knows what type of outlet it' being plugged into, so you don't need to adjust for 120V/220V. The sleeve that was included was helpful too, as I could tuck the straightener back into my suitcase without worrying about it burning anything. The only drawback is that the plates are a little small, so you can't get a big chunk of hair in one swoop.",4
"This flat iron is amazing.  I have been a Chi owner since 2007 and thought Chi was the best... even though 2 Chi's died on me.  I was also duped by those Mall Kiosk people and bought a Royale hair straightener... don't ever do that!!  They sold me a broken one and then when I tried to return it, they said they don't return items, only exchange.  The next one they gave me was awful also and broke in less than a year and I wasted $200!!!!  This time, I decided to take a chance and go with something new and I did NOT want to spend a lot of money again.  I was impressed by the reviews for the HSI so I decided to give this a shot.  This flat iron works just like the Chi, but probably better.  And it's so much more affordable.  It really really works well!!  If you want to save money and use a great flat iron, this is the one for you.",5
"When I am going to buy a product, I always make sure I do my research first. I keep careful and detailed accounts of the pros and cons of each specific product I look at, and I continue to refer to my lists until I have narrowed my choices down to what I believe to be the best products for the best value. In this case, the HSI Professional straightener won in each and every category I was researching. When the straightener came in the mail a few days after I ordered it, I was extremely excited to try it out. It came with a knit-glove, a silk carrying case, and a trial-sized bottle of argon oil - something I had never tried before, but soon fell in love with. I also was not disappointed when it came to the straightener itself. The conclusion I came to after my research rang true - this straightener worked even better than I was expecting. To be honest, I'd never used any kind of styling tool on my hair before, so I was a little nervous about using it for the first time, but those fears were unfounded. This tool could not be easier to use. It has a swivel cord, so it doesn't get tangled up with your hands as you're using it, which definitely cuts back on the time it takes to style your hair. The heat setting ranges from 140 degrees F to 400 degrees F, giving you control over how much heat you are applying to your hair and making this the perfect tool for all hair types. I have very long, very thick hair, so I generally turn the heat up all the way and can finish styling in about ten-fifteen minutes. You have every right to be impressed by that; I know I was. My hair has never looked better - it's controlled, it's smooth, it's silky...I had been thinking about just chopping my hair off because of how unmanageable it had become, but thanks to my HSI I no longer have to. The plates are ceramic and do not extend, something I personally prefer, because I feel it makes it easier to style your hair when the plates don't slide up and down as you're working. I'm also impressed by how cool the tool stays - the handle doesn't get hot at all. I use the glove provided on the hand that's going to touch my hair, because for the first couple minutes after running the straighter through, your hair will maintain the temperature of the plates.I can honestly give this product five stars. My hair and I have no complaints.",5
It heats fast and overall the best flat iron I have own. It leaves hair soft too. It works great.,5
"The straightener gets hot fast, but it doesn't work well with de-frizzing hair. Overall, a good product but there are definitely better out there! But good bang for the buck.",3
I'm black so I have super thick kinky hair and it's really hard to find flatirons that will completely straiten my hair but these... OMG..! Perfect. I just wish they had an auto shut off. I keep leaving them on.,5
"This is probably the best flat iron that I have ever used. I get better result than when I go to the hair salon, so I go even less and save money.  I would definitely recommend this product.",5
This is a great price and a great product.  I was replacing my 5 year old Chi that finally broke (the switch went out and I had it repaired but it didn't last long)  The HSI flat iron straightens just as well as the Chi at a fraction of the cost.  My only complaint is that it's heavier than the Chi but nothing I can't deal with.  The product was delivered quickly and just as advertised.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MA0QY2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,4
"I am flabbergasted at the fact that this is so highly rated. I have to wait about 10 mins for it to get to the full temperature setting. It says it gets up to 410 degrees and that's a huge lie. It says you can curl your hair with it.... Um if ud like to set the world record for loosest curls. I straightened my hair with it and it felt like the longer I used it the cooler the flat iron got. Like it couldn't take being used for 20 minutes. I rated it 2 stars because it does, to some degree, straighten your hair. You just need patience. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT THOUGH! it's a waste of your money. Oh and don't buy any of the Chi's on Amazon neither they're all fake!! To be honest I feel like this flat iron is probably fake too.",2
"Absolutely love this iron. Barely have to use any product to straighten my hair. Whats better, if i pull my hair up into a ponytail when i take it down there is no crease from the ponytail. Just smooth hair.",5
I didn't pay very much for this product but had I paid what it was listed for I wouldn't have been very happy.  Product works fine but does not work any better or any worse than my other flat iron that I only paid $25.00 for.  The heat adjustment knob seems a little cheap and wobbly.,3
"Shipper was great, there was a missing product and they replaced it right away.This won't replace my other straightener that works great, but that was also more expensive. For the price i paid for it, this works okay for traveling and as a back-up.",3
I am African American with really thick hair the HSI ceramic tourmaline flat iron did a wonderful job. I will be purchasing two more flat irons in the near future for my two daughters.,5
I have used this flat iron twice and I liked the way it styled my hair. Very easy to use. It heats up quick and I am able to flatten my hair in less than 10 mins. It did not damage my hair unlike other heat products. Could have been perfect if it had a lock and digital display of temperature. I gave 4 becoz I did receive Argan oil of small one use sachet just :( otherwise it great buy!,4
"I received this product when promised, which I thank the seller for :). I am in love with my new flatiron, I have had many brands but this one tops them all!  I have naturally curly hair so I am using this thing all the time but each time I use it it, it does what it's supposed to and very well!  Try it you will love it too :)",5
I've bought a lot of flat irons and paid 4x what this one costs but this one is the best without question.,5
This is an exceptional product and very easy to use.  The adjustable temperature control is strategically placed to avoid accidental changing.  The iron feels great in your hand makes it easy to reach the back of your head.  I especially like the slight curve which allows for both over and under flips as well as straightening.  I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.,5
"As a mother of three teenage girls, we've tried em all... Hands down this is our favorite. We actually ordered two more because we are afraid of not being able to find em if something happens to the one we have!",5
I bought this for travel to Europe and it has been doing its job! I am very pleased with it so far.,5
"I have been wanting a Chi straightener but haven't wanted to spend that much, I gave in a bought this one. Love it! Really like where the controls are, you don't have to always check to see if you have turned it off because you accidentally touched it with you fingers. My grand-daughter used it and she said she like it better than her moms Chi....made me very happy!",5
"This is the 2nd HSI Flat Iron I have bought for my Daughter!  She dropped and cracked the plate on her first one, had it almost 2 years was still working great!!  So when I went to buy a replacement I was soo happy to find another HSI Iron.  SHe has curly hair and hates it so I was buying a new iron every year till we bought her first HSI.  Only brand I will buy for her now!",5
I've had a CHI for five years and wanted to try a different flat iron. Well this one is PERFECT. I highly recommend this product.,5
"Heats up quickly, very fast shipping and the glove comes in very handy. I will probably buy one more for our guest bath.",5
I am very pleased with the flat iron.  It works just as well as my old one but at a fraction of the price.  I would recommend it to anyone considering a purchase.,5
"Love the hair straightener. Heats up fast, recovers fast from heat loss while styling. Nicely packaged with travel case and bonus oil pack for hair.",5
"I was excited to get a new flat iron hoping it would do a better job than my previous one.  This one works ok...it doesn't seem to get hot enough and the light, once green, keeps going back to red - I'm not sure what its doing but it seems that it takes forever to flat iron my short, fine hair.  It is easy to hold though, and it does glide nicely on my hair.",3
"I purchased this flat iron and LOVED it. I have curly thick hair. I had never straightened my hair by myself before. And it worked perfectly! Of course I did a blowout beforehand to style it well (I'm a perfectionist). I used the argan oil that comes with it and I have to say it is great too. It took me a long long time to finish my hair but I think as I do it more often I'll be able to do the whole process faster. The pouchy bag that comes with it is great as well as the glove. Let me take an extra minute and talk about the glove. GENIOUS idea. I was able to use the flat iron over and over in the same section of hair and not burn my fingers because of the glove. Use the flat iron with your right hand and put the glove in the left one (the other way if you're a lefty).Overall, I couldn't be happier with the price (the cheapest offered on Amazon) and the quality of the product.",5
Didn't know what to expect when flat irons are typically so much more expensive. This one has clear instructions and takes the frizz out as promised. Very satisfied with ease of use and great results.,5
Daughter loves how nice this flat iron works.Heats up quickly and works to straightenhair easily.  Would recommend this sightand product to others.,5
"In short, I'm very happy with my purchase of the HSI Flat Iron.I ordered the flat iron at a very reasonable price (~$40), and I'm pleased with the quality of product I received for the money.  The flat iron arrived brand new in box, very well packaged.  Included in the box was the iron, a carrying pouch, a small sample of HSI Argan Oil (which is amazing), and a heat glove.The iron heats up very quickly.  It has a nice weight behind the plates, which close tightly on your hair.  With previous irons, I've had to press down on the plates.  Not so with this iron.  The outside of the iron does get pretty warm, but not enough to put on the heat glove.  The iron glides pretty easily through you hair, more so if you use a styling product (oil, flat iron spray, etc.).  You do need to iron small sections of hair - you can't be lazy and try to flat iron a large section at once.  Small sections, with a single pass, and you're good.  The curved edges of the iron make it easy to flip ends out or in, giving you more body and shape.I would say this iron works just as well as a Chi or other expensive ceramic iron.  It's definitely better than Conair or other brands you can find at your local retail store.",5
"Super Fast Shipping!!!! Don't be fooled into thinking that spending more money on something means it's a superior product!' This is the best flat iron EVER!!' Took a risk for $40 and I have been blown away!!. FYI-my AA hair is thick, long, very curly, & frizzy.",5
THIS IS THE BEST IRON I HAVE EVER USED AND I HAVE OWNED MANY DIFFERENT ONES! I LOVE HOW IT GETS REALLY HOT AND GLIDES THROUGH YOUR HAIR! COMES W/ A COOL GLOVE SO YOU DONT BURN YOUR OTHER HAND! AND ALSO COMES W/ A CARRY POUCH! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!,5
I recently purchased this flat iron and received it much quicker that expected.  I had previously used a Remington flat iron and was so glad when it quit working so I could get a new one because it pulled my hair out every time I used it when my hair would get caught on the edge of the plates.  This does not happen with the HSI.  It has been such a relief using this flat iron and not having to worry about my hair getting pulled.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.,5
"I have very thick hair and this does not get hot enough to straighten my hair, I used it 2xs and gave it away",2
"My wife has never used a flat iron before this purchase.  This iron is very easy to use and it comes with a glove so if you need to use two hands, you won't burn the other hand. The oil that is included is a leave in oil and does not leave your hair oily so you can use the iron immediately.  She says this iron is as nice as the CHI (which was used on her at her salon)and less expensive.  She highly recommends this product.",5
I've had this straightener for two years now and it still works wonders! I have curly hair that is kind of difficult to straighten but this does the job effortlessly and beautifully. I don't think I've ever spent more than 10 minutes on my hair. Perfect! I'm so happy to have found it!!,5
"I am very happy with this flat iron. It gets my wiry, bushy hair smooth, and it does it quickly. I keep thinking I will use a straightening treatment, especially in  the summer, but then I use my flatiron and think, why bother? Really does the job!,",5
"I did not know what to expect when I ordered this, but I have naturally wavy hair that just does not do what I want it to do!  The iron works beautifully to shape my hair the way I want it to go, and the effect seems to last.  Perfect.  Plus - Service from the seller, Blue Novelties, was perfect.  It arrived sooner than I had expected, in perfect condition.  I can't give it 5 stars because I have very little to compare it to.....",4
"Purchased this for occasional use.  I was heading into a humid climate and didn't want to end up looking like a frizz ball.  Product performed to expectations and did exactly what I wanted it to do.  It's very professional looking and comes packaged nicely.  It's a good value for the price since equally rated items were priced higher.  It has variable temperatures which was important to me since I have fine hair and didn't want it overheated. I didn't use the Argan oil but might in the future.  This was my second shipment though because the first order shipped with the free Argan sample inadvertently open in the box, saturating the cloth holder.  The company instantly replaced it and the second unit came complete and well packaged.  I would write more about usage but I haven't used it that often so I can't rate it for durability, however I would recommend this to someone looking for this type of flat iron.",5
I just wished it would have a higher heat setting. The packaging is nice and I like the heat bag. I'd recommend this product if you need something to take you in between times from salon visits.,3
"The only hair straighteners I've had before this were the 20$ ones from Target. This one is AMAZING. Stays super hot, and still works great - I've had it for a year and a half-ish and it still works amazing. Granted, my hair is a short layered bob with a super stacked back, but I use it pretty much every other day and it still works like a charm. I can straighten my super think and wavy hair in 10 minutes flat.",5
"I was so impressed with this flat iron. I was skeptical because the price was so low but the tool is great. It heats up quickly and straightens my hair out with no hesitation. My hair is thick and curly, kind of rebellious in some spots, but the flat iron took care of that. My hair looks shiny, too. I am definelty going to purchase one for my sister. Buy it. You wont be disappointed. Everything that is promised is fulfilled.",5
We needed this for a trip to Europe because of the voltage requirements there. This iron worked perfectly. My wife and daughter shared the iron on our trip and both were very happy with how it worked.,5
"Excellent product, especially for the price! I have it set at a fairly low temperature and I still only have to run it through my hair once for a perfectly smooth look and my hair is fairly thick! If I want to turn the ends under, I am able to use this tool to do that, too! I also LOVE the oil that came with it! What a fabulous bonus! I highly recommend this product!",5
I purchased this product initially for it's dual voltage feature which I needed for my trip to Europe.  I was not expecting to like it as well as my expensive straight iron that I have used for a couple years.  I was pleasantly surprised to find I like it better!  I have continued to use it even after returning home.  It is easy to hold and does a better job at smoothing my hair out.  My sister-in-law used it on our trip and loved it as well.  Would definitely recommend to anyone for travel or home use.,5
"Used in Europe, worked well with power source.  No problems.  Have fine hair so I used a low heat setting at around 325-350 degrees.  Left hair shiny.",4
My CHI burned out after about 2 years of use (everyone in my sorority used it to get ready). Instead of spending another $200 on a CHI I decided to go with the HSI and I couldn't be happier. It gets plenty hot and straightens my hair extremely fast with little damage. I would recommend and have recommended this product to mutiple people.,5
"I live where it's very hot and often humid. I find many flat irons do a poor job under these conditions except this one! It quickly flattens my hair even on the most humid days even in a humid hot bathroom. It heats up quickly and I love that I don't have to wait. It comes with some nice extras like cute carrying case, hand mitt, hair oil and extra length to the cord. I like the extra long cord because when I travel the plug isn't always so close to a convenient mirror so the long cord helps me out. Nice product. I'd definitely recommend it and buy it again. Great price for the value.",5
"It does not due what I expected from a flat iron.  I had previously owned a Ceramics straightener and thought this one would be the same, if not better, for the way it was advertised.  I have relatively straight hair and use a flat iron for touch ups, but it leaves my hair frizzy, where as no other flat iron had before.",1
"I have coarse hair and needed a good straightener!  I had just gotten a ghd straightener for Xmas, recommended by my stylist.  It worked really good, and my daughter was always ""borrowing"" it.  So I decided to get her one for her birthday, and after reading the reviews I bought this HSI straightener. And it was half the price.  I tried this the other day instead of my own, and it is amazing!  It makes my hair feel softer and straighter than the ghd straightener.  It DOES take longer to heat up, and it doesn't have a beep when it's ready, but it does work very well.  It also does REALLY NICE CURLS that I didn't realize when I bought it.  VERY COOL GIFT FOR A REASONABLE PRICE!!!",5
This does a great job on my hair. It doesn't take long to get my hair straight with this product and my hair never feels dry after using it.,5
"For this money it should not break this soon...  no warranty, no money or replacement.  Im going to get three cheap ones for the same price.",1
"After my old flat iron died, I dreaded trying to find a new one.  I decided to take a gamble on the HSI Professional flat iron, and boy, did it pay off!  This is by far the best flat iron I've ever had.  It's at least as good as, if not better, than the one my hairdresser uses.  I actually enjoy using it, which has never been the case before.Thanks for carrying such a good product at such a reasonable price.",5
I have only used this a couple of times but its been great!  I have very thick hair and can never straighten my hair well. This thing works like magic. I even used it after a day in a ponytail and my hair was straight and smooth. Awesome!,5
I received this straightener shortly after ordering and I am very pleased with it so far! The wide range of temperature settings works well for all hair types and does its job the first time!,5
"I love the adjustable temperature setting and the slim body. The glove is quite useful, too.  I recommend this product.",5
"TOOK ON A TRIP, WORKED GREAT ON THE FRIZZ EVEN THOUGH IT IS SMALLER THAN WHAT I NORMALLY USE.  GLAD I PURCHASED IT",5
"I have bought other flat irons before and given them away, but this one is so great!  Thank you so very much!",5
"got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She uses it daily. Her hair always looks amazing, I assume she is happy with it and would recommend",5
I mostly love my new hair straightener.  I would give 5 stars however I am not very experienced with other brands of hair straighteners.  I also wish it was slightly more wide.  The absolute best feature about it would be that it doesn't get hot to the touch.  My friend's straightener will literally burn her or whoever if it is touched.  I can put this on the highest setting and it is nowhere near that bad.  I love the sample HSI serum that was included with it.  Freebies are always nice.  I think the glove is alright but I do not usually use it.  The pouch is nice and soft to keep it in.  It makes my hair straight however I do have to run it over the strand a couple of times.  My hair stylist does not feel it should be set on the absolute highest setting 410 degrees so I keep it was 375 or so.  I wish it would straighten more without multiple swipes.  I have pretty straight hair already compared to others so that should be noted.  Overall its a good product but as I said I am not sure if there are better options.  I would recommend buying it if you are looking for affordability.  For the price I think the straightener is fabulous.,4
"I would like to start off saying i have coarse, frizzy hair and have used many different brands of flat irons over the last 15 years. I received this flat iron for Christmas last year. At first I was impressed with how quickly it heated, but found that I still needed to make multiple passes to ensure my hair was straight and frizz free. Over all, this flat iron is good for the price, but I would recommend spending the extra to purchase a Paul Brown Hawaii flat iron instead.",3
"The flat iron worked just as it stated. My grandchild has very tight coily curly hair. Other flat irons typically left her hair dry and fried look without completely straightening her hair. HSI left her smooth, silky, straight and bouncy. it did not burn her hair or leave that burnt smell. I also have curly wavy hair but not as tight as her's and loved the way HSI left my hair. I did not have to repeat several times to straighten a section of hair. I used the highest setting on both of our hair and it did not burn or dry the hair out. I highly recommend this product, especially for the price!!",5
"I purchased one for a friend when her flat iron gave out, then I purchased one for myself after she said how much she liked it.  Seller sent package very quickly.  No problems.",5
"I have been looking for a great flat iron for months. After trying a few other brands, I really wasn't satisfied. Then, a friend told me to try HSI. I ordered it and love it. It glides smoothly down my hair and doesn't rip it out. Also, it has rounded edges and a heat setting, which is great for all hair types. The HSI PROFESSIONAL CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON is a great product! As a bonus, I also received a hot iron glove, carrying pouch and Argan oil!",5
I had to return this product b/c I set the head for 400 and I could still touch it after 5 min of heating up. it never got very hot. Maybe I had a bad one but I just went with a baby bliss (which is a lot of money but has a 4 year warrenty) and it works amazing!,1
I bought this as a gift for my fiance over Christmas and she loved it.  She says that the Ceramic in this model was much superior than many of the other brands that she has bought and it works great on her hair.,5
"I am extremely pleased with this straightener. I am an African American woman with thick, curly hair, and before purchasing this product, I had difficulties getting my hair completely straight.Since purchasing this straightener about a year ago, I have stopped going to salons because I've been getting professional results. I am constantly getting compliments on how healthy and smooth my hair looks. Additionally, I have tried this product on relatives with similar thick, coarse hair. This product gets hair bone straight and I've found that it works for creating all types of hairstyles.I recommend this straightener to everyone because it seriously works. Also, contrary to what some of these reviews state, i've found that this straightener gets VERY hot if you take time to learn how to properly turn up the heat.I usually do not write such long, in depth reviews, but I am very satisfied with this product and the silky-smooth effect it has on my hair-in addition to the affordable price. This product earns 5 stars, for sure. Buy it, I promise you won't regret it!",5
I ordered this product after reading reviews and comparing prices. Item arrived on time and packed well. The flat iron is a good one. I especially like that you can set the temperature. The protective bag is also nice and thick.,5
"This straightener works very well, especially for the price I purchased it for on Amazon. I have thin hair and do not need to use the highest temperature for it to straighten my hair quickly.",5
"I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly hair. This flat iron works great on my hair! I got it because it was a great price and had so many good reviews-highly recommend this flat iron.",5
"I was excited to get this product since it had so many great reviews. It worked really well and my hair was nice and straight. Normally I don't use my straightener that much- maybe on average once every two weeks, so I was extremely surprised to see my straighter glitch and not maintain its heat even at the highest level. The light indicator would flash from red to green, then instantly flash to red again. The iron will be hot one second, then warm the next, so it causes chaos to my hair and I'll have to re-straighten strands. I wouldn't recommend this product.",1
"So far so good. I can believe how straight my hair gets with this flat. I have medium length hair that is thick, and let me tell you this get my hair nice and straight and smooth. Best part dont have to go over a section 3x like my other. Also it heats up super fast I was amaze. This my friend is a great buy and price, please dont keep searching just purchase this iron right away. =)",5
Used on med-thick slightly wavy hair. Leaves hair very smooth and silky. Would highly recommend this and have done so to many friends!,5
"Love this flat iron. Love the temperature control, and that it allows the flat iron to heat evenly. I have relaxed hair, and got a new hair cut that requires some flat ironing. It was very important for me to get one at a great price, that will heat evenly, and not burn my hair. After reading some reviews, I decided to give this one a try, and it is simply amazing. My daughter has natural hair (no relaxers), and loves it also. I have to keep going to her room each time I need it, because she uses it all the time. I am having a little bit of an issue not turning the gauge while doing my hair, but I know that it I will get pass that soon. I am planning to surprise my daughter with one for her birthday in a few months. Great buy at a wonderful price!!",5
This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used. One pass over the hair and it's straight and shinny. I highly recommend this product.,5
Great product.used to have a chi and this works just as good as the chi. Heats up fast.haven't had any issues so far.,5
"Ordering this product started out a little challenging because somehow it got lost in the mail. When I didn't receive it I emailed Amazon Customer service. OMG!!! I got an immediate response assuring me they were checking into the problem and in the meantime they had immediately refunded my money. The following day I received another email saying the item had been returned and if I wished to reorder they would pay for one day shipping. I must admit I wasn't going to reorder but because of promptness with which they handled the problem, I reordered and received it in one day as promised. I used it on my daughters hair who is African American and has very thick and long hair. WOW!!!! we were shocked at how well it straightened her hair and it had bounce and body like crazy. The compliments she received where overwhelming! Everyone thought she had a relaxer. I have been spreading the word about this awesome product. Thanks again Amazon for the great customer service! I must also mention a great thanks to the seller. They also contacted me right away to let me know they were working on the problem. I am very appreciative for their great customer service as well.",5
"I was a bit skeptical about buying this from the 2 and 1 star reviews but I'm glad I pushed that aside.  I am extremely happy that I bought this because it is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  I usually buy irons bigger than this 1 inch iron but it works so much better!!  It heats up fast, and after using it for the first time today, I can say that my hair looks as straight as it did when I last put relaxer in.  I usually use ""One and Only"" argon oil, so I haven't tried the HSI oil just yet.  The glove is great for controlling the iron and protecting your hand in the process, which aids in getting even better results with your hair.  The only thing is the indicator light kept flickering from green to red during use.  I'm not sure if that was supposed to happen.  Other than that it is an excellent product, a great buy at $39.99, and I will recommend this to everyone.  Ignore the low ratings, IT IS PERFECT!!",5
"I broke my old Hai Classic flat iron and since it was discontinued and all the remaining stock went up in price, I decided to buy something less expensive.  I had high hopes for this item but ended up being disappointed.  The two flat iron plates were not perfectly aligned.  One end of the plates touched first and consequently pulled my hair every time I ran it down a hair section.  Ouch!  I'll be returning this item and will try to hunt down another Hai Classic flat iron.",1
"My hair straightener that I've had for over 6 years died on me in the middle of straightening my hair. So in a panic I went online to find out what kind of straighteners were out there. I googled top flat irons of 2013 and the HSI by CHI came up on top. The site directed me to Amazon where I saw an insane amount of excellent reviews. And then I checked out the price was completely blown away! I was expecting to pay well over $150 for a new flat iron and this was only $39.99!! Seemed a little too good to be true. I went ahead and did the overnight shipping which was actually not bad at all. I received the package the next day as expected, which was awesome because I had no working flat iron!My previous flat iron was J-Beverly Hills, and mine was some type of metal. This HSI is a ceramic Tourmaline. It was definitely a different feel than my other one, it didn't seem like I was yanking some strand when I was straightening, it seemed like a smoother motion. I do however, feel like I need to go over the pieces a little more than with my other, it doesn't get my hair as straight. But I do find that my hair feels softer somehow. I must note that I have really thick, wavy (sometimes pretty curly) hair. So it usually takes me quite a while to straighten it.All-in-all, its a pretty nice flat iron. I like the red silk carrying case and the free sample bottle of oil that came with it. I do however need to look up how to use that oil, lol. I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone at this $39.99 price. I would probably not pay the retail price of $200.",4
I absolutely LOVE this flat iron!!!  It makes my hair so soft and smooth.  Definitely the best flat iron I have ever received.  Would highly recommend it to anyone with thick hair like mine.,5
GREAT. WORKS WONDERS ON CURLY HAIR IN HUMID CONDITIONS AND STAYS FOR SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT DAMAGING HAIR SINCE HAS CONTROLS,4
I have ordered two of this product.  I ordered the first one & LOVED it so I ordered another one for my daughter.  The shipping was incredible...the product is incredible and it was overall a great experience! !,5
"Hands down, the best straighter I ever purchased. Heats up fast and makes my hair feel and look fabulous. Enough said, the price is fantastic JUST BUY IT already.....cheaper then the CHI and they all do the same thing!",5
"This iron will not heat up to 450, which in my case is ok because my hair is really fine and will burn, but if you have thick or curly hair, forget it, it will never straighten your hair. This iron is ok, but I will not purchase it again. I noticed something funny though, I recently purchased another iron ""Le Angelique"" and BOTH have the same design, same controls, same body...everything is the same, even the ""made in china"" sticker. The only difference was the name tag on each of them and that one has black plates and the other one tan, this one say HSI and the other TA. Am affraid some manufacturers are using the SAME irons but adding their own name on them. Good luck",3
I love this flat iron! I have very thick and curly hair but it straightens my hair with no problem. It also leaves my hair very shiny and soft. It was an added joy to purchase it in sale. Thanks!!,5
"I've only had a chance to use it a few times since I received it less than a week ago. It heats up fast and plates line up nicely. I like that it is dual voltage. I use it to curl my hair, not straighten. The delivery time was very good. I only gave it 4 stars because it hasn't passed the test of time yet.",4
used the product and it worked great. i loved the end results. I will def continue to use this product and try other products from this brand.,4
"As an African-American female, I have purchased quite a few flat irons for my family. Some have cost a lot of money and did well with heating and straightening/curling, but then the apparatus would come apart or flake or ""melt"". Some did a good job of straightening/curling, if it did not actually fry your hair off. The plates are coated well enough so that you do not hear your hair being singed, even at the highest setting.  Heats quickly too. I also believe this one is constructed better. It is not super-light, but durable. It heats well, but I feel like my hair (and my hands) are protected. I have not yet used the glove or the argan oil. I would love to purchase a 1/2-inch one, if they had it. Good price!",5
"Like most other reviewers here, I used a Chi Turbo for three years until it died on me. When I discovered the cost of repairs would be more than I paid for the actual iron, I decided to just buy a new one. This iron is just as good, if not better, than my Chi. It gets just as hot, just as fast. I've been using it for a few months, now, and I am pretty satisfied. I have ethnic hair, and it's really good for straightening my roots in between relaxers, but be forewarned that, if it's humid outside, you'll need to put something in your hair to make sure that it doesn't puff up again.There are only two cons I can think of. (1) The barrel gets REALLY hot, and it's easy to burn yourself with it. I was used to being able to hold the edge of my Chi iron's barrel while curling my hangs, but you absolutely cannot do that with this iron, you will burn yourself. Also, be careful about burning your forehead as well. (2) There's no auto-shutoff, and I would suggest spending the extra $10 for the LCD display iron with the auto-shutoff option. At least twice now I've left my iron on overnight or for a whole day (I had to make myself a big note and tape it to the bathroom mirror!). If you're forgetful like me, it;'s worth it to get the LCD iron.",4
"So I was in need of a flat iron and read many reviews.  I really didn't want to pay a ton of money and heard about a lot of knock offs of the big seller that everyone uses which made me leary.  My daughter and daughter in law have the very expensive one and swear by it.  After reading the reviews for the HSI professional flat iron, I thought what the heck.  I've only had it for a week but I ABSOLUTELY love it.  It heats up really quickly, my hair does not tangle up in it and I haven't had any problems with it what so ever.  I showed it to my daughter and let her try it and she was impressed by it as well.  Then when I told her the price she didn't even believe me.  She said it had to be way more expensive because of the quality of it. I assured her it wasn't and we both agreed it was well worth the price paid.  I am so glad I took the chance and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality flat iron.  Thanks HSI and Amazon!!",5
"Background: I have a really old chi from back when they were the best out there.  It is scratched so I wanted a new one.  Unfortunately many people including a couple stylists told me chi has not been as good lately so I tried something different.  I didn't want to pay a lot so alas I bought the HSI.Product Performance: Nothing special.  It gets hot, but not as hot as my chi.  I have really curly hair so I had to go over it a few time. Regardless I ended up with straight hair eventually.  A super plus is the oil it comes with!  It made my hair so soft and shiny.  I will definitely invest more into that stuff.  I didn't have the hair pulling problem like some people.  Maybe that is a technique thing.  One major downfall for me personally is that the straightener doesn't open very far which hinders my control a little and I can't hang it on the towel bar I hung my other one on.  That is why I went with 3 stars.",3
"I ordered this item for my sister to take it with herself to Europe on her trip. although I could get it for free, I paid extra shipping expenses to be sure that it arrives on time, I got the iron one day before her trip, I just opened it to look at the iron, but as soon as I moved it, I noticed that there is a broken or extra piece inside, when I shake the iron I could hear a sound like a screw inside iron. I turned it on and the light turned green, but I couldn't send it back because of time constrain. I was embarrassed in front of my sister, I hope that it works and that broken piece does not make problem.I had bought similar iron last year for myself from store and it works very well, so I would say good item but bad shipper!!",2
I was very disappointed in this flat iron! After reading all the reviews I thought it would be a good choice but it wasn't. My hair was curly I tried straightened it and it would not make it straight (even with the control all the way up). I gave it a try for almost a month and the results were very poor. I returned it and going to try the chi or amika.,2
Fast shipment. Leaves my hair nice and bone straight. I can't believe they're coming up with better flat iron now a days and for lesser prices. I'm very impressed with this product. Love!,5
"Love my new straightener. Had a Chi for about 5 years now , no problems with it , but wanted to try something new. So far, so good  This HSI was less than half of what I paid for my chi. Heats up super fast and handles well. Hair is de frizzed in no time. I have the digital model ,my one complaint is the digital read is on the inside of the straightener. Hard to get at the buttons with my big hands.",4
"This is a great flat iron ever. I have frizzy hair and it always bothers me. The flat iron is hot enough on the ceramic plate to make my frizzy hair totally straight and SHINY, and will not burn you on the outside when touched your skin. I'll recommend this to whom has frizzy hair.",5
"This product worked great.  Best flat iron I have ever purchased, and for such a great price! I would recommend this product.",4
"*This was a 5 star review from my first week*: This straightener works well, a little less heat then my previous one, but at least it doesnt pull out myhair! Was nice that the seller included a bottle of oil for my hair.**UPDATE***So, I had a Ionika before I purchased this one. I owned it for 3 years! So, it was time to get another. (Note: I straighten my hair EVERY DAY, at night with a Remington Wet - Straight and then in the morning with a ceramic to get the fly away's... so it it's used) I read my reviews, was going to go for the same but as I am a religious Amazon-er I figured I couldn't go wrong with this so I ordered...It was great the fist week, then I noticed my hair getting stuck in the sides where the plates attach.The biggest problem is that 8 months of using it and one day it literally blows up while I'm using it! It popped and sparked as I was doing my hair! I quickly unplugged it and let my husband inspect it. He noticed the cord where it swivels was open and the wires were visible. Now I understand that you can not wrap the cord as this causes wear, I use it and then store it in a drawer.It was unbelievable to me as to how I could own one for 3 years (using and storing it the same way) and then this just break down in less than a year. I am VERY UNHAPPY.I think I will go for the Remington, as I have been using the Wet - Straight for 4 years now.",1
My new fav!! My hair is very thick & it gets my hair bone straight in no time..Very nice packaging comes in a cute little satin bag and comes with a glove.. You won't be disappointed if u buy this product:),5
I use this product daily to deliver the straightest hair possible. I like that it doesn't burn my hair.  I also use it for my daughter's hair.,5
"This straightener is as good as the Chi I used to own, but it isn't the same so it's difficult to compare the two. I'll do my best though.I purchased the HSI Professional 1 1/4"" flat iron, just to make sure you don't think I'm talking about the 1"". (There are differences.)HSI Pros: Price. Has an on and off switch, auto-shutoff timer, temperature control, goes up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Heats up quickly and lets you know when it's ready with a light. Straightens quickly and my hair looks great when I'm done. I think the results often look better than the Chi's results.Chi Pros: Has an on and off switch, heats up quickly, ALWAYS slides smoothly over hair, straightens quickly and hair looks great when done. Simple to control- I don't really need or use an automatic shut-off or temperature control and so this is perfect for me. The Chi has floating, or movable plates. When you squeeze the iron shut, the plates move to fit perfectly to each other or your hair. I think this is what gets rid of the slight friction I feel with the HSI. Very consistent results.HSI Cons:  All the buttons and controls are a bit overkill, IMO, I don't need temperature control, a 450 degree iron straightens in less passes than a 350 degree iron which makes the damage amount hard to compare. The HSI sometimes pulls my fine hair a little bit if I don't try to straighten enough hair. This pulling isn't really painful, nor does it pull or break any hair, but it's not really pleasant either. Plates aren't floating like Chi's.Chi Cons:  Price. While I don't really care about this feature, it would be nice if Chi would add an automatic shut-off.Overall, I recommend both equally. If you can afford the Chi and don't need or want all the bells and whistles, go for it. If you are a person who needs the automatic shut-off, go for the HSI.",4
"When reviewing the reviews, I expected way more out of this flat iron.  It's OK and works fine but I was hoping it would have gotten hotter.  I do have thicker hair that is curly so it's a little harder to get my hair straight.  I will keep it because it does work fine but had bigger expectations.",4
"I bought this flat iron after misplacing a different off brand one. I was pleasantly surprised with this styling tool! I have ethnic hair and while my hair is healthy, its also extremely thick (even my hair stylist comments on this all the time). I hate pressing my own hair and will procrastinate as long as I can before doing it. It normally takes me such a long time to get it straight, but with this straightener, I literally cut that time in half. I especially like the sample Argon Oil that was included with this. It smells amazing and made my hair shiny without being heavy. I bought this based on the great reviews given by others, and I have to say this iron is a winner! You really can't beat the amazing price that its selling on Amazon. Thanks for saving me time, HSI :-)",5
I received my flat iron about five days after I ordered and I am in LOVE with it! This flat iron is so awesome. It heats up quickly and I'm done with my hair in half the time that it took with my old one. I would recommend this product to anyone.,5
"great price for the quality, had a pyt but dropped it so many times it over heats and i needed something new and this what i anybody needs . i have thick curly hair and it goes straight and full of body",5
"I was a little concerned about buying a straightening iron over the internet because of the high volume of counterfeits sold through a second party (like Amazon). So, the first thing I did was register my product via the manufacturer's website - no issues, it is indeed an HSI! There were a few issues with shipping: The first one I ordered never arrived, however, the seller (Blue Novelties) contacted ME to make sure everything went smoothly and shipped a replacement via priority mail. Would happpily do business with Blue Novelties again. I appreciated their attention and I recieved a genuine product for a reasonable price.The product itself does exactly what it advertizes - heats up quickly, makes my hair sleek and shiny and, after several weeks, doesnt seem to be exascerbating the damage done to my hair by other devices. It's rather easy to use and lightweight. I am very pleased all around - both with the product and the seller. Highly recommended.",5
"It`s amazing how it works, it really is professional... I used to flatten my hair in like 20 minutes or more... now in 5 minutes I`m ready to go!! There`s no doubt its money well spent. 100% recomendable :)",5
"So let me start by saying im cheap. I tend to go for the best deal and tend to always get what i pay for so to speak. Not this time, i did a TON of research and looked over hundreds of reviews. I was more than willing, for the first time, to invest in some serious cash and didnt have to! I also bought the argon oil in advance, as well as a hsi hair dryer. My hair was dry, straightened and silky smooth in 20 min!!! I have thick red hair so my hair takes alot of work to get it where i want it, but not anymore! Also, im not much into reviews but i felt i HAD to let everyone know how AMAZING this product is!!! Hopefully my review can help convince someone to purchase this wonderful product!!! Also purchased through amazon, and my whole package got here a day early! Cant beat that!!!",5
"I have been searching for this flat iron for about a decade! I have very stubborn waves and curls that like to stick out everywhere when allowed to be free, and I'm so sick of having to spend forever scorching my hair in order to look put together. This flat iron smooths out my hair in one or two swipes on high heat, and I'm good to go in 15 minutes or less. Plus, the argan oil that came in the box makes my hair silky soft and smells so nice. HSI, where have you been all my life??",5
"For having a lot of great reviews, this straightener did not live up to my expectations. I will say besides the great price, it nicely packaged with the argan oil, heat protectant glove, and a nice carrying case. However, each time I plugged it in, I had to push the reset button. Not a big deal, but seems unnecessary when I have other similar plugs for hair products and this is never an issue. I wasn't impressed with the grip, it wasn't very comfortable to hold for even a short time. Most importantly, when I used it, it tugged at individual hairs like no other flat iron I have used. Also, the frizz reduction did not happen. Unfortunately for me, this one was a bust.",2
"It is a great product. Works as well as more expensive ones. For really curly hair as mine, it does the job more quickly than many others.",5
"This is my first hair straightening iron.  It is easy to use, has temperature control and performs as expected.  It is sturdy and nice on my hair which is color treated.  I highly recommend this product!",4
"After diligent research, this was the best straightener I could find under $100 and my girlfriend loves it.I can't describe using it from personal experience but I have heard no complaints and nothing but good things about it.",5
I love this staraightener. It moves smoothly through my hair without snagging. It heats up fast and leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth. The only con would be that it doesn't have an automatic shut off.,4
"I bought this flat iron and am very happy that I did!  It is much easier to use than I thought it would be and, along with HSI Argon Oil, leaves my hair soft and silky.  I selected this product partially based on other reviews and I have to concur with them.",5
"I was a little skeptical that this flat iron could be better than a Chi, but once I used it I was convinced. The ceramic plates made my hair so silky smooth! The only time my press comes out good like that is when I go to the salon. I have been using the same flat iron for over three years now, so it was definitely time for an upgrade. The price on Amazon was excellent. This flat iron is worth $200, but I only paid $35 on Amazon. There is even a Groupon deal for $45 right now. The argon oil that came with it was wonderful! Definitely the best flat iron I have ever owned.",5
"does what it says it does, works very well! i have hard to straiten hair and it only takes a half an hour to do my hair.  my hair is way down my back and frizzy/curly",5
"This straightener smooths my hair better than any other I've tried. I typically don't actually straighten, but curl/wave my hair to tame this mixed textured mess that is my hair. :) The only changes I would make is the time it takes to heat (I have to use almost the hottest setting, which has always been typical of my hair) and I wish it had a built in prop so it could sit up off the counter between passes.",4
Love it! I love how fast it heats up. It leaves a great shine in my hair.  It is very easy to use.  I highly recommend this product.,5
"I received my package very fast.  faster than I would've thought I would!  the flat iron is wonderful.  it glides right through my hair when I use it and doesn't pull at all.  this flat iron should never receive any bad reviews.  for the ones of u who have it a bad  review,  you must of been one in a million. bc  I've already bought 2!  one for me and one for a  friend!  love love love it!",5
"I love my tourmaline flat iron straightener and i love that it came with the protector glove and bag plus the oil, its all good.",5
"I have thick, wavy hair and this straighter works great. Love how I can give my hair some curl as well. Recommend this product.",5
Great value. Works as well as a professional flat iron but not the high end price. My only complaint is that it is a bit bulky and heavy.,4
I've only used this once and so far it's great! I have thick wavy hair and it made my hair smooth and perfectly straight.,5
Works Great! I love how it actually flips my hair at the ends unlike several other straighteners I have tried. And keeps it straight all day!,5
"Good price, great look, great results is my experience with blue novelties and the product. I needed a flat iron and they gave me an excellent alternative. Thanks",5
"This item was purchased by Mary my wife who is writing this review.  So far I have been very impressed with this item.  It came beautifully packaged with added features including a storage bag, glove and hair product.  I have only used it a few times, so still perfecting my technique, but have received many compliments on how nice my hair looks.  I have wavy hair, not curly and once I am finished blow drying, I use the iron to make my style look sleek, shiny, and sassy. The iron heats up quickly and I love the variable heating dial on the unit. I wasn't sure if I wanted a 1"" or 1 1/4"" model, but am very happy I selected this 1"" model.  Thanks for a wonderful iron.  It is a very professional unit at a very affordable price.",5
This is a nice flat iron.  I got a good deal on it but otherwise I wouldn't pay retail for it.  It is a little heavy and the temp. dial is kind of hard to get to due to the location of it.  It is located on the inside of the iron and has a little dial that you need to adjust.  It does heat up quickly. I've only had it a couple of weeks but so far I'm satisfied with it.,4
"This straightener was purchased to replace another of the same brand which I had purchased a year ago and which lasted only six months. I had purchased another, cheaper replacement but was never satisfied with the results. So I decided to purchase another of this brand to see if perhaps the quick death of the original was simply an anomaly.I have naturally frizzy hair. This straightener smooths it very well. The best I've tried. I have taken my hair from a frizzy mess to straight and smooth without needing to take a shower and dry it ""straight"" first. Lovely tool. I hope this one lasts.",5
"I have only bought cheaper flat irons at Target before so this was my first professional flat iron. So far it does exactly what it advertises. I am very happy with the product. It heats up quickly and the ceramic tiles wrap around the edge so you can flip or curl ends. It doesnt appear to automatically shut off like my last one.Blue Novelties is the company that provided and shipped the product. I chose free shipping through amazon but when I received the postal slip that it was at the post office it said postage was due. I emailed Blue Novelties and they responded within a day and apologized and replied if I did indeed have to pay that my account would be credited. I did pay the extra $5.65 for postage and emailed them with a picture of the postage. There was no hassle what so ever and Blue Novelties was apologetic and issue a credit immediately. I would not hesitate to buy through Blue Novelties. They were prompt in replying, apologetic, and issued a credit immediately.",5
"This comes with a sample of Argon oil.  Once you apply few drops of it and use this flat Iron, it makes your hair perfectly straight in minutes. The final appearance of the hair looks professional too. Great for the price. As I did not want to invest hundreds on a straightener, I choose this and am happy with it.I would recommend it to a friend.",5
"Excellent straightener, excellent customer service.  Ordered it and it was delivered promptly.  I also used the Argan oil which was sent and that is absolutely fabulous.  The straightener heats up quickly, straightens easily without drying and burning my hair.  I have split ends from my old straightener and coloring my hair,and my hair is very very wavy with a lot of friz, so I still have to use a lot of products on my hair. But I have noticed that with using the argan oil and this straightner, my hair is sooooo much more smoother and shinier and takes half the amount of time getting it straight and smooth then it did before using these two products. JUST LOVE BOTH!!!!JUST A SIDE BAR:  BUY THE ARGAN OIL AT YOUR LOCAL DRUG STORE....WAY CHEAPER THAN ANYTHING YOU WILL FIND ON AMAZON OR ONLINE....IT'S THE SAME THING AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW IT WORKS!!",5
The HSI is everything everyone said it would be. An excellent choice. Straightens amazing. Love that it comes with its own case for easy storage. Super fast to style your hair. I wolud definetly recommend to all looking for a good device.,5
"This flat iron met my expectations.  This is the first I've owned, so I cannot compare the quality to another brand.  It seems to do a good job (I'm still learning the art of flat-ironing hair, so it still feels a little awkward).",3
Heats up very quickly and been using it for months no problems at all.definitely worth what I paid for it,5
The straightener works great and I love the glove and argan oil it comes with. It heats up quickly and my hair feels so soft and silky that I can't help but run my fingers through my hair every 10 minutes.,5
"Heats up and cools down really fast.  Leaves hair smooth and shiny.  Only complaint is that my hair seems to catch when I get to the ends, and pulls a little bit. Minor and worth ignoring because it is such a quality product.",5
Great product. Easy to use. Heats up immediately. Comes with a glove but I don't even need to use it. Makes your hair shiny and straight without a blowout. Highly recommended.,5
I replaced my chi iron (after ten years) with this no name iron. I didn't want to spend 100 bucks on another chi. I've been using it for over a month now and it is working pretty well. Really no difference fr my old chi. It actually gets hotter which is nice.,5
"I purchased this flat iron based on the excellent reviews and have not been disappointed. It works as well as the more expensive, well-known brands. Definitely a winner!",5
This is the best flat iron I have ever bought in my entire life and i have course curly hair.,5
"Great replacement for my older model flat iron.  Didn't realize that it has a test/reset button and had a 'duh moment' when it didn't heat up the first time I wanted to use it.  It heats up very quickly and does have a light on it which is red while heating to the temperature and it turns green when ready.  Mine did come with a carrying pouch, glove (which I don't think I will use) and a sample of the Argan Oil.  I have been using the iron for just over a week and am very happy I purchased it.",5
"I had bought this flat iron in september, and I don't know if I dropped it (probably) or what, but one of the plates got a huge crack in it. I was really bummed out since this is one of the only heat products that manages to curl my aesthetically coarse looking, but actually pretty fine hair. It doesn't curl curl it like some prom/wedding hairdo, but I can get waves in. It also, obviously, does a great job of straightening my hair so it is super flat, and it feels nice - not dry.  Anyway, to send it to HSI and get it repaired would have cost more than just buying a new one, so I bought a new one. The shipping was faster the first time I bought this, but still awfully fast for this one (both were purchased from blue novelties). Obviously if one of the plates cracks again, I'll know it's a product issue, but for now this is a great flat iron, especially for the price. My other flat iron is the much bigger chi, which was about triple the price of this one, and I use this one more.",5
This is a wonderful product! Does exactly what it says and is high quality. Very pleased with the price I paid also.,4
"I have only used it once so far, but really like it.. purchased it for when I work out at work and need something at the gym for after.  So it will be perfect for that.  Heats fast, with multiple settings..",4
"I love these flat irons!!  I am an African-American woman. I have natural hair and typically wear braids. I wanted irons that would allow me to straighten and  style my own hair with the same results as the professional stylists. These irons are the best. They leave my hair so silky. An I must add that I am a novice. I have never had great success styling my own hair. But after the encouragement and tutelage of my new hair stylist armed with a conditioner from the heavens by Joico, I gave it a try and I must say, these flat irons are....an  Amazing product. The handles don't heat up and burn my hands. They do exactly what my friend said they would. I was sooo excited that I washed, straightened and styled my daughter's hair too. She also has natural hair. She is an athlete and I typically leave her hair curly because she works out alot and I prefer not to apply heat to her hair regularly. But I just had to see. They worked very well. She was beaming with joy. Her hair was silky and straight, with one pass through.",5
I read the reviews before ordering and I fully agree. Great product. Definitely combine this with the Argan oil. Makes my hair smooth and it has been less dry and people have been complimenting me on my hair.,5
"One of the best things I have bought for my hair. I use the medium setting and my hair is soft and shiny. I have pure white almost shoulder length hair that I wear straight and turned under at the end. I have not color or perm my hair in over 25 years. I receive comments on my hair color very day. ""Is that your real hair color?"" Sigh...Now I get compliments. It is faster than my curling iron and so much nicer results. The price was awesome. Beautifully packaged. Highy recommend for untreated hair for sure.",5
A great flat iron for a reasonable price. Gets just as hot as the more expensive irons and works great.,4
"MY WIFE LOVES IT , SHE USUALLY GOES THROUGH ONE A YEAR ,THIS WAY BETTER QUALITY AND GETS WAY HOTTER THAN THE OTHERS",5
"I didn't think I was going to notice a difference from one flat iron to the next.  Clearly, I was wrong.  HSI is so much faster, smoother, and overall much better than the ordinary flat iron.  A good friend of mine, whom is also a professional hair & makeup stylist agreed that this is a great flat iron.  Her coworkers also agreed and recommended I get it.  And with the offered price - you can't go wrong.",5
Excellent Product..I highly recommend it for ladies who what to style their own hair like the salon...quality flat iron that comes with a convenient case.,5
"I love how this straightener gets hot quickly, it also does a wonderful job making my hair smooth and silky :)I love it much more than my old one and it doesn't get caught on my hair and pull it like several flat irons in the past have.It is versatile in doing flips and curls.Love love love this product :) Definitely recommended!",5
"I love this flat iron. I found it on ebay for $54 including shipping. it works way better than any Chi I ever had.  this is the only brand i've used besides Jilbere & Chi &  i'm so happy with it because it straightens my hair really well, & although the plates get hot, the flat iron itself doesn't (like the Jilbere burnt my fingers). in comparison the Chi seems like a piece of junk.  the HSI is a really well-made quality product that works great, for a great price.  you will not be disappointed.",5
"I have a patch of gray hair on my temple which is unruly and does not fit in with my idea of a sleek, smooth bob hair style.  I tried a curling iron but that did not work so well.  I tried this flat iron based on the recommendations and I am super pleased with the results.  It is easier to use than a curling iron and the results are much better.  I use a bit of the oil provided, which also enhances the look.  Good results, good value, easy to use.",5
I love this straightener. It is by far one of the best products I own. I use it everyday and would reccomend it to anyone looking to buy one.,5
"This straightener is so awesome and what makes it even more awesome is the price! The straightener paired with the HSI professional blow dryer has made my once frizzy hair, so soft and beautiful!",5
"I love this flat iron. I don't flat iron my hair often but when I do I know I can count on this flat iron to get the job done. It heats up quickly, straightens with one or two pass throughs, and it curls pretty well also!!",5
I have very thick hard to control hair and this straightener has worked amazing so far! The best one I have had yet. I have tried several other brands and they don't even compare to HSI.,5
"I was sucked in by all the high reviews on this product, but I really wonder who they came from. All three of my daughters and I tried the product and were very disappointed. It's awkwardly designed, pulls your hair and leaves it frizzy, and just doesn't work well. Very disappointing. Fortunately, the return process was great!",2
"I ordered this for my wife and daughter, but it is so easy to handle, my wife is calling her friends to straighten their hair! She is crazy about this product. So far, straightening hair seems to be very simple and straight forward. They still need to get used to curling their hair. I hope she wont convert my house to a salon.",5
I waited a few weeks to review this product but it is absolutely amazing. It is a great product and the price is unbelievable. I have ethnic hair and it gets my hair very smooth and sleek. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.,5
"I purchased the straightener/iron and LOVE LOVE LOVE it..  I have very fine frizzy hair (yes kinky greys) i set it on 12 about the middle of control and within minutes my hair is frizz free and supper soft... I love the fact that is has temperature control.I wish I had saved myself over double the cost on a CHI iron with no temp control and bought this one first. The CHI tends to snag on the edges OUCH this one does not its a super smooth iron.. you will LOVE IT i guarantee it. OH and is sorta curved on the edges of the iron so FLIPPING your hair is a breeze to.... YOU WONT go wrong ordering this. BONUS was i received mine within two days i think, super fast shipping.",5
"So I received my straightener the day it said I would and I just used it yesterday. Can I just say that my hair is still super soft, free of frizz, and super shiny. I bought this one as a replacement to my old one that I've had for over 5 years and it ranks #1 just as my old one did. I so was not expecting the bonuses within the box like the argan oil and the heat glove but I love them. Thanks to the seller for prompt delivery seeing as I needed it for court the other day.P.S. if you have frizzy coarse thick ""unmanageable"" hair this is the product for you",5
"I love my new HSI flat iron.  I can get the natural looking waves I've wanted in less than 10 mins.  This iron is easy to use - since it was my first time using a flat iron, it took me a few minutes to get the hang of it, but then presto - perfect, loose, easy, curls!  It comes with a nice satin pouch, heat protecting glove & a free sample of HSI Argan oil.  The oil smells divine and is great for smoothing out frizz or conditioning split ends.  I highly recommend this flat iron!",5
"I used only a CHI for several years and loved it, until I broke it. So I began my search for a new CHI. While searching for a new CHI, I kept coming across the HSI flat iron. I began doing a little more research and after reading tons of reviews on several sites I decided to order the HSI flat iron. It is even better than my CHI was. I love the adjustable heat setting. I'm  able to do my hair at a high setting and then lower the setting for my girls. I have two small girls one with really fine hair and one with really curly hair and it worked wonderfully for all of us.",5
"My Turboion Croc finally broke after dropping it one too many times, so I needed a new iron. I was happy with the quality of the Croc but based on all of the great reviews for the HSI, I thought it would be fun to try something different. I found that it did not straighten or smooth well and the plates also pulled on my hairs. I also missed the digital temperature feature on the Croc. It seemed I had to use a higher temp to get the same effect, but I can't really be certain because the dial is so small and hard to see. I think I prefer titanium plates and the digital temp feature so I'm returning it for the BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium. Hopefully that will work much better!",2
"I love this iron!  It heats up pretty fast so you don't have to wait too long, especially when I'm in a hurry.  I usually use come heat protectant products plus the HSI argan oil (which smells good :]) and when I glide down iron down my hair, it comes out shiny, soft, and overall more healthy looking from my damaged hair.  What was the best thing about this iron is that the price was so reasonable compared to the other irons out there that charge you $100 or more.  I love HSI!!!",5
"Not what I thought it was, it doesnt get any hotter or sleeker then my old generic did, but i use it",3
"I've had a lot of hair straightners but this one wasn't one of my best, I had to return the first one I got because it was a bad one. But then they sent me another it does work good once it gets heated up all the way but sometimes when you start using it the red light will pop up again saying it needs to heat up more. But it will straighten your hair. I just rather use a chi.",2
"This simply didn't get hot enough to offer any kind of real lasting power.  The clamp didn't seem to hold much hair either.--- UPDATE... FOUND THE PERFECT FLAT IRON... BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium 1 1/2 """,2
"I was looking for a straightner for a while and when I read the reviews, I thought it was a good straightner. When I received it and tried it out, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't leave my hair shiny and smooth like other straightners I've tried.",3
I was excited about getting this. But when I used it it would not stay hot long enough to strighten my hair.I loved all the things that came with it. Just wished it stayed hot.,2
"I dropped this ~3 feet the second week I had this and both ceramix plates popped right out and parts cracked.  I've had CHIs for years and dropped them regularly without them breaking.  This is a fragile flat iron.  If you can be very careful with it, it would be a good product.  It gets very hot and heats up pretty quick.",2
"The only thing that sold me about this product was the PRICE AND the reviews. But I feel that the reviews are a bit overhyped. I expected unicorns and rainbows to come out of this thing but..it was just a regular hair straightener. I feel that this straightener is no different than any other Target brand (or any other low end) hair straightener. It's okay. Nothing special. And to know that this was once priced at almost $300-$400?? That's just ridiculous. If I had paid full original price for this, I would not have been a happy camper. But because I bought it at $40...it's forgivable.",3
"I bought this straightener based on all of the great reviews I read on Amazon. It worked well enough, but nothing really impressive. Unfortunately a few months after buying it it fell off the table while it was hot and the ceramic broke. It wasn't even on tile, just carpet. I probably can't blame it on the manufacturing, since it was my fault it dropped on the ground, but it wasn't anything amazing while it was working, either.",3
"So I never write reviews because I hardly ever love something so much that I am compelled to do so. But this flat iron is exactly what I was looking for and I had to share! I have med length fine hair. I waned to find a flat iron that could straighten but also curl and create waves without my hair looking poofy or frizzy or like Shirley temple. This is it!! I have never been able to do my hair like I can with this flat iron! I've tried other flat irons, different curling irons, blow drying with different brushes, the list goes on...if u are looking for a styling tool that can give you straight hair, wavy hair or curly hair BUY THIS ONE!",5
"Works very professionally, easy to use. Great price for the styler, very happy with results.I received the Flat Iron ahead of projected time.",4
Peruvian pigs never thought they could look soooo good.Pros:Makes thick and wavy hair straighten easily and fastBest bang for your buckGood ergonomics allows amateurs to handle it like a proMakes hair silky soft with the include Argan Oil sampleCons:No auto shutoff timer,5
"Pretty basic, nothing fancy but it gets the job done.  The on/off switch and temperature knob are kind of strangely placed in the inner area.  If I had realized it didn't have an auto shut off, I wouldn't have chosen this model.",3
"works great, gets very hot.. i have very curly hair so it takes a lot of heat and pressure to force it straight! comes with a straightening serum, working pretty good too!",5
The HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener is exactly as described. It costs half the price of the Brand-name hair straghteners and does equally as well. A great value.,5
Exactly what I wanted and works great. Doesn't damage my hair and heats up in no time. Just be careful because it does heat up really well. So make sure you check your temperature setting.,5
I'm really enjoying this flat iron!  It does a great job of straightening my very wavy hair. I like it better than the Chi iron.,5
"I bought this based on the reviews, not disappointed.  Heats up fast and hot and like the curved ends for flipping hair under.  Works great!  Received it quickly!",5
"i was REALLY excited to recieve this and although it came a little late, i was happy. when i opened it, it was obviously used and returned. the bottle of oil was empty and the cord was all over the place. but putting that aside i tried using it, the temperature button was really hard to get to and hard to turn if your fringers are slippery. then even at the highest temperature, it was really cool. i tried straightening my hair and it isnt thick very thin actually, but it took me 3-4 times to go over that strand to make it straight. also, it has a really smell to it like burning metal, it stunk up my whole bathroom. i am going to return this and i would not recommend it. also, the straightener pulled on each end of every strand of hair. it really hurts",3
Bought this for my fiancee and she loved it. It is a quality flat iron. I would highly recommend this product,5
"My daughter has this curly hair and hasn't mastered straightening it yet (she's 14). This straightener has been awesome for her to use! It's heavy duty, has a long cord,  works beautifully, . and it's only downfall is there is no ""on"" or LED power light? The switch is small and inside the handle, so you have to look hard to see if its off.",4
"After owning many name brand irons, and having them die on me after 1-2 years, I decided to save a few bucks and buy this one based on reviews. I figured even if it only lasted a few months, or even a year, I'd get my money's worth.Well, let me tell you, this thing has impressed me. I have used it daily, for about 8 months now and it is still going strong.I really like the adjustable heat setting, some basic brand names only have on/off switch.I have really course, thick, and mostly unmanageable hair and this thing is able to tackle it into shape, quickly, smoothly and efficiently :)It also comes with a neat carry bag (which I don't use, but nice any way), a small sample of Argan oil, which smells marvelous, works wonderfully, and is just basically super great!, and a styling glove so you wont burn your hand while styling.Also, it has an automatic safety ""shut-off"" after 10 ( or 15?) mins of no use! What an awesome feature! I know I have always left mine plugged in and worried if i left it on...? Now, thats not a problem :)So, all in all, a GREAT buy, definitely worth a try.",5
"Pros- Heats fast- Ease of use- Quick application- Adjustable heating featureCons- Would like it to get a little hotter at the top settingI bought this for the lady. She loves it! Much cheaper than the Chi branded straighteners.As I'm writing this, she's providing feedback. She says that for a straightener, it doesn't curl well. To me, that's crazy talk, but I guess some women actually use straighteners to apply curl so they don't have to use multiple products. Just craziness.Either way, I saved quite a bit buying this thing. She has no complaints at all. For an affordable price, you get a great build quality with a chic case.",5
I have tried this hair straightener four times and it  just won't get hot (barely warm).  Am I doing something wrong?,1
"I bought this in October of 2012, and in January 2013 for the first time, it accidentally slipped off my bathroom counter and fell onto my tile floor. The corner chipped off and now there's a crack, lengthwise, down one of the ceramic plates. I can't even use it anymore since it rips my hair to pieces. One of the biggest reasons I bought it was because of the raving reviews about their customer service (In case someone else needs to find them, contact them here: [...]). After contacting their customer service, which did respond quickly (kinda, but that's another story!), they told me that drops are not covered under the warranty. I understand that, but I would hope a product, that is going to be used in bathrooms (and that are usually tiled), would be able to at least withstand one drop. I really liked this flat iron when I had it, but unfortunately now I need to find a replacement. In all fairness, the CS agent gave me a $20 off code to use on another flat iron from their website. But, since they're marked up in price on their site, Amazon is still a better deal. Plus, why would I want to buy another one, because of course at some point it is going to slip off my counter. Just a heads up to future buyers.Update: I contacted Amazon about returning this flat iron, and even though I'm well past the return by date, they will still accept my return, with a 20% restocking fee. Better than nothing!",2
"I love this straightener.  I was extremely disappointed when it broke, but I loved it so much and it's so affordable I was going to buy a new one.  I decided to contact the seller first and ask if there was anything they could do.  To my surprise, they sent me a brand new one, free of charge!  I love that you can straighten or curl with it.  Just perfect!",5
"Wasn't sure whether to choose 3 or 4 stars. This straightener is not bad, but it's definitely no professional styler. You do seem to get what you pay for in *most* cases. I decided to purchase this one on Amazon after reading reviews. I wanted to see if a cheaper flat iron could do the job okay. I'd previously had a T3 and a Chi from ebay. The T3 worked really well. I'm not sure if it was legit or not, but I don't think it was b/c when I sent in the warranty card it came back as undeliverable. The problem with the T3 was that the hinge was really weak and kept breaking. I gorilla glued it 3 times, but after the 4th it just wouldn't hold anymore. The Chi worked decently as well, but definitely was not legit. After those experiences with ebay and not being able to afford full price for a legit straightener I chose this one.It works better on my hair when I've let it air dry for some reason. I don't really like the edges that grip b/c it feels like it's damaging my hair. The nice part about the gripping edges is that the hair doesn't slip out easily as it did with the T3. I pretty much had to put the HSI on the hottest setting to straighten my hair, but it still wasn't as good as the T3 in getting nice, sleek tresses.Also, I recently got my hair cut and I could not for the life of me get the HSI to do what my stylist did with her flat iron. I'm not sure what kind she had--I'll find out--and I'm not sure if it's just her expertise that helped??All that said, I've just ordered a GHD from Amazon as I'm expecting my tax return soon. The GHD will be the first ""full price"" styler I've bought, though Amazon had quite a decent discount on it.I'll update my review after I receive it and compare the two.",4

"The product name pretty much captures it. Ceramic, compare to metal on cheaper hair straighteners, is believed to cause less damage to hair. This particular model is well built and comes with some extras like a pouch etc. Also the price is unbeatable.Update on the price: when I purchased this product it was priced at 39.99 dollars, and now, apparently, the price went up $10 more to $49.99.  I really don't like to see some of the great products on amazon kept increasing their price, just because they have wonderful reviews so that they can sell them at a higher price and people are still willing to pay for them. Well, I was still satisfied for what I paid for, but I hope this information can help some people.",5
"I received this flat iron about a week ago.  I have used it 4 times, each time hoping it will work well.  The thing is, it doesn't get as hot as it said it should. Definitely does NOT get up to 400 degrees.  I have thick, wavy hair. I used to own a Chi for this reason.  I couldn't believe the HSI had such great reviews for the price! I was really hoping this would be as good as Chi because of the reviews I read on it....but like they say, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  Now I am on the journey to returning the cheap thing.  By the way, I owned a remington wet-to-straight for 14 years, I bought it at Rite-Aid...it got much hotter than this tool.  I will say, I did not have the clamping issues that some people had, it looks nice,  I like the grip on it. The argon oil they send you that is sample size is pretty amazing, but I only got to use mine once as the lid was not tight and spilled ought in shipping.",3
"I purchased this item based on the positive reviews left by other buyers. I've always used a CHI straightener and it just so happened that mine stopped working a few days before this HSI was a lightning deal. I was so excited when it arrived that I immediately took it from the box to try it out. The first thing I noticed was how long it took to reach temperature. I tested it several times before the light turned green to see if maybe the setting were a little wonky, It wasn't, so I waited some more. After 10 minuets of heating the light finally turned green. It took FOREVER to straighten my hair with this thing. It never got hot enough and after 2 or 3 passes through my hair the light signaled that it was back in the heating stage.  I'm Caucasian and my hair is of medium thickness with very little curl.I thought that the product I received must be faulty so I contacted Amazon and received another two day later. I took it from the box, plugged it in and again had to wait about 10 minuets to get the go ahead from this thing.  Same disappointment from the new one. I decided to keep it simply because I would have felt bad returning the same product back to Amazon twice. I've been using this thing for a few months now and as long as I make sure I let it heat up while I'm blow drying my hair and do my make up it will reach a temperature that will straighten my hair. It still takes forever to use and It still losses heat after a few passes through my hair. I cant wait until I can find a CHI on sale to replace this thing, If I had to compare it's performance to another straightener I would say it works about as good as the Conair I had in high school 15 years ago. I gave it two stars simply because it will turn on and after about 30 minuets of use plus 10 minuets of heating It does leave my hair straight. I also like the glove that came with the product as it protects my hand from the unusually hot temperature of the plastic casing while I'm using it. The packaging was nice also and the travel bag is useful.Maybe I received two bad straighteners but I doubt it.",2
This is a very high quality flat iron.  The temperature control feature is excellent and the glove protective of my hand.,5
"I am a black female with natural coarse hair.  This flat iron made my hair bone straight and my hair is very tightly coiled.  When I use Tresemme heat spray as a heat protectant, my hair looks amazing!  I would highly recommend this flat iron.",5
"After purchasing numerous flat irons, I finally have one that does what I need it to do. After using it on my relaxed hair it is as shiny, full of body and smooth as when I leave the salon. The real test will come when I use it on my daughter's thick and natural curly hair. I will write another review on the outcome of that.",5
"""There is no way this iron is worth the retail price. This flat iron takes way too long to heat completely and my hair doesn't stay straight all day. Maybe this doesn't work as well for me because I have a lot of hair, and it's long and thick. But I had a Chi before this iron and it worked very well with my hair. Because I read reviews from people comparing this iron to brands like Chi, I expected similar quality. But because I only had to pay $40, instead of the full retail price, I can't rate it any lower than a 3. If you don't want to pay more than $40, this is a good iron. But I expected better quality, so I was disappointed :/.""",3
"I have had this for several years (3-4) and it is still going strong. Doesn't damage my hair, does it's job very well.",5
"for the price this hot iron is great!!! I read that reviews that this iron was better than the CHI so I decided to buy it. It's good, but I can't decide if it better than the CHI since my CHI iron was very old and really needed to be replaced. definitely worth the price though.",4
"i wanted to try this iron after having many different irons, including the chi. this is nothing out of the ordinary, it doesn't work miracles on your hair, it simple irons it- O.K. just as any other new iron, i suppose. it was not too bad for the price i paid. i rather pay double and buy a chi. next time..",3
Amazing straightens beautifully!Also gives amazing curls that last all day :)And to top it off I got an amazing deal at 75% off!,5
"As far as I know, this is a quality product.  I bought it as a gift for my wife.  A little back-story, she had bought a professional hair straightener ten years ago and it finally died out.  I have bought her several hair straighteners that did not live up to expectations.  Much to my relief, she is satisfied with this one.  From one husband of a picky wife, I would definitely recommend.",5
bought this for my teen daughter for Christmas> She loves it for what it does for her hair. And I loved the price. looks like its a keeper,5
"I bought the HSI ceramic flat iron after watching how-to videos on YouTube, on how to straighten and curl your hair with a flat iron. It looks SOOOO much better than how I ever styled my hair before.",5
"She loves it, she's moving from a 8 year old generic hair straightener to something a little more modern and heavy duty. She said she loves the many different heat settings and is working on finding the right balance.",5
"I bought this straightner so I can start doing curls with straigtner, so far so good I am still mastering the technique. Defiantly recommend!",5
This product was purchased instead of the In-Styler product. As a straightener it is perfect but the one thing that I wish it had was the option to put on a round brush for curling hair. Obviously the price was right! I haven't had it long enough to know how long it will last but so far so good!,4
Great product I would recommend it to anyone! I really enjoyed what I received. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year,5
"I order this flat iron for my daughter. Her Chi iron got damaged and we bought another Chi iron that she thought was the best of all of them.  When she tried the iron she was actually disappointed with its performance and we returned it.  She then went online and found this iron.  She told me that the reviews were very good and she wanted to try it.  We ordered the iron very close to Christmas and I was nervous that the iron was not going to arrive on time-. She was going to another country for the holidays and she needed the iron more than anything.  Well, not only the iron arrived on time but my daughter couldn't be happier with her iron.  She said that it is the best iron she has had. She has a long curly hair and it is very important for her having her hair perfectly straight and shiny all the time. I am very happy that we bought it and extremely happy with the price.  I highly recommend this product.",5
I bought this even with the hit and miss reviews. This is indeed a wonderful flat iron my hair is thick and wavy and long it use to take me hours to flat iron my hair now it only takes 45 mins to an hour at the most I would deffently recommend this product to anyone.,5
"After reading product description, decided to give it a try.  Happy that I did-it arrived well protected with a carrying bag included. It has a commercial type plug for safety. It also comes with a sample of argan oil. Not only does it look professional it performs well-both for straightening and curling.  It heats up in less than a minute, with variable heat settings.  Controls are out of the way-unlike my last iron. The heads float and create a smooth line.  My hair does not get caught in it like my last one. I am pleased with the iron and would recommend it. Good deal considering the price and quality.",5
Bought this for my fiance and she loves it!  Great quality product!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a professional flat iron.,5
"I think i had 5 flat iron in my drawers and not all of them satisfied me. It straight my hair fine but its too long to get my hair done & most often i have a lot of hair fall. Then last year we spent christmas at my in law house. And i met this bad girl in my sister in law's bathroom, i ask to try it. And im like.... OHhhh my god! Im in love. Then i was like OK i need you in my life and i ordered the next morning. And ever since im happy with my purchased. I love it, and i don't have to struggle straightening my hair in hour and worried & irritated that my hair falls and dry. Girls who looking for a good flat iron, i highly recommend this, you wont regret buying it. Its worth the money promise ;)",5
"The iron machine is easy to use and gets hot very fast...My only issue is, I have a long hair and is taking me a long time to finish to straight out my hair, because the iron machine is small for my hair size.But is a great machine for the price I paid for :)",4
"I was looking for a flat iron that would work on my hair as well as my daughters hair.  We both have different texture hair but need an iron that gets pretty hot.  I had an FHI for a little over a year.  We loved that iron.  We also paid over $100 for that flat iron.  After a year it got a short in it and wouldn't stay on.  I was upset and was not willing to pay that price again only to have it for a year.  A few weeks later on one of the coupon sites I frequent (hip2save) she said there was a flat iron on amazon for 40 and it had over 2000 reviews with like 4 1/2 stars. I decided to give it a try. I am extremely happy with it.  Its just like my FHI but it doesn't go up to 450 degrees but 410 is just fine.My daughter has thick, wavy, natural (NOT RELAXED) semi-coarse hair.  Once we use the flat iron her hair with no relaxer is silky, bouncey and full of life.  My hair is kind of fine But extremely curly.  I have very tight spiral curls.  My hair is more than halfway down my back about three inches from my behind when it is straight.  When my hair is curly it is just a little past my shoulders.  Just so you can understand how curly it is.  Alot of flat irons are not able to straighten out my mega curls so if I can find one that can do the job I'm extremely happy.  I am thinking about buying another one so I don't have to share with my daughter.  We brought this iron back in August 2012 and I'm still happy with it.I would definitely say buy it.  It really works on ethnic hair (even non relaxed), spanish hair and curly hair.",5
"Did not work well on my hair. Not hot enough and was not comfortable to use. Sent it back , no problem",2
The best flat iron ever. I have super thick wavy hair and this flat iron smooths it out in no time.,5
This is the best straightener I have ever had and I have had lots of them. Love the heat adjuster and straightens on the first go through!!,5
"I wish I had ordered this flat iron a long time ago! I had no idea what I was missing.  I would rate it as ""salon quality"" - it is the best one I've ever owned. It comes with a beautiful travel bag and a very nice heat resistant glove, but I haven't had to use it because I've yet to burn myself while using it.  My hair finally looks as straight and shiny as when my stylist does it.  And it stays that way all day long, no matter what the weather.  With my old straightener, my hair would already be frizzing and waving a little on humid days before I could even get out of the house.  Not with this one!  It still looks good when I wake up in the morning, too.  I am very, very happy with this product and feel that its an excellent value for the money!",5
This straightner is wonderful! And you just cannot beat the price. i have very naturally curly hair. i was so shocked to see it turn out beautifully smooth and straight with this product - and without any damadge!,5
"I was very pleased when I recieved this product. It came very quick, which was exactly what I needed. I didn't realize it would come with all the extras. Needless to say, 2 thumbs up!",5
"I recently bought this item for my you get sister because she needed a straightener. Later on my older sister, after trying it out asked me to get her one too! It is the best straightener I have ever used and is doing a good job replacing my Chi that broke recently. I would highly suggest this item it is a good price and very good quality.",5
I have used this iron a few times and so far I am very pleased with it. It doesn't pull my hair like other ones have.,4
After reading reviews on the chi and hsi. I decided to take a chance with the hsi..you cant beat the price. I received the straightener right away. I bought to use on my daughters hair which is very curly and thick. The hsi straightened it with no problem. I am very pleased with it. I even went to work the next day talking about it.,5
"Worth the money, bought a cheaper one before and it ripped my hair out.  This one works great and I get my hair done faster.",5
"I have thick wavy, medium length  hair.  After I started using this flat iron, several co-workers asked me if I had my hair done - it looked so good!  I love this flat iron!  Makes straightening so much easier and faster.",5
"I had have around 10 or maybe more iron straightens since Ii was a teen.This is the first one that gives me the results I been looking for, quick and easy, and with the oil that comes with it, it makes the whole process a lot faster, and my hair looks beautiful afterwards.I have thick wavy hair, so I know how things can be. I really recommend this product, I'm a happy costumer, the service was great and it arrived on time.Give it a try, for this price, you won't find anything better.",5
I have a ton of hair and this product gets hot quickly and stays hot.  I am able to get my hair straightened in less than half the time it took with my old straightener.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.,5
"I am a long time Chi user, and sadly as with so many, my cord shorted out.  Not wanting to spend another $150 on a defective product, I decided to give HSI a try.  I am very, VERY pleased with this high quality straightener.  This straightener gets up to 410 degrees, nice and hot.  It is also very solid and heavy, not chintzy like you might expect for something at this price.  My hair is as straight as my stylist gets it when I go to the salon.  And the Argan oil sample is a great bonus, adds shine to my hair without grease or heaviness.  If you're in the same boat I was, I don't think you'll be sorry with this one.",5
"This is the first flat iron I have ever owned or used. I bought it for my daughter, who has thick, wavy, and sometimes curly hair, around chin length. I did her hair for her the other day, and this worked nicely. It took about 15 or 20 minutes, and did exactly what I expected: straightened her hair! I was inspired to try it out on my hair, which is well past my shoulders, thick, coarse, and very curly. I brushed my hair out and then spent about an hour to straighten my hair. This is the first time I have ever attempted it on my own, so that doesn't seem that crazy to me, frankly. It got my hair pretty straight, but there was plenty of frizz. The oil definitely helped. Overall, I think it did a good job, but I feel like my hair length and texture definitely gave it a run for its money. I had to run through some areas several times, and the next day I did some touch up. My curls were definitely fighting to be seen. Blow-drying your hair straight as step 1 would probably make this an easier task. I probably won't bother with my hair again, but will definitely be nice for my daughter. I appreciated the included glove. The iron seemed to get hot quickly and stay hot. My biggest gripe would be the location of the power and heat dial. They are on the inside part of the iron, which makes it somewhat awkward, particularly if you need to adjust the heat setting. For the price, though, I am happy.",4
"I am very pleased with this item, it looks and feels like a good quality hair straightener and does a very good job. I have never used an expensive hair straightener myself(just seen my daughters) so not able to compare the use of the two but very happy with the outcome on my hair with this one. The little bottle of oil that came with it is a bonus and will buy buying more of the same oil.",5
Straightens hair and gets to temp quickly but doesn't stay incredibly hot the entire time. For bangs it works excellent. I love the oil included. Cons: No automatic shut off and the placement for on/off/temp is hard to see unless you have bright lighting. It also does not clamp shut. Not sure why.. For the price it is a decent buy and gets the job done but I would not compare it to the Chi. There are a few other brands that are better with the features I like (such as automatic shut off) in the same price range.,4
"My sister bought me one of these a couple years ago, and after some tough treatment, it finally broke. So while looking around for a new flat iron I saw this and got all excited because it was an amazing tool, just small children and alot of traveling and my own clumsiness took its toll.",5
I bought this hair straightener for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! She said that it works well and makes her hair look so smooth and shiny. It heats up quickly but doesn't damage her hair like some irons will do. She is very satisfied with this product.,5
I love this straightener most straighteners won't straighten my hair very well ( very curly hair) but this one is awesome!!! And the shipper is amazing!!!,5
When I opened the package the argon oil cap wasn't on all the way and it spilled on my case and booklet so I didn't get to try the argon oil  I've heard so much about.  The flat iron is great though and they heat up quickly.  I plan on buying one for my sister soon.****Update so its been a while and I've sent about three emails to the seller about my order and I have yet to get a response. Again great flat iron though.,4
"Excellent hair straightener. Would definitely buy again. Works like a professional straightener even on thick, coarse hair. I purchased another straightener many years ago, salon quality and double the price and this one far exceeds that one!",5
The HSI flat iron does work and probably works great for someone else.  I have very thick curly hair (multi-racial) that I have managed to tame for the most part over the last 10 years.  This flat iron gets it straight but not bone straight and not without frizz.  The heating surface is small and my hair is really long so it's a bit of a pain to go through all the trouble of flat iron it with this thing and still needing to follow up with something else.  for quick touch-ups it's great.  It heats up fast and is good for traveling.,3
"This is just an average straightener. I was hoping it would do a better job, but i have to say that it is only so-so. It doesn't get super hot.",3
"Packaging was impressive, it was a pretty good deal for all that's in the box.At first, this worked like a charm. It heated up fast, and made my hair look totally pin straight in just a few minutes.After a few days, however, it didn't seem to work as well, it took a bit longer to straighten my hair like it would with a normal straightener, and took a bit longer to heat up (45 seconds?)After a few weeks, it began to turn on and off, switching from a red light to green light. It wasn't much to complain about since the iron would still remain hot for the few seconds it turned off.Other than the time issues (taking a  while to heat up and turning on and off, and the length of time it takes to do my hair compared to the first try), it's a decent hair straightener. Much better than Revlon's. It's good for the price, but if you want a truly good iron, I recommend spending more on a higher end brand.",3
"I hit a home run with this one.  Considered getting the Chi, but talked to a couple stylists who said the HSI is just as good if not better.  Couldn't beat the price for the holidays, and it was shipped in plenty of time.  The wife can't talk enough about how she's enjoying it.  A hair serum or oil is a must though so your hair doesn't burn.",5
"I lost a lot of hair during my pregnancy and when it grew back the unders were curly and unruly. I tried EVERYTHING. Serums. Gels. Lotions. Shampoos. Conditioners. You name it, I tried it. Until a friend told me to buy a professional grade straightener. I was worried about the price but then I came across this one and thought ""What the hell!"". Like the title says: Best purchase ever. I don't even have to use anymore straightening products. This thing does it all!",5
I have been wanting to get a flat iron for a long time but didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. When I saw this one on sale I decided to try it! I have been very pleased with it. Thanks for the product and good sale!,5
"This feels real good in my hand. Was looking at a wider model (3 inch), but this works just as well. Glad I did get this model, its easier to get the short lengths. Looks to be very good quality for a very good price.",5
"I have been straightening my hair for years and I've tried them all. Cheap ones and straighteners up to $100+. This one is the best deal I have ever got on a straightner. Works just as good, if not better than the most expensive of straightners I've owned. It comes with a heat glove, a nice bag and a sample of their argon oil which is also amazing. Best deal I've got on something useful in a long time! I definitely recommend this product!",5
I love this hair straightener! I read a lot of comments before I decided to buy this product. And it didn't disappoint me at all. It's a great hair straightener. I plan to buy one more for my younger sister. Great product!,5
AMAZING PRODUCT! MY WIFE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HER NEW FLAT IRON AND IT WAS A GREQAT PRICE TO BOOT! THANX HSI.,5
"Best flat iron ever!I bought it as I needed a flat iron since mine stopped working. It was a great price so I thought, why not? I received it and it did wonders for my hair. My hair is very difficult to straighten and sure enough, within minutes it was done! Not hours!!! I LOVE this!",5
Perfect!  Love the flat iron...high quality...great price...good service!  It was shipped very fast!  Brand new!  Love it!  Great hairdressing quality.,5
The subject line is what my wife said the first time she used the iron.  When our toddler accidentally pulled the old name brand iron off the countertop it was time for a replacement.  I wasn't about to pay another $100 for an iron so my wife came across this one on Amazon.  After the first use she was ready to cast her vote for this unit over the name brand.It's only been used for a few weeks so can't gauge whether it will last as long as the previous(which had been going strong a couple years now).  Bottom line is this appears to be a quality iron at around half the price of the name brand.,5
"I was Leary buying this for my daughter over Chi, but it was a great price with great reviews. I have since used it myself and think it's a great product. I would and may buy another for myself!!",5
This is the best flat iron I've ever owned! My sister in law used it over the holidays and now wants one of her own. It seriously is the best product out there for a fraction of what others are.,5
This straightner works just like the one my hair dresser uses. It is great at making curls and the free glove helps me from getting burned fingers. A definite plus! I like the heat adjustment and the light to show it is ready.,5
"I bought this flat iron for my daughter so she would have one of her own to use.  I wanted to get one that would last her more than a year, and this is it.  It heats up very quickly, and she likes that it doesn't catch on her hair.  I think that it is a great value for the quality.",5
"I always buy products that will last a long time. I took a week to do a lot of research on hair straighteners and customer reviews on the product. I couldn't find a single bad review on this straightener and they dated back some time too. I opened the box as soon as it arrived to test it out and I loved it. I've only had it for a week but it is working great so far plus it came with a free satin carrying case, argan oil, and a glove to style your hair with. The plate is curved so you can go for the pin straight look or you can curl the ends. Great purchase and even better price!",5
"I have really thick, curly hair and I straighten it almost daily, and it takes forever-and-a-day to straighten my hair with the store brand flat irons.  And the longer my hair gets, the longer it takes.  So, I did a bunch of research and read the really great reviews on this one and decided to go with it!This 1 iron lets me curl, flip and straighten my hair with ease!  I have never used a flat iron with such ease before. I can't imagine life without this new flat iron!  It came with a little jar of  argan oil leave in conditioner, a storage pouch, and a glove for those hot temps!  (Although I use it on the hottest temp - 410 and didn't need the glove, although it did get extremely hot!)  It leaves my hair shiny and beautiful!I would rate this 5 stars in every category! I am in love with this flat iron, and will never buy a store brand again![...]",5
"Got it for my wife. Nice solid feel, easy to hold and looks expensive. Wife loves it. Makes me look like I know what I'm doing.",5
"I love using this to curl my hair.  The oil that came with is great as well.  Overall I think this is a great product.  I was a little worried since the number of reviews make it seem like it might be fake reviews, but I am really impressed, especially for the price",5
"This flat iron works great! It leaves my hair soft and shiny and it stays styled all day. Also, it heats up so quickly. Just an all around awesome product.",5
Heats really fast! Love how the light turns green when it has reached the desired temp. It was shipped fast also.,5
"I have naturally thick, wavy-curly-frizzy hair.  This iron tames it well, whether I blow-dry first or not.  I like the argan oil that comes with it, and a little goes a long way.  The one-ounce (I think) bottle is still about a quarter full after two months of 1-2 uses weekly.  Between the oil and the iron, my hair comes out sleek and with just enough shine.  I have even been able to style some controlled, loose curls with it. The cord is really long, and the non-plate parts of the iron stay relatively cool even on the highest temperature - I have never burned myself.  Although there is no 'ready' light to indicate that the iron is hot, I'd say it takes less than 5 min. to reach a workable temperature - pretty much, as soon as I try it, it's ready.  I almost never have to go over a strand of hair more than once with this iron (unless it's the next day, after I've slept on it).  Two months and no complaints.  As long as it keeps working this way, I highly recommend it.",5
"I love this straightener.A little about myself: I'm hair challenged. I never learned how to use a curling iron (I can't, for the life of me, understand how people can use those without burning their hands and ears), and I don't even really know how to blow dry and style my bangs. I'm also Asian, with very straight hair that can't usually hold a curl.But this straightener changed everything. In 15 minutes I can create beachy waves. In about 25 minutes I can create tighter curls. And when I just need to smooth out some flyaways or odd creases in my hair, I'm ready to go in under 5 minutes. This straightener heats up in 3-5 minutes, is easy to use (the clamping mechanism isn't so tight that it makes your hand tired from squeezing) and the clamp exterior doesn't get unbearably hot -- meaning, if you accidentally touch it, you won't burn yourself easily. When I'm done styling, I don't even need to use hairspray or other product to keep it in place! By the following day, I still have loose waves. The next-day hair isn't perfect, but it's good for an easy-going, relaxed look.This particular order also comes with a carrying pouch, glove (I don't use it but it's a nice option) and sample-sized bottle of argon oil. It's a generous little package that is well-worth the $50-or-so that I paid for it. And I've tried $100 hair straighteners that yield the same results.Too long; didn't read: Heats up quickly, easy to use, clamp exterior doesn't get TOO hot, very reasonably priced, and your hairdo actually stays the whole day (and then some) without needing hairspray.",5
Product arrived promptly and undamaged. Flat iron performs as described. I like the temperature control feature. Very satisfied with product and would recommend to others.,5
Very fast shipping! I purchased December 27th and received it January 2nd! I LOVEEE this straightener! Leaves my hair straight soft and silky! I had a chi and it stopped working after 6months due to a shortage. This is by far the best straightener I've ever had and its a reasonable price. Comes with a one year warranty as well. Love it. 5 stars !!!,5
"This flat iron left my hair so soft, sleek and straight. It also heats up fast. Only thing is it can pull alittle of your hair but overall it is great and worth the money! I highly recomment it !!",5
Bought this as a gift for my wife.  It showed up on time and my wife loves it.  Says it's the best straightner she has ever used.,5
"This was a christmas gift. Being a guy, I'm clueless about flat irons. I bought this strictly based on reviews, glad I did. Pretty solid, does not feel cheap, girlfriend loves it. I win",5
"I am very pleased with my new flat irons, got them with a great bargain. Item shipped fast. My hair was straight in minutes. I'm also thinking about buying the curlers.",5
"So I'm a 23 year old Caucasian male with fine hair.  I use a flat iron everyday to straighten my hair as I have a Mohawk.  I previously used a Paul Mitchell flat iron which was  so so but nothing special.  Decided to replace the flat iron and stumbled across this one.  This flat iron is AWESOME!!!  My hair is softer, shinier, straighter, easier to style all with less effort.  The iron comes with a very nice carry case so to speak, argon oil sample (amazing as well), and the manual all nicely packaged.  Arrived on time in perfect condition, will DEFINITELY reccommend to others.",5
"I had previously spent upwards of 300$ every couple of months to get my hair chemically straightened, but this produce does allow me to skip that. I can dry my hair on lower heat setting now and still get the frizz out. The flat iron does not catch and pull my hair like others due and leaves it shiny and straight. I just took about 10 minutes for this step after blow drying, and my hair is very thick and long. It's better than the one at my salon.",5
I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she loves it. Just seeing the quality of it has me thinking about getting two more (one for my mother and one for myself). I would definitely recommend this product and look into other products of this brand.,5
This is by far the best flat iron out there. My hair has never been this smooth and silky the heat control is top notch. My daughter and I have been long time users of the other brand that starts with a C. Give this a try and you will be very happy,5
"I purchased this flat iron because I needed a new one, and it looked like a great flat iron for a great price!  And boy is it!  I've been using it for about four weeks now and I love it!  I have naturally curly hair and it makes it straight and shiny!  Love it!",5
"I usually wear my hair curly, and don't do much with it. But my hairstylist straightened my hair after a cut, and it looked so good I had to buy one. This is a really easy size to work with. It makes my hair look so shiny and healthy! I did a lot of research before buying this and read a lot of reviews on different brands and types of straighteners. The tourmaline is supposed to help keep your hair healthy and so far so good. I don't use it everyday, just on special occasions when I want my hair to look sleek and smooth. I use a heat styling spray prior to using this as well.",5
I had been using a budget model straightener and saw this item on sale so I decided to upgrade. Glad I did. Now I know what a real straightener is like. Works great!,4
"Great price, great for any hair type, can use it to curl and straighten. My wife loves this iron she has thick hair and she only has to run the iron through her hair once. Highly recommend all husbands to buy this iron, she will spend less time getting ready to go out!",5
"This is my first flat iron. I have fine straight hair but was unhappy with the result of a ""curling iron"" all the time. I like the straight look, but will a little control of the ends than drying alone. I was worried about a flat iron being too hot, but the product lets you pick your heat and gives some guidance for your hair type. I have only had the product a week, but am very happy with it so far.",5
great product my daughters got these for christmas presents and love them..they can get very hot so I would recommend supervision if for young girls.,5
styler is just like stated or better - i got it for my teenage granddaughter who is biracial - it works wonderful on her hair - leaves it shiny and silky not dried out - very professional,5
"I ordered this product HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch .I was very satisfied with the description prior to buying it.It is a wonderful product and works very well on my thick curly hair.I am able to use it easily and it gives me the results I seek, Shiny Straight hair.I love this product.",5
Bought this for my teen age daughter and she lives it I like how well it's made and the pouch it came with for storage when not in use,5
"Got this for my wife, whose previous one (which was decent) died.  She borrowed one that made it take even longer to get ready, so she was very happy to get this one - It works better (and faster) than both of the previous ones.  I didn't have to go into a salon to figure out which super-expensive model would be worth the price tag, so I'm happy.  This one had the features I was looking for, such as the ceramic plates and the temperature control, and the packaging and extras made it look pretty sharp when she opened it.",5
"My hair is very curly and hard to straighten. The only flat iron that would ever work on it was a Chi, but after reading so many negative reviews and seeing that the HSI was the most purchased product, I decided to go with this one and i'm glad I did! It worked so well! I didn't have to blow dry my hair first either! In the past i've never even owned a flat iron because I had been so disappointed by cheap drug store brands. I would only borrow my friends expensive flat irons or go to a salon. Now i'm glad I have a professional quality one that works, so I can straighten my hair whenever I want!",5
I bought this as a present for my mother and she loves it. It works very well and the price was great.Would recommend to anyone!,5
"Received this Flat Iron, and immediately fell in love with how fast it heat up and how straight it made my sometimes unruly hair.  The straightness lasts for days, and my hair felt soft, shiny and looked extremely healthy.  I also liked the Argan oil I recieved, it helps my hair stay healthy before and after straightening.  I would buy from this seller again, maybe get a curling iron.  I'll definetly purchase the full bottle of Argan Oil.  I must mention I also recieved the glove which helped with the heat on my hands.",5
"I bought this as a christmas gift for a good friend who is also a hairstylist she Liked how it got her hair really straight.She says ""It tames wild/crazy hairs"" Unlike her other ones that she has to go over and over to get them straight.",5
I purchased this hair straightener as a back up and thought I would give it a shot after reading all the great reviews and I was not dissapointed!  I have a chi and I love this one way more than the chi!  Needless to say the chi will be my backup and I will using this as my main one now!,5
"I have very fine hair, but A LOT of it! This flat iron gives me the sleek look that I have been trying to achieve and tames the frizzies.  The iron heats up quickly and does not snag my hair.  The product comes very nicely packaged with a carrying bag for the iron plus a sample of argan oil and the price seems very reasonable!",5
I bought this flat iron for my daughter for Christmas. She wanted a Chi but I read the reviews on the HSI and thought it was a much better buy. My daughter loves the iron and says it is the best one she has used.I am very happy I purchased this through Amazon as I got a heck of a price for a great product!,5
"I checked the reviews, I checked prices and ended up with the HSI  The styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. My daughter has a CHI and we paid twice what I did for the HSI. It works great, I like the temperature control and the product is just easier to use. I would recommend the HSI Flat Iron. A great product and a great value.",5
Perfect for my daughters super thick curls the chi didn't get hot enough to straighten her hair but this flat iron does,5
I have naturally curly hair and have tried several straighteners. This one actually works~!I am the ultimate consumer :).....and finally found a product that delivers....,5
"I LOVE my HSI Flat Iron. I just started using it about two weeks ago. (Merry Christmas to myself!) I haven't had a hair cut since August, but I love my hair now again with my HSI. My friends, family, and coworkers even commented on how nice my hair looks. I usually straightened my hair anyways, but obviously the flat iron I was borrowing before wasn't doing a very good job. Fantastic investment on myself at a great price! Try it, you will not be disappointed.",5
I have thick wavy hair and this straightener makes my locks satiny smooth and shiny.  Will never use another brand!  Love it!,5
This is hands down the best hair straightner I have ever used! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for one!,5
"This is an amazing price for such a great product. This iron works great, has a heat control setting, and you can use it to style your hair straight or curly/beachy waves.",5
"I had the paul Mitchell iron for yrs till it just pooped out on me. I immediately went on amazon to buy the highest rated iron I could find since I have crazy hair that doesn't do a thing with the cheap kind. I was expecting to pay at least $100 for my new one. After reading the reviews on this one I just had to try it,especially since it was so decently priced. Not only does it work better than my last, the grip is very comfortable too!  I can't wait to run out of my morraccan oil so I can start using their oil also since it too has great reviews!",5
I wanted a flat iron that not only flattened but flips and curls too! I bought this product because of the reviews and price. I am so glad I did. I used it to curl my hair and I have to say it works better than a curling iron. I love it!,5
"I purchased this in 2011 after my $150 hair straightener bit the dust. This works so well at a fraction of the cost. It has lasted a long time and gets my super thick/long hair pin straight. With other straighteners, it took me about 1.5 hours to straighten my hair, however, this straightener reduces that time down to 40 minutes. When this one breaks, I will most definitely get it again.",5
"I bought this for my wife and she loves it! I almost bought the infamous CHI for more than twice the price, but glad I didn't. This thing works just as good.",5
"I've been wanting a flat iron for a long time but didn't want to spend an arm and a leg.then I got a gift card from my kids for amazon"" which I love"" by the way so I started looking at flat irons and when I saw the great reviews on this one I thought I'd give it a try and I wasn't disappointed. It's a great flat iron for the price.",5
"I must admit I was a bit skeptical at trying this new product. My hair is so thick, I often find it difficult to find products that work successfully.Great product at an even greater price.",5
This iron is the best iron i have ever had! It makes your hair so smooth and silky and prevents my hair from burning!! Amazing!!,5
I Love this iron! It's very high quality and I would recommend it highly. I have been in the Cosmetology business for many years & this iron performs.,5
"Very skeptical of the amount of reviews and the raving stars. Yet, this is an awesome straightner! I love this straightner, it gives shiny, sleekness and heats up in record time. I'd reccomend this straightner in a heartbeat.",5
"This flat iron is the best! It tames even my wild, thick, frizzy hair into straight , smooth and sleek hair. By far, the best hair styling product purchase I ever made!",5
"Great product,great price,great delivery,everything perfect, Im very happy with it and Im very high recommend this product. Thank you very much.",5
"I figured how could I go wrong with a professional hair straightener for a fraction of its suggested retail? Can't beat it, and with free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime, fantastic!",5
This ceramic straightener leaves hair smooth and straight. It warms up quickly too. We are very happy and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality flat iron.,5
"My wife really likes this hair straightener for its ease of use. It was easy to adjust the temperature and she really likes how evenly it leaves her hair. She tried the HSI Argan Oil sample and likes the soft sheen left behind. When I ordered the HSI Hair Straightener, I seen the full bottle of HSI Argan Oil for sale on Amazon's Web Site but decided to wait until she tried the sample.",4
"I bought this for my wife for Christmas after her Chi nano (2 years old) quit working.She was more than pleased just to have a new iron, but the presentation of the packing of the iron made it all worth while in forgetting the name chi rather quickly.Would recommend to anyone looking for a great buy and great quality!",5
"Nicely built, my daughter loves it. It turns on really quick. It straighten her hair without making it dry and leaving it very shiny.",5
Christmas present for daughter...she loved it!  She told me it is the best product on the market.  Recommend buying this item.,5
"I am not an expert on flat irons, but I think this is a pretty good one compared to the ones I have had in the past (bought at Ulta & Sally Beauty Supply). I like that it has an On and Off switch instead of a button so that I know for sure that it is off when I leave the house. I also like that it came with a fancy looking storage case and a glove so that you don't burn yourself when the flat iron is at it's highest temperature. It is also nice that there is a dial for the temperature ranging from 140 - 410 degrees and a guide telling you which temperature you should use for your hair type. The only negative thing I have to say about this flat iron is that even at 410 degrees, it does not seem to get that hot; although it still flat irons my hair just fine. Maybe that is a good thing that it is not getting hot enough to burn my hair or smoking because it's too hot. All in all, I think this is a good buy if you can get it on sale. I would not pay full price for it.",4
The straightener was even better than I anticipated. Down side is my daughter keeps taking it from me! May have to get another one! My hair feels like I just got out of the salon.,5
"I have been very satisfied with this straightener! I bought this as a replacement for an older flat iron, which took forever to straighten my hair and didn't get as hot. This heats up very quickly and works great at straightening my hair. I love the adjustable temperature feature. It leaves my hair shiny and sleek. I would buy this straightener again if I needed a replacement. Definitely worth the money.",5
This is a good flat iron but its not a chi. If you want a real chi the buy one. If you're looking for a decent flat iron the try this one.,4
"I bought Tourmaline flat iron for my daughter in law for Christmas and they were on sale so I bought me one too. I couldn't believe the price. When I used it for the first time, my husband even noticed the difference. I was amazed how it made my hair feel as well as look. My daughter in law loves it as well. She's the one who made me get it in the first place. I would definitely recommend it above any flat irons I've ever owned and I purchased it at the right time.",5
"I purchased this after reading all of the great reviews. I think that no matter what straightener you get you're going to have to replace it after awhile. I think they just loose their heat. This works great though, made my hair super straight and smooth.",5
"This is awesome! Makes my hair super straight and leaves it feeling soft, not dried out :) I would definitely recommend.",5
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! Great product for an even better price!,5
I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it! It works fast and she loved the oil it came with.,5
"It heats up quickly and cools down quickly. Swivel cord and length is great. Use it to straight, curls, or flip for body. My hair looks good!!! Sweet red silk carry case too.",5
"I bought two of these for each of my teenage daughters. They are mixed and have thick, unruly hair. Both loved the straightener, even more then their Chi. I may have to buy one for myself. I have seen these in the mall for $200, so this is a great price.",5
"I bought into all the great reviews and purchased it. It kept catching my GF's hair and ripping it out.  The ceramic plates weren't as smooth as her nearly broken down Chi (which this was intended to replace).  We returned it and got a very fast reply/refund.  Great service, product wasn't as good as we thought.Gonna go and buy a new Chi instead...",3
"I purchased this flat Iron for my 17 year old daughter as a Christmas present.  She has had irons in the past and been ok with them.  She was very excited about this iron, as it leaves her hair smooth and shiny! She has very thin and fine hair which damages easily and most irons tend to dry it out and make it look frizzy.  This one made her hair look sleek and shiny.  It is an amazing deal and very well constructed.  Much better quality then the store models that cost more.",5
"I had not heard of this brand of straightener and took a chance! - I was not disapointed.  The straightener has variable heat settings and can get really hot, which is what I need for my long very thick hair.  The price was attractive, but this straightener is every bit as good or better than the expensive ones!",5
"I bought this straightener for my 17 yr old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  Says it makes her hair feel soft and shiny, not fried or frizzy at all.  She would highly recommend this product.",5
"I bougth this Iron for my daugther i Love it is perfect I do my daugther's hair every morning before school. thank you ,",5
I absolutely love this flat iron! I had an infrashine before and I was skeptical of switching but this was a great choice. it takes a little longer to heat up but it is worth that wait.,5
I had been a Chi fan for about 8 years now.... until my Chi finally gave up on me.  I was really iffy about going into a new name brand BUT I took the plunge and ecstatic that I did! I am hispanic with thick curly hair and this flat iron worked better than the Chi! And for the price? Who can go wrong? :),5
"I have a straightener that I love but wanted one with rounded edges to use for curling my hair. It works great for that and I can curl my hair in  half the time it takes using my curling iron. I actually haven't used it to straighten my hair. My only complaint would be that it doesn't have an auto shut-off like my other straightener so I have to make sure I turn it off, no big deal.",5
"I loved the package it came in, the argon oil smells really good compared to others that I've used before.",4
"My daughter loves this straightener - no loose plates to catch her hair and it only takes one pass to straighten her hair.  An added bonus is how easy it is to curl hair.  The swivel cord actually works, no worries about a twisted, tangled cord.  The adjustable heat setting and user-friendly handle design are also appreciated.  I would recommend this straightener to anyone looking at a Chi, save yourself the extra money.",5
My daughter and I love it. I doesn't burn your hair like the one we had and the hair feels nice and silky. It takes a little bit to warm up but just plug it ahead of time. We are happy with it.,5
"This is a great product, compact, love the clove that comes with the item, and it just works, also the price was amazing. thank you amazon.",5
i bought this flat iron because of the reviews it had and they where right its a  great flat iron and i droped it a couple of times and it didnt break like other flat irons that break esaly i really recomend this flat iron,5
Bought this for my 17 yo daughter but I think I use it more then she does. Works well and doesn't fry the hair.,4
"I researched many flatirons before I decided to purchase this one. I'm very satisfied thus far. I am biracial and do not have Caucasian hair. My hair is naturally wavy, yet coarse. As such, I need an iron that can get to my roots and make them bone-straight...and that is just what this iron does. It takes me only a couple of passes per section, and it leaves my hair silky. I love it!A couple of things to point out: I read some reviews where people stated it did not work because it didn't get hot enough when they plugged it in and switched iit on. That happened to me too, and I nearly flipped out, but if you press in the red reset button on the plug, the heat will then come forth.One teeny tiny complaint, but not big enough for me to dock it a whole star...the criss-cross pattern on the iron where your fingers will be primarily grasping it, can get slightly uncomfortable.  Because of the length and thickness of my hair, it takes me about an hour to completely straighten. Some other people may not have to use it that long so it might not be a problem. I started using the glove it came with, which I know is a heat protector for your hand, but hey, two birds, one stone.  The glove helped eliminate that.The little argon oil sample they sent is not bad. I used it on my ends at night before I wrap my hair. In the morning my hair feels great and looks healthy.It is the best iron for the money.",5
Bought this for my 23 y o daughter for Christmas.  She had an inexpensive one that she didn't like very much.  She loves this one and has been using it everyday.  Heats up quickly and gets very hot.  Hair appears shinier as well.,5
"I GOT THIS FLAT IRON FOR MY DAUGHTER B/C I GOT TIRED OF HER USING MINE AND NOT BRINGING IT BACK. THIS IS A GREAT FLAT IRON FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED, I PAID ALMOST $200 BUCKS FOR THE ONE I HAVE, AND GOT THIS ONE AND IT WORKS JUST AS WELL ON MY HAIR AND GOT IT FOR LIKE $40 BUCKS",5
I returned this product because it is not the same I ordered . I do not know if it is ok or not .,3
"I absolutley love this flat iron!!! It heats up very quickly, glides smoothly, doesn't sizzle my hair and gives me perfect curls. The ceramic plates are set away from the edge enough that you don't burn your forehead when straightening your bangs, nor does it heat up the bathroom countertop like my old flat iron.I had two CHI's previously and both died within 12 months of buying them. The Corioliss flat iron I had after the CHIs was great, but got very hot on the outside and if you weren't careful about where you picked it up/ placed your fingers, would burn you badly. So far, this is the best flat iron I've ever had!",5
"My wife loves the product.  She tried one at Costco first and was not impressed.  She used yours and has no complaints,  It does not damage her hair,  And is easy to use.  Good quality item,  All I can say is if my wife's happy,  I'm happy!  Thanks!!!!!",5
"I really like this flat iron, especially in comparison to my previous one.  It is pretty heavy and works very well on my fairly thin, fine hair.  It does a great job smoothing my naturally wavy hair.",4
"My wife wanted a new flat iron for Christmas. She had another brand and thought a different styler was what she wanted. After looking at other products and reviews, I settled on the HSI, not the one she originally requested. Ordered through Blue Novelties through Amazon a few days before Christmas. It arrived in one day. It was on sale and a great value. Found after I purchased it, it was number 1 rated styler on Amazon. The product was nicely packaged. My wife was impressed with the professional look and feel of the styler. She was totally and pleasantly surprised to also find the protective glove, travel pouch, and sample oil. She just used it today, day after Christmas. She loved the way it slides easily through her hair. Just getting used to it, so cannot offer comment on specifics of operation or durability, but first impression - ecstatic! Couldn't wait to tell me about it. Would highly recommend this product!",5
I bought this flat iron on a lightning deal so I got a great price for it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the nice pouch it came to store it.  It is lightweight and very easy to use.  I have curly hair and it straigtened very quickly.  I def will recommend it to friends.,5
Purchased as a gift for my wife. She opened the gift and immediately knew the brand and was extremely happy! Ran upstairs to wash her hair just so she could use it.,4
"Works great on my longer hair, it turned out smooth and straight! Would recommend it to anyone looking for a straightner that gives professional results to thicker, curly hair.",5
This was the only flat iron that specified its working temp range.  My hairdresser suggested using a low temp 145 F on my hair  Most irons stated their max temp which did not help me. The HSI iron came beautifully packaged including a thick insulated storage bag and a protective glove.,5
"""I used to use the CHI, but after seeing the ratings on this, I had to try it. My hair is super course, thick, curly..just really un-tamable, this straightener works AMAZING it takes me about 2-3 hours with a normal straightener, bout an hour with the chi, and about 20-30 mins with the HSI, I LOVE IT!""updated: five months after purchase:About a month ago my iron stopped getting so hot, now when I use it my hair does not stay straight.....its back to my old straightener I guess",3
"I have really difficult hair (the front is straight and the back is wavy and the middle is all kinds of crazy) and living in south Louisiana doesn't help with the humidity and all that. I have found that only my Paul Mitchel flat iron will keep my hair really straight and prevent frizzing, but it doesn't curl my hair. I have only had my HSI for a few days, and I've only used it to curl my hair, but so far I love it!! The curls stay all day without using hairspray and my hair doesn't frizz. I've also used the sample argan oil that comes with the flat iron and I'm not as crazy about it as some of the other reviewers. I don't find it does much for my hair. I've tried using a small amount and a larger amount and I haven't seen a difference in the HSI argan oil vs other silky oils like biosilk. The only negative to my HSI flat iron is that it doesn't glide as smoothly through my hair as my Paul Mitchel does. Overall, I LOVE my new HSI, and it was money well spent.",5
"This item was given as a gift.  I had been told the existing straightener my gf had was not hot enough.  I found this product, which was priced brilliantly, had great reviews, and fit the criteria of what I was seeking.  The gift was given yesterday morning and used within an hour.  The feedback?  ""The flat iron is FABULOUS!!!  I LOVE IT!!!  It is perfect, and does exactly what I have been hoping for.""  I can't say anything bad about the product, nor the service.  All was/is excellent!",5
"I read many of the reviews for this flat iron, as well as others before purchasing. The control for this is on the inside of the iron. But this is not a problem at all. It is easy to turn off and on and unlike other flat irons, I am not constantly hitting the on/off button. Also people reported that the iron was hot to the touch and it made their hands hot. I have not experienced this at all. The flat iron works magic for my hair, leaving it silky and shiney. It also straightens but gives body as well. I would never purchase any other brand of flat iron!!!",5
"Only used it once so far, but it does what it is advertised to do.  Can't complain.  I'd like to see how long it lasts though.  My old Chi's always lasted several years.  I have high hopes for this one.  :)",4
"I have purchased several expensive flat irons for my daughter and she is really pleased with how the 'HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch' compares to the Paul Mitchell and Chi that she has used.",5
I purchased this flat iron hair straightener for my daughter for a Christmas.  She was extremely happy with her gift.  She has used hair straighteners in the past and she was very happy with her gift.The styler ceramic straightener was delivered as promised in excellent condition.  It also was in a very nice cloth pouch making it easier for travel.  I would recommend purchasing this product from this Amazon seller Blue Novelties.,5
i droped my royale in the toilet. -.- so i bought this as a temp replacement. now its a permanent replacement,5
"This is a great straightener! It straightens and curls very well. The only reason it is deducted a star, is because sometimes my hair get stuck. Sometimes. people make straightener where the plates kinda compresses when you straighten(or curls your hair) and your hair gets caught.. I wanted a hair straighter that wouldn't get caught in my hair, since my hair is fine. MY hair got stuck a few times, which defeats the purpose of me spending several hours looking at reviews.... But there is a tactic I used so my hair doesn't get stuck... So it isn't that bad. It has a dial so that you can change the temperature of it, for different hair style.But it does come with a lot of fun stuff. Like a glove, a red hair straightener bag and a trial size of oil for your hair to protect it from damage. So lots of fun goodies to look forward to!",4
"I absolutely love this hair straightener! I have the chi, and I like this hair straightener so much more. It also came with this small sample of argon oil that worked miracles for my hair! The argon oil makes me feel like I have model hair LOL But this hair straightener works really well as a curling iron too! It takes around a minute to heat up. The bottom line is that I really like this product, and I would recommend this product to a friend or maybe even give it as a gift to someone.",5
"Wow! I love this flat iron. It's amazing! I have always had such a hard time straightening my long, thick, wavy hair.  I have tried several different flat irons and have always wanted a Chi so this year I decided to spend the money on one and then I came across the HSI flat iron on Amazon and after reading the reviews and seeing the low price, I figured how can I go wrong? If it sucks, I am only out $40 but it doesn't suck.  In fact, it's amazing.  My hair look so straight and it did not take that long to achieve the look. It grips very tight so the hair stays in place and straightens well.  Also, I did not have to put it to the highest temp but I did put it almost to the hottest.  This is the best flat iron I have ever owned and I am very satisfied with my purchase.",5
My gf was complaining about how she hated her hair straightener to her friend. I over heard the convo and decided to hunt for one for Xmas. I got this one and she can't stop raving about how great it is. How well it works. How shiny it makes her hair. Now  the best bd ever! Thanks.,5
This flat iron is one of the best. I paid $160 for mine last year and then found it for $40 this year for my daughter in-law!,5
"I've been using the inStyler, you know the flat iron with a roller. Very nice, but I've gone through 2 and decided to go for a ceramic flat iron for my long long hair. This is terrific. It's my first ionic straightener and it leaves my hair smooth and pretty. Be sure to use the argon oil if you're hair tends to be dry or you're using color. I ordered the argon oil from Camden-Grey.com and got a lot for a little - pure and it's really good for skin, so I use it in place of moisturizer, too.",5
"Ordered the HSI Flat Iron on Friday and received it on the following Monday.  Was packed well with no dents or dings.  Upon opening the box found not only the flat iron but a bag to store it in, a glove to handle when it is hot along with a sample bottle of oil to try on your hair.  Plugged it it heated up quickly and evenly.  My hair came out smoothly and soft without a lot of work.  Wonderful product would recommend it to anyone from the easiest to manage to the hardest hair to manage.",5
Great affordable product. No need to spend hundreds of dollars on a straightener anymore. Also I really like the glove,5
Wife tried it with great results. She was apprehensive earlier with doing it herself (usually gets in done in salon). But this gives salon results and in 2 uses pays for itself.Temperature control is great. The glove and the carry bag are wonderful extras.,5
"Read great reviews on this item and decided to try it rather than a Chi and other ""professional,"" over priced straighteners. The results are fantastic. My wife can tell a difference between the tourmaline and basic ceramic plates. It feels healthier and less frizzy. The floating plates are also a great feature to ensure even heating. Although simple, the swivel cord is really nice to have too. Comes in a nice package including sleeve, glove, and oil.  The adjustable heating knob is perfect for all types of hair to get the best, customized experience not at the expense of your hair. Would buy again and recommend to others. Very satisfied with this product.",5
"Easy to use. Does a great job.  Coes with the hot glove, too.  Can't believe I got this at such an amazing price!",5
I found out about this flat iron through one of my friends. She has the same one. I fell INLOVE with it. Shipping was quick too. most deff would recommend :) I tried many irons. This one is at the top along with Chi.,5
Excellent product and great price!!!  I have super thick hair And this went through my hair smoothly and just one time was enough!! Highly recommended,5
"My previous straightener was a cheap model from a big box store.  My mom had a CHI straightener that was fantastic.  After realizing how bad mine was.  (I was satisfied, until I tried the CHI).  I purchased this one on a lightening deal, or deal of the day on impulse.I'm completely satisfied.  It works just as well as my mom's $150 CHI straightener.  I don't know why I didn't upgrade sooner!  It heats up immediately and leaves my hair silky smooth!  I don't use it too often. Maybe I'll update the review after I've used it more regularly and for a longer time.  But currently I can say it is completely comparable to my mom's expensive CHI.Update: I've been using it regularly for a while now and could not be more impressed.  The quality is certainly equal to the more expensive straighteners I've used.  Awesome!",5
3 stars for now on this item.  It arrived and was immediately wrapped for Xmas.  Upon opening my wife found the small bottle of oil had leaked over everything!!  Needles to say she and I were quite upset over this.  I will report back after she tries it.,3
this is a fantastic straightner for a fantastic price!  i would definately buy this straightner again!!  it works just as well as one that i bought for $150.00 at a beauty supply store.,5
"This is something our daughter in law REALLY wanted! I think she will be SO happy with it, too! Great price & very speedy delivery!",5
This flat iron works wonders on my spiral curls!  In no time flat I have straight shiny hair.  You can tell this is a professional flat iron.,5
"I bought the HSI ceramic straightener as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is always complaining about how hard it is to get her hair straight. She has bought a couple of the more popular, high end ceramic irons with marginal success. We had a Christmas party to go to so I let her have the HSI iron as an early gift and I must say, she loves it! I'm not an expert on what makes one iron work better than another but she said the HSI was much more gentle on her hair and left if soft and straight! So thank you, because if she's happy, I'm happy.",5
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  I have aChi and this flat iron works just as well as my Chi.,5
"I bought this one several weeks ago and i love it. It's not like those plastic flat iron, it has high quality. Make sure your hair is dry before you use it. And put some anti frizz oil on it(there is a small bottle of oil come with this product in the box). And then you will find out your hair is not only straight but shining, smoothy, and especially natural. And it has a glove in the box either. I really love this flat iron and i will recommend it to my friend.",5
Works very well to straighten or curl hair. I like the shiny hair I get with this flat iron. Works quickly and has adjustable heat settings.,5
"The professional packaging let you have the sleek iron in an elegant silk pouch that comes very handy for storage. There is an indispensable heat protectant glove that I always coveted my stylist for having. It makes a decent job in keeping my fingers safe from burning. The HTI professional flat iron is truly a life saver. The ceramic blades turns my dry hair into softer locks that are frizz free. It has simple buttons that cant get you confused and the grip is perfect to prevent slipping. The light is very handy turning between red when its warming up to green when its ready. It heats up to medium temperature in less than a minute. Your last surprise is the argan oil sample they threw in with the flat iron. This is a true miracle. If you have textured hair or a dry one, this si a must. It softens, detangles and defrizz hair in seconds. The good part is the effect will last for 1-2 days, unlike other products which effect wears off in an hour or two. The oil looks viscous but once you rub a dime size drop in your hand, it runs so light and never weigh your hair.Great product, GREAT packaging!",5
Really happy with this purchase. Switched from a chi since mine died on me and am very happy with the quality of the product. Gets hot pretty quickly and I think it does a great job straightening my hair. The price is also awesome! Would definitely recommend. I have thin/medium hair that usually gets frizzy/wavy on its own.,5
This was a gift and my daughter in law loves it as it gives her the results she wants just like when she leaves the hairdressers.  The ones you can buy in the department store just don't give you the professional results.  I have one happy daughter in law because of this product.,5
I've purchased two chi straighteners in the past few years. I decided to try this for half the cost and I am just as pleased if not happier. I love being able to control the temperature. The styler feels very sturdy. High quality for a very fair cost.,5
I am so happy with my new flat iron!! I bought it bc it was a good deal and had good reviews. I was amazed when I got it that it was much better then the Chi I had used in the past!! This flat iron is the best I've owned! It's an awesome deal and the flat iron is WONDERFUL!! Highly recommend!!! I love it!!,5
The adjustable heat setting is beneficial. Straightening my hair is must faster than flat iron I had without the heat adjustment. I actually enjoy straightening my hair now. Can't beat the value for this price.,5
"I really love this flat iron. It makes my naturally curly hair straight and smooth. In addition, the sale price of this flat iron is amazing. I highly recommend this flat iron.",5
"I have had a Chi hair straightener for 6 years and it has worked great, but was starting to get old and the plates were not aligning correctly anymore. I was afraid I would never find anything comparable to the Chi and I was soooo wrong!! This straightener performs better, has a thicker grip which I personally find makes it easier to control and my hair doesn't feel as dry and limp when I am done. I have very unruly,curly, frizzy hair and this straightener works magic on it.",5
We love this flat iron!  My daughter has wavy hair and I have very curly dyed hair.  It works great on both of us.  We are very pleased with it.  I was surprised how well it worked on my hair.  Anyone with naturally curly dyed hair knows how hard it is to straighten it and it look good.  This iron is great :o),5
Very satisfied with my HSI flat iron - would recommend to a friend.  The product does not feel light-weight and cheap yet it is not heavy or cumbersome to use.,5
My girlfriend is extremely picky about hair straighteners so I was pretty nervous picking one out for her after her paul mitchell one was lost somehow going through airport security. She absolutely loves this straightener and won't stop telling me how great it is. Highly recommend this product!,5
"This flat iron is super. You can control the heat setting to your preference and that makes a huge difference for those of us with thicker curlier hair types. It works effortlessly and heats up fast. My hair is done in under ten minutes. I have shoulder length hair, by the way. It costs less than the Chi and in my opinion works better. I returned the Chi to try this and I am much happier with HSI.",5
"I just received my flat iron so this review is based on only 2 uses.  So far, I like it.  My hair glides smoothly through the flat iron and it straightens my hair nicely.  I did find that my hair sometimes gets snagged like some other reviews said, but I'll probably need a little more time to get used to the straightener.  I would have liked it better if the heating elements were longer so I can grab more hair at one time.  (I have a lot of hair!)  Also, the on/off switch and temperature control settings are inconveniently placed on the inside of the straightener, so if you have big hands/fat fingers, it's kind of awkward to adjust the settings.",4
product arrived as expected.  so farm I have been very pleased with this product. It by far is one of the best flat irons I have had experience with.  I would recommend this to all.,5
"My mother had been wanting a flat iron for a while. She has very long and wavy hair, which is on the coarse side. After reading all the great reviews on this flat iron, I decided to purchase it. My mom is very happy with this! In addition to the heat shield spray for her hair, this flat iron makes her hair very shiny and soft. It heats up very quickly, and gets her thick hair straight in a short amount of time. Highly recommended.",5
I loved it.Great price for a wonderful product.  It's easy to work with and heats up in now time at all.,5
i have curly hair and this straightener is good with straightening for the most part but with the high heat settings i feel like it is way too hyped up because it isn't that much like a professional styling tool but it still gets the job done,4
First of all let me say I purchased this iron on sale for $43 & free shipping. I've never spent over $40 on a flat iron .... so I'm not sure how the really expensive irons compare. Even though this iron retails for $300. I still prefer my flat iron I purchased from Sally's beauty supply. I do like the design & it fits comfortably in my hand.The iron DOESN'T seem to reach MAX TEMP & pulls my hair. I have fine/thin hair.I wouldn't purchase it again.,3
"I was searching for a flat iron that would be effective without draining my pocketbook. But it had to be a quality product because I have tried many $20 flat irons that were almost useless. This product fit the bill! Not only does it work great, but it also comes with a carrying pouch which will be perfect for travel. It takes very little time to heat up and seems to be quite sturdy.",5
"I am impressed with this straightener.  I originally bought a CHI on sale for $100 down from $200??? I took it back, it wasn't hot enough.  The HSI straightener reaches temperature, leaves my hair sleek and shiny.  It comes with a beautiful pouch and argan oil which leaves your hair even nicer. Thumbs up!",5
"I have had a CHI for four years, which I paid $120 for... well it recently died on me and I had to replace it quickly. I had a ""back up"" cheapy one by Conair, but it was pathetic. So, I found a great deal for this one just before Christmas, and bought it for myself. I couldn't be happier, it works as well as the CHI for a fraction of the price. It heats up quickly and doesn't fry my long hair. I would recommend this to anyone with fine-medium hair types.",5
"I used to own a GHD flatiron but gave it to my mom and bought this one based on all the glorious reviews.  HSI flatiron is NOT as great as people make it out to be.  It does ok for the money, but really, you get what you paid for.  I should've know that.  Perhaps I'm biased since my expectation was where my $200 GHD flatiron was and wanted this $50 to perform just as good, but I was truly disappointed when it took twice as long to flatiron my hair and curled hair didn't last half a day.  I wouldn't recommend this product to others unless you are looking for something mediocre.",2
I have went through a few hair straightener in my time. I have very long curly hair that Id rather have straight. This straightener is by far the best I've used. It gets very hot and that's a plus because it means faster straightening time. It also has the heat daily on inside of handles so you don't accidentally turn heat down as your hands on handle. I love heat dial is on inside between handles because I've turned down heat on a few straighteners before when it's on outside of handles. This straightener heats up fast stays hot and my hair looks like silk when  I'm done. I love this product! I'd recommend this straightener to everyone who's looking to buy one.,5
"This flat iron is a replacement to a 1"" Chi I bought five years ago.  This flat iron does the job well!I'm a newcomer to the temperature control, but it is nice to have that option for different strengths. The iron heats up quickly and has a nice indicator button to let you know when it is or is not ready for action. I love the criss-cross pattern that is etched on the outside because it makes for a great grip that my last flat iron definitely did not have! The cord is very long; too long for my needs, but a great option.This particular item also came with argon oil, which I have not yet tried as well as a fabric pouch the iron goes in and a fabric glove, which all makes this a great gift option.This flat iron has turned out to be a wonderful replacement for my Chi flat iron. I would buy another product from this company in the future.",5
"I just received this a few days ago so I have only used it a couple times but it does heat up very quickly and seems very smooth gliding over my hair. I am still adjusting to the 1"" size because my old one was 1 1/2"" but I think I will take a liking to it well. I do like that the cord on it swivels as my last one was having issues because of the way I wrapped the cord but this one that can't happen to because it does swivel. All in all it was definitely worth $50 and the seller shipped very quickly. I gave it 4 stars due to not having used it but a couple of times.",4
"I just received the HSI Flat Iron and I really like it a lot.  It works like a professional quality product but at a VERY reasonable price. My hair looked softer and silklier right away, it certainly tamed the ""frizzes"". This Iron gets an A+++ from me...",5
"I have purchased SEVERAL CHI brand Flat Irons which have all failed miserably. I bought them around once a year if not less, because my wife kept complaining about how they eventually wore out and stopped working. Being that this HSI Flat Iron was 1/3 of the price I've been paying, and I haven't heard a single complaint yet I am more than happy with this purchase. While this review is geared more towards someone buying this as a gift for their wife/gf/daughter etc. I hope my experience alone will help anyone make this purchase!",5
I have used this straightner and it came as promised on time.  The packaging was perfect. I kept it for myself but would have been pleased to give or receive as a gift.  Thanks.,5
"Great product for a fantastic price.  I usually have straighteners on the highest setting, even with Argan Oil, however I only had to have the HSI straightners on half way.  Easier to use and straighen faster and smoother than others I have paid 3X as much for.",5
"I was a little uncertain ordering a hair straightener online, but I decided to go for it.  This straightener is a great price and it works really well.  I have wavy/frizzy hair and this smooths it out really well and doesn't make it look fried.  So far I'm very pleased!",5
I have never been one that spends too much time on my hair but I got a style that kinda requires it so I found this & ever since I love every bit of it. Its easy & fast & that what a mother of 3 needs.,5
"These irons heat up really quickly, they also have a dial to set the desired temperature.  They are light and easy to use.  I have short hair and the first day I used them, around 10 people commented on how great my hair looked that day :)",5
"I had been considering WAY more expensive flat irons -- my hair is thick and it is long so I have tried several brands of flat irons and have not been happy with many of them.  The very first time I used this flat iron, I had more compliments on my hair than I have had in a long time!The included glove to help protect your hand against burns, the box it comes in, the silky pouch to keep it in...all were extras that made me feel like I got a STEAL on this flat iron!",5
I've used a Chi for a long time.  I noticed it didn't work as well as the salon flat irons.  So I decided to get a new one and came cross the HSI.  I read all the great reviews so I decided to order it.  I love it!,5
"What an amazing flat iron at an equally amazing price, plus it came with argan oil and a glove to use. This flat iron truly compares to the $200+ models found out there, it smoothed my hair in minutes and when I was done (like 3 minutes total for long brown hair, it looked like I just had a professional blowout. I went out to dinner that night and received comments on how my hair looked so health and full! I am so please with this purchase, I highly recommend it!!!",5
"I just got this straightener. It's my first flat iron purchase, so I thought I'd start with something like this that isn't too expensive. It heats up quickly and the extra accessories are nice (glove, oil, nice red satin carrying pouch).I have only used it once (and in a hurry) but I don't have my straightening technique down yet, so I will have to try again. Seems like a good purchase though.",5
"I was just looking for a gift just for christmas and i found this item at such a lower price at the beginning i thought it might not be a good one because of their price but it ended being a really good one. My mom it's in love with this iron, she defenately its happy with the result of using it. I will spread the word so other people can order this item. Btw it was a really fast shipping. Great !!!",5
"I recently purchased this flat iron after my salon flat iron died.  I am very happy with the performance of this flat iron.  I had tried an off the shelf revlon model that never got hot enough and never worked for me.  This iron does a great job, heats up quickly and handles great.  I highly recommend this product!",5
"My hair is relatively thick, and is wavy, bordering on curly. Some days it's curly, some days it's just wavy. This straightener warms up fast, and straightens my hair fast. It also leaves my hair smooth and soft, unlike my previous straightener that left a rough texture and some frizz. I use this at least once a week, and before when my hair would take about an hour to straighten, this one only takes about 20 minutes, and that's only if I'm sitting down and actually doing it carefully.",5
"I have only used this product once since getting it but it appears to be of good quality. I have been wanting to get myself a nice decent straightener for some time now and saw the HSI (The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch)on one of my blog websites as a a good deal so I ordered it. I have thick primarily straight hair but I wanted to be able to get it real straight once in a while. This product seems to be perfect for the job. Comes in a timely manor and in store packaging. I would recommend. In addition this seller has contacted me several times to make sure everything is good (which shows they care about a good reputation!)",5
This product was a gift for my mother in law.. She seems to be very pleased and as well as I because I saved alot of money.,4
I was very happy when I received my HSI Ionic Flat Iron one day earlier than was told. You will not be disappointed. I love it. It makes you hair smooth and it glides as you use it. I would highly recommend this item. The price was awesome and the product is even better. I would like to buy a second one just to have on hand. You will love it. I never could afford the CHI's everyone talks about. Or could not see spending that much on an iron. Buy this!! You will not regret it. It comes with a nice satin bag for traveling and a glove and sample of Argon oil that will make your hair shine. Love it and the company I purchased it from. Great delivery and service. As Nike says... Just Do It.,5
"I am IN LOVE with this straightener!! I have very coarse, curly, thick hair (think horse mane, only thicker!) and I was amazed at how well this took the curl out. It heats up quickly and it maintains its heat until I shut it off. It can flip my hair under or out or make it stick straight. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an auto shut off, but it is a salon styler so I assume that's why. So I just have to remember to unplug it. Other than that, I have zero complaints. It really gets the job done and holds the style until I wash my hair again!",5
I went to a mall last week and was really impressed by the ISO flat iron only to find out it was $300.00! I was disgusted at this price and decided to look on Amazon.com to see if I could find a more reasonable flat iron. Well I did and am completely happy with my purchase. I read several reviews about the HSI iron and was very skeptical at first but decided to try it out. I had never heard of this brand. Not only does it work amazing but I don't have to use several products that weigh your hair down in the process. I just let my naturally thick hair dry and then flat iron it. I have shoulder length hair and am able to straighten in about 10 minutes and it looks as good as Jennifer Anniston's!! Well I 100% percent recommend this flat iron if you want an amazing flat iron for a minimal cost. -Kristina,5
"My Chi iron broke and I got this one to replace it. I had the Chi for a number of years but it was a top rated product when purchased and it held up wonderfully. This iron, which was soooo much cheaper is just as good and soooo much more affordable! I liked it so much that I got this one from this seller as a CHristmas present for my friend who has naturally curly hair (Mines is thick and frizzy). The seller ships super fast and the product came in perfect condition. You can't go wrong at this price!",5
This flat iron was easy to use. I feel that it is presented well and the bag to keep it safe is cute as well! I would recommend the HSI flat iron.,5
All women want a curling iron... BUT they all want that expensive one that most men just can't seem to understand the high price for.  She'll never mention it to you because even she can't justify the cost.  It doesn't make phone calls.  You can't surf the web with it.  It doesn't play music.  BUT...  it will quite possibly be her most favorite electronic item.  Nothing on the market geared for males will do what this product does.  It saves her time.  It gives her confidence.  It'll make her more spontaneous.  And she'll love you so much more because you surprised her by thinking outside of the jewelry box!  Take it from someone who knows!,5
"I love this straightener!  I was a little worried because the price was so much lower than the other big name brands. But the reviews we all o good I thought I would try it.  It does a great job on my hair.  Easy grip, smooth plates, and it gets very hot!  The glove is an extra bonus because my hair gets too hot to touch when on high.",5
This product is awesome. It heats up in less than 30 seconds and it also makes your hair shine! I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone!,5
"I've never had a high-end straightener like some of the other girls, so I don't have those to compare the HSI to. But I have spent this kind of money on straighteners in the past, and none of them have ever performed like this.I have thin, relatively straight hair. My problem is that my hair can be fairly frizzy and looks ""weightless"", if you can imagine. The difference that a good quality straightener can make--my hair becomes glossy and looks/feels much healthier. The frizziness is noticeably reduced and my hair seems to have more texture.In terms of the straightener itself, it heats up very fast. The size is perfect for me and I have hair that falls just at my shoulders (hair in the back is at the base of my neck, hair in the front is slightly longer.)Basically, you're getting a professional straightener (I say professional because it gives me the same results that my hair dresser's straightener does), for a very very good price. I would definitely recommend this one. Plus it seems like if you do get a broken one by fluke, their customer service is great.",5
I did not use it yet but the style and other things looks grate. I think you can buy it,5
"I recently moved and found myself without my normal straightener. I turned to Amazon and was very happy with this find. The straightener works great, and came with a free bottle of argan oil which makes my hair INCREDIBLE soft. Even comes with a styling glove if you're prone to burning yourself (like me). Works well for straightening and curling. I was planning on going back to my old straightener brand since this one was intended to be a stopgap, but I'm going to stick to this one. Would recommend.",5
works like a charm! would recommend for straigtening use ANYDAY! the box is even pretty looking and makes a great gift. very happy with this product.,5
"The HSI is a great straightener. It makes your hair unbelievably soft and smooth, and straightens those unmanageable spots too. I love the fact that it can also curl and flip your hair as well, and has a wide range of settings, from low to very very hot.",5
"Best iron I've had! My hair is super curly and it used to take me over an hour to straighten it. Now I've got it down to about a half an hour and it is way smoother than I've ever had it! It makes very pretty soft curls too. For the price I couldn't have asked for more, I would pay more for this quality but luckily I didn't have to! :)",5
"Extrememly happy with the performance of this flat iron.  It's high quality construction, heats evenly and great results every time.",5
I purchased this item and had expressed shipped to use for my company's Holiday Party. The flat iron worked very well and heats up fast! The heat control is easy to change and I like that it has an indicator light to know when it is hot. I love all the extras that came with it and I would recommend it to anyone. I have very thick hair and it straightened my hair very well!,5
"THIS HSI FLAT IRON WORKS GREAT ESPCIALLY FOR THE PRICE I WAS LOOKING FOR ... THEY EVEN OFFRED TO SEND ME A FREE OIL FOR THE FLAT IRON.  MY GIRL FRIEND LOVES IT ... IT DOESNT TKE LONG TO HEAT UP AND IS SAFE BECAUSE WE HAVE KIDS... I SUGGEST ANYONE WHO WANTS AN AFFORDABLE FLAT IRON THAT DOES THE TRICK , AND NOT HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS SHOULD CONSIDER THIS HSI STRAIGHTENER.",5
"I was looking for a flat iron and really did not want to spend a lot. I saw this had great reviews and thought it was worth the buy. I am very happy with this purchase, it did a great job straitening my hair.",5
This straightener is really great. I have very thick hair and a little worried about how well it would work but Im very impressed. Im buying one for my daughter and would recommend it to anyone.,5
"This straightener aims to please! I have thick, frizzy hair and my previous straightener just didn't do its job...this one does easily! It doesn't take forever for me to straighten my hair.Comes with adjustable temperature control, and the smooth plates and design of this flat iron is great so I'm not pulling out my hair.And really, you seriously can't beat the price!Shipment was smooth and quick!Thank you!",5
"This product met and exceeded my expectations. I bought as a gift for my daughter, she loves it!!! I will be purchasing one for myself shortly. Great product at a great price!!!HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch",5
"I and my daughters all have very long, curly hair...kinky/frizzy that is very hard to straighten, most products do not work. I was looking for an affordable ceramic straightener that would not ""fry"" my hair. This worked so great my daughter took mine to college with her and so I came back and bought another one! It heats up quickly, gives a smooth and sleek look that really last for days so it keeps hair very manageable between shampoos! I have tried many straighteners and this compares to some of the higher end proffessional products that have been used on my hair.",5
I absolutely love this!  I can curl the ends or leave it straight with the twist of my hand.  Great quality!,5
"I have honestly never owned such an amazing straightener! I have really thick hair and the reason I ordered it was because of the good reviews I read, especially from people who have thick hair and they said it works perfect. It honestly only takes me 10 minutes to straighten my hair now but if I used any of the other straighteners I owned before it would take at least half an hour. Best money I have ever spent!",5
This is the best hair straightener ever made.Easy to use and doesn't dry out your hair like other hair straightener do..,5
"This is a wonderful product! My hair has never looked so good since I've started using it - very professional . It's important to establish a base line heat level for your hair, but once that's done, you get consistent results every time.",5
"So far I am happy with this flat iron...it gets the job done as well as my last and was a good price.  It also came with a sample of argan oil, a glove and carrying case.",4
"I purchased this through a lightening deal and I am so happy I was able to grab it for the price it was listed at. Every woman should have a ceramic flat iron. It is so much better for your hair and you definitely notice the difference. It takes less time to straighten my hair (I have thick, wavy/curly hair) and it leaves my hair feeling soft with a little shine. It doesn't feel like your burning your hair. It's worth the investment!",5
"I love this flat iron!  It works great for my semi-wavy, fine hair!  It leaves my hair soft and smooth.  Great buy!",5
"The straightener heats up quickly, and has an adjustable temperature knob. There is a glove provided which was to big for me, I have to let my hair settle a bit. This straightener does leave my hair silky and very smooth. I love it and can't wait to fix my hair when I'm getting ready for my day.",5
"I have always purchased the cheapest flat irons possible. However, I've also loved how the professional stylists always have the best flat irons. So I decided to research and find a professional flat iron hair straightener. Luckily, I found HSI The Styler at a reasonable price. It works great on my thick hair. My hair is so thick that other straighteners hardly worked, but the HSI gets hot enough to straighten my hair on the first couple of strokes. I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone with thick or course hair, or even thin hair since it has an adjustable heat setting.",5
"I purchased this HSI straightener in September of 2012 after years of buying straighteners from various brands that never lived up to my expectations. This product has never let me down. Ever. It leaves my naturally wavy, super fine hair as straight and shiny (and somehow still voluminous!) as I could possibly want it.For $50 this straightener is a STEAL!",5
I am replacing my $100.00 flat iron with this one!  Smooth hair!  Works better than any flat iron I have used.  My hair is shiney and beautiful!  Finally.,5
I love this flat iron. It's amazing on my hair and leaves it soft. I don't feel like it is damaging my hair like some flat irons do.,5
This product is a perfect little flat iron. It gets my hair super straight. And it comes with it's own travelling case and glove. Highly recommend.,5
"I purchased this flat iron sometime last week and have been using this since. Shipping was 3-4 days. Packaging was thoroughly packed right. Free items included with purchase consisted of black Heat resistant glove, red silk straightner pouch, and 5 ml of argan oil. Cant beat that! Threw out my old iron due to this fantastic iron/results. Did not see as many split ends from this particular iron as the old iron caused. Straightens, smoothes, and adds shine to hair with one slow glide without hair protecting products although such products are advised (I wanted to test a few sections of my hair without any hair products interrupting my test). I have wavy, puffy aka frizzy, a little below the shoulder length hair and live in Houston, TX. The current weather condition is humid (YES N DEC)and although its humid out, my hair still stayed intact quite well. Not as straight and sleek once finished straightening hair, but that's due to my crazy hair and not using Biosilk serum. But MY results from this particular iron has taken over my hair world and will be the only iron love of my life;P  A SIMPLE MUST HAVE STRAIGHTNER!",5
I'm very pleased with my purchase of the flat iron. It was a fret price for a great product. Works perfectly! And it is obviously made of high quality parts.,5
"I bought this for my Granddaughter ,and works perfectly , great quality, easy handling, very professional, incredible price, and my granddaughter looks very nice,",5
I love how quickly this iron heats up. It's done a super job and us a gear price! Definitely recommend this!,5
"The product is great, because it's safe to use warms up really quickly and really don't destroy my hair after using it.",5
"What is this project for my wife for her birthday and she could not be happier. It does exactly what it says and the best thing of all is the time it saves, what used to take her an hour to straighten her hair now she accomplish in about 20 minutes.",5
I have wavey hair.I have never before use a flat iron that straighten my hair like the HSI. This is the best flat iron I have ever used!!!!!,5
"I searched high and low for the perfect flat iron and I stumbled across this product. I've never heard of HSI, but then again I'm not really into a lot of the main hair care and styling brands. After reading the reviews and looking at the price, I decided to buy it. This is my very first flat iron, and after using it everyday since I've gotten it, I'm so happy with my decision. It leaves my hair softer and silkier than their metallic counterparts. And the most surprising thing is that it heats up SO fast!The outside part stays cool enough to handle, which makes straightening and styling a breeze. I also love the glove that comes with it to protect my free hand from the heat of my hair while styling.I love everything about it--the temperature control, fast heating, swivel cord, and the amazing price.Thank you so much, HSI Professional :)",5
"I bought one of these as a gift for my mom. She has thick, semi-course, half curly hair (not straightened, it looks like she has a bad perm job!) and the only flat iron that's worked for her thus far is a $300 iron that she borrowed from me (which met it's untimely end when she inadvertently knocked it off the bathroom counter). I was hesitant because of the price but it looked sturdy enough and I'm glad I took the chance.This flat iron delivers as promised.  She has been happily using it daily for over three months and has dropped it several times without repercussion - it also straitens as well as the $300 iron even on my fine, thick, half-curly hair.",5
"I bought this item as a anniversary gift for my wife (6th Anniversary and Iron is one of the traditional gifts, so obviously I got her Hair Irons). She has used them a couple of times so far and had no issues with them. Infact she stated that these are the best hair irons she has ever used! She has thick wavy hair and this glides over (wet and dry) and straightens a treat! Excellent product!",5
"This product has got to be the biggest bang for your buck! I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She doesn't know that I got it for such a low price and still thinks that I had spent hundreds  of dollars. Like I said, great product for an amazing price.",5
"I can only post my wife's reaction to this product since I don't use.  But, she loves it!  She was impressed with what all came with the flat iron.  She also said she believes this is the same one her stylist uses.  She told me to keep an eye out for another sale on this so she can buy her mom and sister one.",5
"After my expensive flat iron died, I decided to take a chance on the HSI Flat Iron. I could not be more pleased! It works better than the more expensive flat iron and does not dry out or fry my hair in the least, which is fantastic since I have extensions. It's easy to use and comes with a great travel bag and sample size of the HSI Argan oil. I highly recommend this product!",5
OKAY SO I TRIED AND IT WAS GREAT!! SO I HAVE BLEACHED BLONDE HAIR AND THAT IS A WHOLE LOT OF DAMAGE IN ITSELF. SO USING HEATING PRODUCTS ARE DANGER!! LOL BUT I SAW THIS WON READ THE REVIEWS AND DECIDED TO PURCHASE.. AND I AM GLAD I DID LEAVES MY HEAR STRAIGHT AND SOFT.. IT ALSO CAME WITH A SMALL BOTTLE OF ARGAN OIL AND IT IS GREAT BOUGHT MORE!! EVERY GIRL NEEDS THIS FLAT IRON!!,5
My fianc loves it she was goin to spend some crazy amount of money on one she ended up ordering this one and she loves it !,5
I bought this flat iron for my daughter and her hair never looked smoother. Just a couple of passes with this and she's out the door. It heats up quickly and has adjustable temperatures. I have paid over $100 for flat irons that don't compare to this.,5
"I have just a wave in my long hair but this product straightens it in no time and really gets the frizz out.  Easy to use and great for the price, have reccomended to my curley haired girls and friends!!!  It comes with oil, love it.",5
exceeded expectations. the decription of the product matched the results.well made. happily surprised by the complimentary hair oil and glove.  sturdily built this product should last a long time.,5
"My sister is a hair stylist so I've always had straighteners that were upwards of $100 because they are what she uses. Needless to say my expectations were not high based on the cost of this product. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this straightener is not only comparable to the more expensive ones I've used but better in many ways.  It heats up quickly and you don't have to pause for long periods of time while it reheats.  I am very, very happy with it and will recommend this to friends!",5
"very nice looking product, love the packaging. I bought 2 of these for gifts and will probably get 2 more.",5
This works very well and the amazing price!  I had been using CHI Brandt's one long time. But I wanted to save the money at this time. I have no regret so far.,5
"I have never used a chi but this was a big step up from the cheap $20 hair straighteners that you find in the drugstores.  One thing I don't like about this is my hair gets caught on the sides of the plates.  Other than that, for the price it's not that bad.",4
I usually spend $150 but this at $40 is a huge bargain. I'm thrilled with the money I saved and having the same great quality. It's nice that you can control the tempreture.,5
"The HSI flat iron is amazing!! I absolutely love it! It heats up very fast. I have thick, natural wavy hair that tends to frizz and look dry about 2 hrs. after styling..but not now!! MUCH better than my Chi!",5
"I've had 2 CHI irons and after reading the reviews on this one I decided to give it a chance.  After using CHI for several years, I conclude that I still love my CHI better than the HSI.  I do have to admit though that this HSI does do better than my old Revlon flat iron, but after using the HSI for two weeks I put it back in it's package and brought my old CHI back out.Here's why I like CHI better than the HSI:~CHI irons have the heat indicator light on the inside of the flat iron (which sounds odd, but to me it's very easy to see while holding the iron in your hand if the heat in the iron dropped or is still at the right temp while looking in the mirror).  When I hold the HSI iron the heat indicator light is on the outside of the iron right where I hold it so my hands cover the light up.  Seems like a small issue, but when you're in a hurry it's a pain to have to re-adjust my grip or set the iron down just so I can see if the heat is to the right temp or not.~Grip on the HSI is uncomfortable (made up on lots of small crisscrosses which indent in your fingers and even left marks).~Loses heat very easily (with comparison to CHI).  Ever 2-3 strands of hair (and I have thin hair) the heat was lost (the heat light indicator would change from green to red).~Lastly, it snagged on my hair.  Which having thin hair as it is and having strands ripped out of my head daily wasn't pleasant.Honestly, it's not the worst, but not the best.  I'll probably just use this one to take on vacations when we travel.",3
I bought this styler for my sister in law for christmas and she loves it.. I have never heard of it but she was totally wanting it and said that it was a great styler!!!,5
"I am very happy that i found very nice Hair Straighter! First of all price is great , second i resived in very short time. And most important it works greate , my hair lools shine and straigh it is amazing product!",5
"The same day I threw my old flat iron straightener in the trash, I saw an ad for this iron.  I ordered it and it arrived even quicker than I anticipated!  At first, I was put off because the iron was smaller than my previous one, but once I used it I knew it was a huge improvement!  I could feel from the weight of it that it was a better quality iron.  I love it!  It works smooth and fast.",5
"I ordered this flat iron about two weeks ago and got it in, its a pretty decent product but i wouldnt say as good as a chi. but overall worked really good. I was really excited about trying the sample of arogon oil that came with it but when i recieved my package, the top was not even screwed on and it was spilt over my entire package. pretty disapointing.",4
"I like this hair straightener - I needed a smallish sized one (as opposed to the bigger, fatter style), and this is perfect.  My hair is pretty thick and I was spending too much time using the blow dryer - once I got the hang of using a flat iron, I spend half the time on my hair now.  I am 62 years old - it's never too late to learn something new!",5
"I have owned many straighteners over the past 10 years.  The number has to be around 15.  I started buying off run of the mill, low quality ones from Walmart.  After watching my hair break off and become dry, I decided it was time to upgrade.The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener is the third high quality straightner that I have owned and it lives up to the standard I was expecting.If you are looking for a styler that heats up fast and seals in moisture, look no further!  Plus the swivel cord is a great touch.  No more getting caught or tangling!Although I have given this 5 stars, I am a bit confused as to why the temperature control is in such odd spot.  If it were up to me, I'd move it.  However, This seems to be a standard with many straighteners lately so I did not deduct any stars.The Pouch is a great addition.  No straightener I've owned has ever offered one with the product for free and I wanted one.  It's great for traveling to make sure my investment is protected.I would also like to mention that if the one inch plate makes you shy away from ordering this, it's a mistake.  I thought bigger was better and never would have given a second thought to one so thin.  Trust me, you don't need a flat iron bigger than an inch.  This does an amazing job of making your hair completely straight without any hair getting caught and being pulled.",5
"I purchased this flat iron for my daughter (Christmas gift).  I immediately tried it to make sure it worked well and was very happy how straight and shiny it left my hair.  At this price, it is definitely an excellent gift.  I am going to get another one for my teenage granddaughter!!",5
"I purchased this product for my daughter-in-law and she loves it!  She has thick hair and the iron grips it with just the right amount of tension and straightens it well.  It's just the right size, and the price was great! I don't know what else you could ask from a flat iron, but this one does exactly what she wants it to.",5
"I absolutely love the HSI Flat Iron Hair Straightener! I have thick, curly hair...so not every product is effective in giving me the soft and straight look that I want. I have been though numerous straighteners, and I give the HSI iron an A+. Quick heat up time, several heat options...and it also comes with a glove and heat-resistant bag. Overall...highly satisfied!",5
"Got the product quickly and my wife began using it.  She loves it so far, and it works great!  Even the carry bag that it comes with is a really nice quality bag.  As with any straightener, time will tell how long the device will hold up, but so far so good!",5
I was excited to try this flat iron after reading all the reviews.  It didn't straighten my hair to my expectations and made my hair feel like straw.  I guess I will be going back to the hot comb.  I also used it on my daughter's hair (finer than my hair) which didn't straighten her hair well and made it feel coarse.,2
"This was a present for my mom, she was very happy with the quality of the product and how it works. Top notch product because I also tested this product in my hair without being a professional in hair styling and I can say it worth for the price, the product is very easy to use.",5
"I have recently gotten my hair cut very short (a bob just below the chin) and it looks better straightened, however my regular one wasn't cutting it. I have very thick, wavy, stubborn hair and this worked great. Unlike the chi this has a temp. setting knob. For my hair I keep it about 400 degrees or so and it straightens with one swipe!  I will agree with some reviewers about the red/green light, I'm not sure what it means either, however I've noticed it usually changes color when I have it clamped shut on my hair and when I let go. Maybe it's a temp thing? Either way it doesn't hurt the performance.",5
Product is excellent given the price!  Lightweight & warms-up quickly. I would have given 5 stars if the controls were on the side rather than on the inside.,4
This hair straightener works very well...my hair is course and wavy and it easily straightens my hair.  Definitely recommend it.,5
"Heat up fast, went through hair real smooth, only took about 2-3 passes per section. Glove and case was a great touch.  will buy another for my daughters.",5
"Very impressed with this straightener. High quality and does not damage your hair. I use with Organix Moroccan Argan Oil and that keeps my hair from getting damaged. Hair is soft and very shiny with no tangles. Other straighteners left my hair feeling a little ""crispy"" and tangled, but this one works great. Really like the extra long cord. It also curls my hair very nicely. Since the curls hold really well, I don't have to use any product on my hair. This keeps them soft and bouncy. Would definitely recommend. A very good deal.",5
"I used to hate my hair. Naturally, I have this kinky hair with full lengths. It's extremely terrible that combing it wouldn't even make a difference. So basically, I was living with an electric iron by my side lol. I have used several brands but nothing came close to this one.The HSI Ceramic Hair Straightener produces straight and silky hair. It gave me the needed confidence that I lacked. When I was browsing through them, I was a bit apprehensive in this product because of the price; it was too cheap I thought. I also didn't know the brand. But when I used the product, it proved me wrong. Indeed, this is the best hair straightener that I have ever had.",5
"After reading all of the great reviews on this flat iron, I decided to order one myself. I was so impressed with how quickly it was shipped! It seems like a good quality product, however I had 2 problems with it. The first thing is that the flat iron part that's supposed to be smooth has a couple rough spots on it and it catches my hair and breaks it. The other thing is that it doesn't get keep my hair straight, even with it turned all the way up. I have fine/thin fuzzy hair which I can usually get to straighten with other irons I've tried, so I'm not sure if my HSI iron is not working correctly or what.",3
My hair is super curly so its usually hard to straighten but this flat iron has adjustable temperature settings that allow you to use the perfect amount of heat. It heats up quickly and works much better than my previous flat iron. I am very happy with this purchase.,5
this is a great flat iron at a wonderful price.  you can't go wrong. I will probably purchased two more for my daughters who also think its great!,5
Works great! This is my first time buying this brand and so far I am very satisfied. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family,5
All the reviews are right this straighter is the best I have used and my hair looks just as it does when I leave the salon and they use the chi. It even came with a glove so I dont burn my fingers anymore!,4
i would like that was more large like  1/2 inch  but all find the price was the best good item,4
"I bought this for my wife as an early Christmas present.  A nice hair straightener has always been at the top of her wish list, but she has expensive tastes, unfortunately.  She has always wanted a Chi, but now that she has this one, she actually prefers this one to it.  At $40 this is a really great deal, since similar products of this caliber can easily go for twice that price (if not more).  The iron itself gets hot very quickly, and she's able to do a lot with her hair that she couldn't do with her previous straightener.Very good deal on a great product.  No complaints!",5
"I was a little hesitant to buy a higher price flat iron. I looked at the CHI, but could not get myself to spend $80-$100. I saw the reviews on this and thought for $40 I would gamble. It was no gamble at all. I love the Iron and the heat controle setting. I like the rounded shape that allows me to do a curl under or flip out. If you are considering a great flat iron order this one!!!",5
"I purchased this item as my old Hair straightener didn't flat my  hair as i wanted to be.Since the first time that i used HSI i noticed the difference with other straightener that i have used before. It took a short time to straight my hair that lasted longer. Also the oil at the package helped a lot and kept my hair smooth and bright.I highly recommend to buy and use HSI, its worth it.",5
iam soo happy with this flat iron  for only 38.00 it was a good dealiam goin to buy another one,5
"got it for my girlfriend, she loves it...works great! the oil that came with it also worked perfectly. she hasn't given me any bad reviews, hope it stays that way",5
I love this flat iron. I was looking for a CHI when I read the reviews for the HSI. Upon its arrival I washed and dried my hair( I usually go to my stylist for a wash and style every two weeks) rubbed a little of the oil sample in my hair and was truly amazed at the results. As I said I don't normally do my hair other than daily hair styles in between appts. I love my flat iron and intend on purchasing another for my daughter.,4
"This product is a very solid professional-style flat iron.  heats up faster and warmer, not flimsy, very solid and a pleasure to use.",5
Love the product and how my hair looked when done. Shipped a little slow but no problems at all and I love the straightener.,5
This is a very nice product at a good price. It is also good for a gift as it is packaged nicely.,4
"I have very unruly hair and am very picky with my styling tools...this one is amazing! I bought it based on many positive reviews and I am very pleased! My hair straightens very easily and holds style well; it also takes half the time of my previous straightener.Finally, the price is great...I am going to order another one for my daughter!",5
"I am so satisfied with this product, my teenagers have always used a Chi and this is as fab as the Chi. The price is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who has teenage girls or anyone who straightens their hair.HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch",5
"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, after reviewing many straighteners, especially Chi's I was able to determine that this product was just as good or even better than the Chi.  I gave the gift early and she loves this product, I hear everyday how great of a present it was.  I am glad that I choose this product and would recommend the HSI Flat Iron to anyone that was in the market.",5
"I love this iron, its so easy to use and makes my hair very silky and shiny, would definitely recommend this.",5
I was in need for a new straightener and couldnt pass up the price. This has been one of the best ones I have used. Love that it comes with the bag as well. I will be ordering another when my daughter needs a new one.,5
"I still have a hard time believing the price I paid for this gem. Save your bucks and go with this iron!  Don't think twice, just do it. A gazillion positive reviews can't be wrong. Works just as well as my Paul Mitchell iron. I also like the oil that came with it! I am very pleased.",5
"HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inchI have been using a ceramic Tourmaline flat iron for years on my hair to straighten it and last week mine died.  I went onto Amazon and found one that looked good so I purchased it.  After I used it I realized how my other one had aged.  My hair is much straighter and lasts longer with my new one.  They sent me a free bottle of oil to use with it but unfortunately the fragrance is too strong for me to use so I am just using it with my mousse.  I am chemically sensitive and work with many who also are so I can't use strong fragrances or any for that matter.  Otherwise, I love the flat iron!!",5
Great flatiron very happy with quality my daughter has course hair and it makes her hair silky and smooth great product!!,5
"I bought this flat iron to replace my CHI flat iron, which I loved but stopped working after owning it for less than a year.  The best thing I can say about this iron is that it is OK.  I have very long hair, but very fine, so it shouldn't take much to get it straight.  This iron does not get as hot as the CHI so it takes quite a bit longer to get through my hair.  It is also much heavier than I am used to, so by the time I am finished I feel like I've been through a weight lifting class.  It also does not glide through my hair as easily, and if I'm not careful it will pull out my hair.  So...long story short, I will keep it and use it because I paid for it, but I will certainly be on the look out for deals on other flat irons.",3
"I love this iron, it is basic, not complicated, and easy to use.  I was supprised at how fast it heats up, and it gets hotter than I need it to.  For the price, I don't think there is anything better out there.",5
My sister was actually the one to purchase this item and she liked it!She thought it was cheap compared to other items.,5
"Great price but not even close to a Chi for my thick, wavy, coarse hair. Just OK but nothing special.",3
I sent this as a gift to my mother and she let me know that she absolutely loves it! It arrived fast and with no problems. It works great! I would recommend this to anyone!,5
I'm not an expert on these but it does what I need a flat iron to do and it arrived very quickly. I would buy this again for sure.,5
The iron works great and heats up super quick. I've got thick wavy hair; the iron makes my hair smooth and shiny and stays straight all day. I was surprised when it came with a tiny bottle of argan oil and a heat glove. My only complaint is that I have trouble straightening my bangs because the iron is a little too thick to get close to the scalp which why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.,4
"This is the BEST Flat Iron Hair Straightener I have found! The unit heats up quickly and provides a smooth iron without scorching. I love the cord length that allows free movement while smoothing my hair. I have used several other, more expensive irons, and this one is defiantly the best!",5
"The straightener comes as described and works perfectly. Very ergonomic also. I got it in 3 days, with a starter of HSI Argan oil bottle, free of charge. I am super satisfied with the product and the service.",5
"I ordered this straightener after reading all the rave reviews and it did not disappoint!! I am so thrillled with this product. I have very thick, very curly hair and it straightened my hair in about 20 minutes, whereas before it would take at least 45 minutes. It heats up very quickly and is extremely easy on my hair, no tugging or pulling and very smooth. It's also perfect for making curls! Definitely one of the best purchases I've ever made! Wouldn't recommend any other brand.",5
LOVE this flat iron! I love the fact that you can control the temperature so your not frying your hair. Plus the flat iron came with safety gloves and a sample bottle of argan oil. Overall it's worth the money and the shipping was FAST.,5
I love this for the price. It's really hot and it gets my hair super flat. It's a great deal. The only think I don't love is it doesn't have a switch to keep it closed like some of my other flatirons do and it's on off is on the inside so it's slightly harder to get to or see than I would normally like.,5
"This package arrived right on time, as always with any purchase I have ever had with Amazon.After using this flat iron, my hair has been so sleek and shiny! I was nervouse because I am used to using a 2in flat iron, but the 1in works wonders on my super thick hair!  Plus, I couldn't beat the price in comparison to other flat irons, however I believe this one works just as well as other more expensive products I have used.",5
"love love love this product. you will see how this worked out for your hair. Be smooth and silk!!I love the argan oil too, very helpful for my hair. Just get it girls!",5
"I have not yet tried the straightener because I purchased it as a back up to my current straightener. However, I am extremely pleased with the customer service that they provided. It was great to have so much contact with a seller on Amazon. Thank you!",5
This is by far the best iron I have used on my daughters course hair. I don't have to pull it through muliple times...it just works and no burn smell,5
I love this product better than my chi which is saying a heck of a lot. The product glides effortlessly on my curly hair and straightens without any of the nasty smoke and burn smell.,5
"My girlfriend who I ordered this straightener for lovea it. Works great leaving her hair straight and very shiny. Even the shipping was great! Very happy wirh this purchase, would buy from them again.",5
Love it!  Works great and gets hot enough to do the job. Highly recommended by me. It's a must have!,5
I've had my chi for over 5 years!! i loved it. I wasnt sure what i wanted to replace it with until i read all of the reviews on here. So i bought this one... and im not disappointed. I think its better than my old chi to be honest. My hair is very shiny and soft. I would recommend it.,4
"The HSI Flat Iron is my favorite flat iron.  I've purchased two others over the past 5 years, but this one is my favorite by far.  I have very thick wavy hair and the HSI flat iron really does the job.  I don't have to flat iron the same sections over and over, which is really nice.  The flat iron is very well made.  It has a good grip and is easy to use.",5
Way better than what I was thinking as it wasn't really expensive as the CHI! I have VERY curly hair and this iron worked great at straightening...So many compliments the first day! Can get a bit hot-- but just dial down the temp to what you need it at.  Digital version of this would be nicer but all and all great product!,5
The HSI Flat Iron is the best iron I have ever owned to date. I have a lot of hair and it's really curly and this iron leaves my hair super straight and silky. I really recommend this straightening iron.,5
"This straightener is worth every penny. It is very sturdy and is able to straighten my fairly thick and wavy hair easily. I would definitely recommended, especially considering the great price.",5
It's good for the money but not as good as a chi hair straightener. My gf testifes to this.  Good buy tho,4
"What a great iron! Leaves my hair silky and smooth. Heats up very quickly and love the temperature dial. Yes you would pay much more for this so it is a great deal! Would definitely recommend. Oh, the seller is fabulous as well.",5
so far this product has been great its hot enough for my hair (i have long medium - fine hair it has cut down the time i have to spend straightening it and would def recommend to anyone.,4
"The product was good and i am satisfied. The best part was it is suitable for both 110 v and 220v, for which i can send it to my country. Thanks HSI for providing such a good product",4
Wonderful professional style straightener!  I love the heat control knob.  This makes it very fast and easy to switch temps.  I also like the snug fit of the panels...this helps the hair stay put while straightening.  Once straightened my hair looks great and stays smooth even in high humidity.,5
"Ok, so I ordered this item just a few days ago. I had a cheap flat iron and it really didn't get hot enough to straighten my hair like I wanted, plus it pulled my hair at times.  I love the price of this one!!! What a bargain. It heats up super fast. It doesn't take but just a few minutes now to be done with straightening my hair. I tried the sample of the argan oil and couldn't believe how soft it made my coarse hair feel.  I will definitely be buying a bottle of the HSI argan oil and soon as my sample runs out.",5
This has got to be the best straightener that I have even bought! I have fine hair and it is hard to find a product that I love for my hair. It is so smooth and my hair style last all day! Plus I love the HSI Argan Oil that came with the straightener. Great Product!!!!,5
"Well, I can honestly say the price attracted me plus it looks like good quality.  I got it pretty quick and have been in love ever since. :-) Now i want to find a decent priced curling wand.",5
Love Love this flat iron! Such an awsome deal for the price. We bought a total of 3 so that I wouldn't have to share mine with my daughters!!,5
"If you get this they give you a sample of the argon oil.  That sh!t has changed my fine hair.  I love it.  I like the versatility of the iron, but don't use it nearly as much as my curling irons (I have very limp hair- i need to add body).  I'm sure once I get the hang of it and use it more i'll use it more often!",4
"I had used the same $200 flat iron for 7 years when it finally died. I came on amazon expecting to spend hundreds of dollars for a replacement however at the top of the page was this flat iron and it had great reviews and was a top seller but I was still worried it wouldn't work great but figured I could give it a shot for $40 and I was not disappointed! It was delivered a day early, was packaged great and the flat iron has a nice heavy feel. It doesn't heat fully instantly but pretty quickly and made my very think curly hair instantly straight. The part I was most impressed by was the straight lasted two days instead of two hours. Also something different about it was the plug was the kind a hair dryer would have, meaning it has a reset button. This beat my old expensive flat iron easy.",5
This flat iron is much better than the ones you get in the local drug or discount store but not much more expensive. High end quality for a budget price. I'm very happy with it.,5
I love this straightener- the cord never get wrapped up when I try to use it and it heats up very quickly. Great product for the price!,5
"I bought this product because i saw the excellent reviews and i want it to try it.. Every review was RIGHT!! I love it.. I was using a very famous brand for more than 10 years because i didn't trust any other brand. I was skeptical at first but after i use it for three weeks my mind change.. it leaves the hair very silky and looks great, it heats super fast and very easy to handle.. i have no problems at all.. I highly recommend this hair iron..IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR TOP LIST :):) ***** five stars**",5
"Have had this flat iron for a little less than a month now, and really seems to be working well.  It heats up quickly, and does a quick job smoothing and straightening my long hair.  It seems like I can get my hair done faster now than with my old flat iron, and the smoothing effects seem to last longer.  I do like the long cord on this flat iron too.  As I do have long hair, it would be nice if the plates were a little larger though.  However, it really hasn't been that big of a deal so far.  The price was certainly reasonable.",5
I have wavy hair and i dont like too much heat. This worked very well on my hair with warm setting,5
Caught on sale and she loved it.  Heats up and does great job. Comes with nice sleeve and glove and bottle of hair serum.,5
"I have tried a lot of flat irons, I love this one I have dry fine hair it doesn't seem to break my hair off as much",5
"i did my research, on how to buy a flat iron and this product met all the qualifications, my girlfriend uses it and her comes out really nice, it doesnt burn or anything. i would say this product is worth every penny and the quality is great.",5
"I have ZERO complaints about this flat iron.  Its quick to heat up, and cool down.  Dry or wet hair no problem.  Dropped mine on the ground a few times and it still works like a pro!",5
This is a nice styler.  It's light and not too heavy.  It comes with a very pretty pouch for travel and storage.  A wide range of heat settings.,4
The HSI Hair Straightner works great.  It is easy to use and straightens my hair makes my hair look straight and shiney. It is a lot better than my old hair straightner and cheaper.,5
Product works great on me and my two daughters.  We all have very thick hair and this does a great job.,5
This is a salon quality flat iron that even an amateur can get great results from! Great product. I would highly recommend purchasing this item- you won't be disappointed.,5
"I actually did not order this product.  My boyfriend ordered it for me after noticing that my hair straightener was falling apart. I was not familiar with the brand, but so far no complaints. It is definitely good quality. It heats up quickly, gets extremely hot and the glove included in the box comes in handy. Considering the price, it seems to be a steal of a deal.  The same results if not better than any Chi straightener I have used in the past.",4
"It is definitively a good product for it's price, but that doesn't make it a 5 star product. Chi is still way better quality wise, don't make a fool out of yourselve.",3
"The product was excellent.  Love the controls to change temperature and the on-off switch.  Reasonably prices - meaning it didn't cost me over $50 - and does the same job as those costing hundreds.  Seller was awesome, and shipping was FAST!",5
"No need to spend $100 or more.  I was so happy with this flat iron, I bought another one for my daughter!",5
"I bought this for my 19 year old with very curly hair. She loves it, says it does a great job!",5
"LOVE this straightener! Makes my hair so easy to style! Easy to use, I can straighten and curl my hair fast!",5
"I completely agree with the other reviewer that this HSI flat iron is better than the almost 3x more expensive Chi. I had one of the Chi, which worked well until it broke only after a few uses. Apparently that model had a lot of problems based on many of the reviews I've read (after the fact of buying it, bad on me). I've had the HSI iron for about a month now and it works great. The plates seem to work better (feels smoother going through hair) and it heats up fast. It took me a little practice and some experimenting to get my hair to flip and curl the way I wanted. A whole lot faster than my curling iron (which is now tucked away in a drawer somewhere). Haven't had it long enough to comment on longevity but at least I know it outlasted the Chi and saved me a whole lotta money!",4
Hands down the best flat iron I have ever used! I will buy an extra for myself and one for each of my daughters. My fair was soooo soft after using this iron and beautifully straight. Great buy at any cost,5
"I have fine hair that is fairly straight to begin with. This straightener did the job but not extremely well. I returned it however because it pulled my hair. My hair seemed to catch on something, I'm not sure what.",2
Its the real thing for a down to earth price finally! My friends all have the expensive Chi straighteners and I just never felt that paying $100+ for a product like that was really worth it. Thank gosh I found this great deal on amazon. I use this straightener every day and its performing just as well as my friends straighteners that I always used to borrow.,5
Bought this flat iron for my daughters Birthday and she loves it! Highly recommend.. looking to to buy more for Christmas!!,5
"I'm amazed that this is much better than my old hair straightener that I had used for a couple of years. It usually takes me 30 minutes to straighten my wavy long and thick hair, but now, with this ceramic tourmaline hair straightener, it takes me less time to straighten my hair! Plus my hair feels lighter and smoother. I also use the Argan oil that's included in the package and it adds a more smooth texture on my hair. I love it!",5
"While I can't attest to how robust and long-lasting this flat iron is, I definitely love using it!  The argan oil that comes with the flat iron is very nice as well, my hair doesn't feel damaged or look fried like it would without it!  The controls are placed in a somewhat odd spot, but after finding a good temperature, you shouldn't need to mess with them anyway!  Definitely a good buy, especially for the price, and I'm glad to have a working flat iron again!",5
"Bought this for my fiance to replace a NUME she dropped and broke (this is why we cant have nice things).  She states that it is at least as good, or better than the nume.  All I know is it makes her happy in the morning, a time when she is usually very angry.",5
"This flat iron really works!  My previous flat irons did not work as well and dried out my hair.  This one locks in the moisture and is easy to use, so takes much less time.  I love it!",5
I bought this flat iron in hopes it would just as good as the CHI if not better. I have gone through 2 CHIs in two years which seems a little ridiculous for as much as you spend on them to break a year after the purchase. This flat iron works amazingly and makes my hair look silky smooth. Exactly what I was looking for.I would buy more from HSI in terms of hair care.,5
"I was always wanting to straighten my hair but was uncertain which iron to buy.  I love this iron.  I feel safe using this, that it won't damage my hair.  My hair looks great after I straighten it with this flat iron.  It's so easy!",5
"I received this product and immediately starting using it.  I was using another top brand, but it was not getting the job done.  I could tell with one pass that this iron was was going to work well.  My hair was straight and shiny.  Thank you for making a wonderful product.",5
"Needed a flat iron read the reviews and the HSI iron was ordered. It was inexpensive so I wasn't expecting much, I was incorrect it is. The Argan oil that comes with it great bonus.",5
I'll post a more detailed update later but my wife and daughter absolutely LOVE this hair straightener.  Their comments were that it is the best they've ever used and was well worth the money.  My daughter uses it very frequently and still occasionally mentions how well it works.This would make an excellent gift.,5
"I have to be honest... GOOD! I am usually really unsure of how to respond to ads about "" The Best Product Around!!""...but I have to admit that I am TRULLY satisfied with the HSI flat iron. I was at the mall and I stopped by one of those stands that sold ceramic flat irons and the guy that convinced us to stop, attempted to flat iron my daughters hair! I was skeptical because my daughter has hair down her back and it is really thick! To my surprise, those flat irons were wonderful but  he wanted to sell them to me for $200.00! I went home that night, checked on Amazon for the same brand and I came across the HSI Flat Irons. I did my research, read the reviews and finally placed my order! I love them! My only complaint is that I wish they were a little bit wider than 1"" for women with thicker, longer hair. I have no problem recommending this product to anyone who is searching for a good quality flat iron that actually gives you the results you want!",4
Just received my straightener today and figured I would test it curling my hair seeing as that's more difficult. It worked amazingly and I got many compliments. The only reason for a 4 star rather than a 5 star review is the free argon oil was completely opened and emptied all over my carrying case!Works great though!!! :),4
Daughter birthday present and she says it works great!  Purchased after speaking with my hair professional and reading  reviews.  Excellent value.,5
Love it! This straightener gets rid of all my frizz and the oil it comes with is amazing! I recommend buying it.,5
Works great on all hair types!!! I have African American hair and this iron works excellent!!! As good as top brands!,5
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I couldnt wait to give it to her, as she wanted to use my daughters, but she was away. Heats up quick, did exactly as she wanted it to do. Highly recommended!",5
I highly recommend this product. It's the first flat iron that has left my hair smelling weird. Again I love them!!,5
This is a classy looking hair straightener and works great!. I love how smooth and shiny it makes my hair look. Definitely recommended,5
I really like the light weight and narrow grip since i have tiny hands.It doesn't have pieces that my hair gets caught on like the junk one I owned before this.Overall - i LOVE IT!  :),5
"That's a real ceramic straightener, doesn't burn your hair at all. Makes your hair looks really shiny and beautiful.It also curls the hair very well. You won't be disappointed, I totally recommend it.",5
"I bought this straightener on Amazon for my wife. Her old one shorted out or something similar to that. I look at all the reviews online and read on some websites that HSI makes an excellent flat iron.  So, I decided to give it a go and see how my wife liked it. It came in a great package that looked fairly professional. My wife opened everything up and look at all the contents. It came with a glove, a little bottle of Argan oil, and the flat iron itself. She's told me that it is one of the better straighteners that she has used. It seems to heat up well, maintain heat across the surface evenly, and straighten the hair with a professional look. So, I guess this is wife approved.",5
"My daughter-in-law loves this product, easy to use, flattens her hair very quickly, leaves her hair more manageable. Would buy again. Great seller as well.",5
"When I decided to purchase another set of flat irons, my first instinct was to get CHIs because of all the hooplah!  These flat irons are equivalent or better, as I have tried CHI brand before.  Not to mention the price difference.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I will do an update if my feeling about this product changes.",5
I bought this straightener to replace my old one that was falling apart.  It works great so far.  I like it that you can adjust the temperature.,4
Works a lot better than my last one that would get too hot in my hands. It is definitely worth the money!,5
This was an amazing price for this product!!! It works great and heats up instantly.  Hopefully it will last longer than my last two Chi flatirons.,5
We got this for a good price and it heats up fast and it presses well. I enjoy this ceramic hair straightener,5
"I absolutely love this flat iron/hair styler.  First of all, I received it very quickly (in 2 days, I think) and the packaging was very nicely secure in a box with the Amazon logo on the outer box.  The box that actually contained the styler was not damaged and actually had the serial numbers on the outside of it to register the product (which I did about a week after I received it). I opened the box to find a beautiful red bag, a glove (reminded me of the Michael Jackson glove wearing era) and a little sample bottle of the Argon oil (which is fabulous!) as well as the styler, of course.  Hands down this is the best flat iron I have ever used, point blank and the period!!! I totally ditched the one I was using which was from Sally's that I paid $80 for!When I used if for the first time, I could not believe how shiny, smooth, silky and bouncy it leaves my hair.  I am African American with medium wavy/curler hair naturally however, I do have it relaxed and colored  so I do not need to turn the heat up to the highest capacity; I use it at about 350 degrees. Which leads me to the only thing I could say that could be an improvement, digital readout of the temperature.  Other than that, it is a great flat iron.  The heat in this HSI Styler is so evenly distributed and it does not smoke, like all of the other flat irons that I have used.  I want to purchase another one just to have a back up.  In a nutshell, I LOVE IT!",5
"I got this for my girlfriend, who has hair that tends to be a bit fussy on humid days. Her previous flat iron was hard to close and use, and made her arms tired to the point that I heard complaints coming from the bathroom every time she used it. The madness had to stop, and the HSI flat iron came to the rescue! This flat iron far exceeds the previous one in performance, being easy to grasp, clamp, and pull. The temperature is also easy to adjust with the clearly-labeled dial and the light that comes on lets you know when the iron is on, so there is no confusion about whether or not the iron is on. Overall, it's a great product and has made my girlfriend happy, which means I am a happy guy as well!",5
I have mostly straight hair but my ends tend to be pretty wavy and hard to straighten. This flat iron straightens my wavy ends in just one pass! It has significantly shortened the amount of time it takes to get my hair pin straight!This iron works better than other more expensive brands that I have purchased in the past.The argan oil that was included makes my hair feel super soft. Love it!I definitely recommend this flat iron!,5
I've had this Straightener for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I've been using a old straightener for years and didn't know how much I hated it until I got this. The LED light and controls let me know when it's ready. The included glove is a nice bonus and it does it's job well. Using this has saved me about 10 minutes getting ready since I can use it faster then my old one. I would recommend it to anyone.,5
This product is great! It heats up quickly and you can control the temperature. This is a replacement for a CHI that i had. One con is you don't know the exact temperature. It straightens nicely I have thick and hair that is half way down my back and I have no problem with this straightener. I also can curl easily with this flat iron! Great product and even better price,5
I absolutely love this flat iron. I have tried several but this one works great and is a fantastic deal.  I would recommend it to anyone!  It is rounded on the side of the ceramic heating plate and does a great job curling too!,5
"I LOVE this straightener, and you can not go wrong for the money!  No point in spending hundreds of dollars, this HSI iron does the job and quickly!  No more frizzy hair, but a smooth, straight look.  I haven't tried curling my hair yet with it, but it is very easy to use and seems effortless to do.Highly recommend!!!",5
"My Chi straightner recently passed away and I was hoping I wouldn't have to spend the big $$ to replace it.  I was willing to give the HSI a try after reading the other reviews.  I agree that it works as well as my recently departed Chi.  The one drawback is that it does not heat up as quickly as the Chi.Curiously, it came with a black glove and I dont know why?Very good product and you can't beat the price!",4
"Love the flat iron, better than Chi. Came with protective glove and Argan oil which is incredible! I get compliments on my hair all the time when I use it!",5
"This is my first flat iron so I don't have anything to compare it to.  I bought it based on the good reviews.  I like that it came with its own case, and a glove.  I have a lot of gray hair that I color but it has made my hair corse and my hair is thick so I loved how my hairdresser transformed my hair into smooth and shiny flat hair with a flat iron.  I have only used this 3 times and I have been happy with the results.  The instruction pamphlet is a little basic so I went to you tube to look at videos of how to use the flat iron and they helped tremendously.  Very solid, professional flat iron and I am happy with it.",5
Product has exceeded expectations. Works flawlessly without any issues at a fraction of some of the other brands cost. This product is used nearly daily and I will update this comment in the future if the experience with this product changes. Great product thus far.,5
"This straighter has the quality beyond the under 40 dollars that it cost to purchase.  The seller was amazing, the product arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  I have recommended this product to all of my girlfriends and adore the straighter.  This replaced a 130 dollar straighter I had and the quality surpasses it.  Buy this and you will not regret it.",5
"I have only been using this flat iron for a month or so after my Paul Mitchell flat iron died from many years of usage, and so far, I think it is doing just as good of a job as my Paul Mitchell.  I would give this a try before shelling out the money for a CHI.",5
"Well worth the money, and in no way does it pull your hair. Plus I have curly hair so it does the job great!",5
"I bought this to replace an old flatiron and could not be more pleased with it.  The heat is adjustable so I don't fry my thin/brittle hair, and it heats up extremely quickly.  Comes with a nice satin case for storage (although the plug doesn't fit in with it, I just wrap the cord around the case).  The rounded shape creates the perfect curl at the bottom without any dents.  Two thumbs up :)",5
"It is a great hair straightener for the price. I got it because my cheap one basically stopped working. My hair is very thick, and just soaks up the heat. This one definitely does the job and completely straightens my hair. And it stays straight too.",5
"It's excellent! It's a great straightener, leaves the hair shining and smooth! I love it! So far, it's the best I've ever had!!",5
I was in doubt at first... But all the positive reviews were true! This works like those in salons that are sold for over 200 bucks,5
"I have long, fine hair and it's very thick with natural wave. Straightening usually takes a long time and I was hoping this straightener would cut the time and eliminate the little wave that's left to be perfectly straight and silky.Similar to my old straightener, I keep it on a medium setting to not fry the fine hair. I take small sections and try to go slow, but still have to run over them repeatedly. (And it never goes salon-straight).I guess I'm really in the same position I was in before, but with a newer straightener. Oh well.",3
This has been the best straightner I have used so far... Not only does it straighten my hair but I'm also able to curl it too and the curls last all day.... My hair always comes out really straight and frizz free.. i love this product,5
"This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  I've had 4 other flat irons and was only satisfied with one of them.  My 12 year old daughter kept taking it, so I decided to purchase a new flat iron for myself.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this one out.  We absolutely love it. It gets hot quickly and does a great job of straightening my curly hair.  My daughter now keeps taking this one!",5
"It is a great flat iron and I like it very much. I read other reviews to determine if I would purchase, and I was not disappointed. Yes I would recommend the HSI........ Thanks again.",5
The straightener takes only a few minutes to heat up.. The serum that came with it is INCREDIBLE and makes my hair smell great and makes it super smooth. I can curl and flip my hair as I'm straightening it. I have no complaints whatsoever. Awesome awesome product =),5
"This flat iron is better than my previous flat irons which cost at least double what I've paid for it on Amazon. It straightens my wavy hair quicker than my previous flat irons and leaves it smooth and silky. I only go through an area once or twice at the most and I use it with the HSI Thermal Protector and they work very well together. I cannot believe the brand isn't more popular! I'd recommend this to anyone, especially at this price.",5
After reading the reviews I bought this for my sister.  She said that it makes her hair feel like it was done professionally.  Excellent product!!  Thank you,5
"I love this straightener! I also love that the straighter comes with a bag to put it in when traveling or whenever and a glove and a sample of Argan oil. The thing I especially love about this is that it never pulls my hair out, and my hair doesn't get caught in this one and hurt! That was an issue I had with my previous straightener. Would recommend!",5
"My hair is not thick, nor curly.  It is of a medium thickness and is wavy (the severity of the waves increases the shorter my hair is).  This iron does a great job flattening the waves in a short amount of time at the highest temperature.",4
"This straightener is fantastic!  I was scared to order it, because I had never heard of HSI, the price seemed too good to be true, and I previously owned a CHI, which was a very nice straightener.  I received my HSI straightener 3 days after ordering and am so impressed.  It does a terrific job making my hair beautifully smooth (my hair is typically frizzy/curly) and it didn't take as long as my CHI.The only downside is that it doesn't lock closed.  This isn't a huge problem because it comes with a nice lined bag, but I would prefer if it stayed closed.  Not really a big deal",5
Works great! Highly recommend! Had a hard time turning it on but after resetting it a few times worked smoothly...speaking of the sample of argan oil also does wonders! This is my first straightener and am so glad I went with this- very easy to use for a newbie with very curly hair to use!,5
I love this Flat Iron. It is lightweight and easy to use.  Professional quality.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Thanks for the quick shipping and ease of ordering.,5
"I purchased this product after receiving an alert that it was on sale for $39.99. Let me start off by saying that I am a cheapskate and hate to spend money on things that are a necessity, but trying to use one straightener between myself and my teenage daughter was too much. So I decided to buy myself one.It heats quickly and did a fine job on my hair. My only complaint is that it does not have an auto shut-off, so I would not reccommend this for an underage users due to the potential of them leaving it on and burning the house down. With this being said, I actually have to wait for it to cool down and hide it so this doesn't happen.With that being said, that's why I have it 4 out of 5. And I def would not pay the retail price. I think $40 is almost on the higher end of a basic straightener such as this one.",4
I can't believe how much better this flat iron works compared to the regular kind I used to use. I've been so frustrated with my hair for a long time but now it looks great!,5
This product works as well as a much more expensive flat iron my daughter has. It even came with a glove so I do t burn my hand.,5
It is very good and very light as well.Thanks for this product.I would recommend this. Its a worth.,4
"I am so happy with this flat iron. Not only was it a great deal, it is so easy to use. I had tried one that a friend of mine had and was so clumsy with it, I decided that I should not even buy one.  Then, I read reviews on this product on Amazon and since the price was so good, I decided to go for it. Couldn't be happier!",5
I just got this last week (extremely quick delivery I might add!) and have had the chance to use it several times now. I have frizzy multi textured curly hair and this straightens me out in a 1/4 of the time as my old one - also texture is just like when they do at salon - which I can never usually achieve with old one! I have only turned it up a little over half way so far too!,5
"I've been using this for the past week never having used a flat iron before.  The heating time is very short and it retains the temperature very well. Easy to use, the cord won't tangle and slides very easily over my hair. I like the oil that came with it too, leaves hair shiny! So far very pleased with the purchase and would reccommend.",5
"This hair iron initially snagged my hair so I contacted the vendor, Blue Novelties, and they were more than happy to send me another unit- no hassles.  They have amazing customer service.  They assured me that the iron was snagging my hair because it was not maintaining constant heat and sent out a replacement promptly.  I like the iron because all the controls are on the interior of the iron.  Other irons have the heat settings and on/off button on the outside so as I grab the iron I may shut off the iron without meaning to.  That is my favorite part of this iron.  Also, it has a nice grip on the hair so it straightens more efficiently.  The smaller plates make it nice to be able to get the roots of the hair straight.  I love the sleeve that it comes with for traveling and storing.",4
It's a wonderful flat iron for a fraction of the price of most! love it! the argon oil that came with it is great too!,5
"I bought this for my daughter to replace another model that had broken.  It is very sturdy and I love that you can adjust the temperature.  In fact, I like it better than my $100 CHI. I should have purchased one for myself!",5
"This flat iron is amazing! It has kept my hair flat, silky, and soft for the past 5 day! I was very impressed when I tried the product. I recommened this to people with thick or curly hair! But it works great on my friend who has stright hair as well. I also love the plates on the iron because it doesn't burn my hair and it is a easy, smooth glide between the plates and my hair! If you are looking to buy this product, I totaly would recommended this to you! Over all this is a super amazing flat iron, and maybe a little bit better than my CHI... (:",5
"I had a Chi flat iron for years and I have missed it dearly since it stopped working. I just couldn't see myself shelling out $140+ for another one so I have been trying cheaper store bought versions that have not worked very well for me. This flat iron is very comparable to the Chi and I love it! I have naturally curly/frizzy hair and it needs a great flat iron (and serum) to help tame it. This iron heats up very fast and I've been using the serum that came with it and I have to say that my hair looks amazing! Thank you HSI for making such a great flat iron, and an affordable one at that :) Also, Amazon shipped it to me so quickly it was a very nice surprise to come home to after a long day at work.Thanks Again,Nicole G.",5
"I must admit that I am impressed with the HSI Ceramic flat iron.  Everyone was talking about another brand, but for the savings I took a chance on HSI.  I have used it several times with the argon oil and am so very pleased with the results.  It heats up fast, is very easy to handle and light weight.  I love the bright red storage bag too.  Most of all my hair is finally in controll from the frizzies. This product is a winner for my hair and my pocketbook.  Bonus:  It arrived 3 days ahead of schedule.  Thanks so much.",5
"My Fiance has used hair irons for years.  I bought this as a birthday present.  Not only did she like the way if felt in her hand, she liked the styling of it.  But when she used, it made her hair straight, but softer and silkier than she thought possible.  Amazing.",5
I got this for my wife. She loves the fact it heats up in seconds and that you can due more then just straighten. A+++++,5
I have had several Chi irons-that I loved. This one totally compares in ability-BUT WAY better on price! I am a fan and will buy HSI from NOW ON!!!,5
"I was hoping that this iron would be Great and it is.  It does get very hot, which is what I wanted.  I have curley hair and at times can be tough to straighten.The only thing that I do not like about this flat iron is that it does not turn off automatically after an hour.",5
This flat iron is great. I can straighten my hair in half the time it used to take me with my old iron. My hair is soft and not dried out afterwards. I plan to purchase another one for a Gift soon. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a flat iron at a great price that does a great job.,5
Way exceeds my expectations! My hair is so smooth and it curls great also. Love the hair serum that came with it also!!,5
Very happy with this straightener I've used the chi for ten years and I was on to my 4th one I thought I would give something else a try. I'm very happy. My only complaint is it tugs t my hair a bit and some hair can get easily caught and pulled in it but overall great product for unruly hair,4
I have gone through so many hair straightens through my life. When I found the HSI I fell in love with reviews and didn't hesitate to order it!Once I got it I didn't hesitate to straighten my hair. I have a full head of extensions sewen in with my real hair here in there to blend more. Not only did this wonderful hair straighten blend my hair VERY well with my extensions it also made my extensions look brand knew after running it through them. I love this hair straightener so much!!,5
Product works very well for price. I have not owned a straightener for myself before. Decided to buy my own after I  started to borrow my daughters. I think I like hers a little more but it was more expensive.,4
I loved the product. It flattens your hair really quick. what i liked the most is how healthy my hair looks!,5
"This is the best Flat iron I have ever bought.1.-The price is Great.2.-Leaves my hair Awesome.3.-Come with a sample of ""Argain Oil"" that Protects my Hair and leaves it Shiny.4.-They Have the most Amazing Customer Service.I will Buy Again.",5
"I tried many straighteners, but very few worked for me. This one works very well, I am more than satisfied with it. I don't even take thin sections of hair (I have a lot of hair and little patience)and it does a great job very quickly, love it!",5
"This product is great! The price is right and the product works flawlessly, I have had the same flat iron for years now, so it was time for a new one. Skeptical at first, but I am slowing loving it more and more! Great product for the price!!",4
I saw this product listed on in a magazine as a 'best products of 2012. The product works great and straightens my hair in half the time than with my old one. It also heats up really fast. I am really happy with it.,5
"I started using HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch a few weeks ago and I couldn't be happier! I have soft African American hair that is permed, However, because my hair is so thick it has been abit difficult to find myself a straightener to tame my thick hair! It got my hair bone straight and even comes with a sample of argan oil which smells really nice and makes my even softer. I do wish I had a bigger sample. It also gets really hot at the top of the straightener so be careful!As if the straightener itself wasn't great enough, it also curls my hair the way I want too. Its almost as if I've left a salon! The only thing I'd complain about is the fact that it gives off a burnt smell if put on the max heat but other then that, I would recommend this straightener to anyone, especially those women who have hair like mine ! This straightener was worth the hassle! and the customer service was even better!",5
I purchased this straightener as a gift for my brother's girlfriend.  It was a great deal and it had great reviews. The product arrived very fast. She loves this straightener and says it works very well. I may have to get one of my own too.,5
"I received this product on Oct. 31st and it has worked wonders.  I have thick/unmanageable hair and have always had a hard time with certain cuts or styles.  I have owned 1 hair straightener before and needed another flat iron, one that would better manage my hair.  So far, this product has made straightening my hair easy and has cut my time by more than half.  I had never heard of HSI, and now that I own their product, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good bargain.Thank you.",5
"I bought this hair straightener for my wife. She has long, thick, curly hair. Although she has never used a hair straightener before, she can straighten her hair easily and fast with this device. In general, she is more than satisfied with it. Amazon also did a great job, it arrived well packed and very fast.",5
"I have very thick, curly, course hair and this iron did very well. Took about an hour for the entire procedure (my hair is shoulder length) which I thought was excellent considering other irons usually take at least 2 hours or more.It comes with a nice carrying case and box, and a glove in case your hands can't stand the heat.Warms up quickly and has a status/indicator light that changes colors when it's ready to use.Hair came out super straight and soft, and lasted a long time without frizzing or curling, even in the rain and moisture.Would recommend this iron. Nice professional style without having to pay the high cost.",5
"I have only usedit twice since it arrived but so far i love it. It is exactly like the one i bought for my mother at he mall for like 90 dollars. Identical except for the name on it and the GFI plug.  I am going to make sure i register it just in case something happens but so far i like it.  the oil stuff is nice smells good, I am not using the glove i see no point in that.",5
"I have fine baby hair- it straightens well but pulls a bit on my hair, I wish it was a bit smoother. Good for price, and if you have thick, curly hair is would probably straighten well, just be gentle!",4
"I love the extra long cord that is on the flat iron.  I do not feel like I am connected to the electrical outlet in my bathroom.  The iron is not heavy, I had rotator cuff surgery and have trouble holding a hair dryer, but this does not hurt me at all.",5
"The product is great because my daughter was looking at some other product the price range was crazy expensive.  I thought it was over priced.  So, I was looking around and I found this from Amazon.  The price is reasionable and it came with its cover, and glove.  It heats up very quickly and works great!!  I recommand to anyone who is looking for a flat iron.  My daughter loves it.",5
I for a long time thought flat ironing wasn't for me.  I have wavy hair and I like it wavy.  The problem has been that over the years as my gray is coming in the waves don't work together anymore and it ends up looking frizzy sometimes instead of controlled.My hair stylist used a flat iron one day to put in a wavy flipped look and it blew my mind!  I had thought flat irons were just for stick straight hair.  I decided to get this item because I need to have a bit more control over my hair for work sometimes and look more polished.It heats up really quickly and the styling process is really smooth and easy.  I look really professional and well-groomed now as my hair is actually behaving itself.  I waited a long time to buy one because initially I thought I would have to get a really expensive one.  I was delighted to find this one that was so affordable.  It really works well and at a much better price.I'll be using it a lot!  Thanks!,5
Great on the hair with little work.  Keeps the wave out of hair and makes it straight. Good for any hair length.,5
"What an amazing tool.  I can't compare it to another iron, because I've never used one before this.  It has transformed my unruly, frizzy hair.  I never thought I'd be able to handle ironing all this hair, but, like magic, I did it, without any problems.  I look like a completely different person, with hair I always wished I had.  I'm buying a back-up at this price.  Incredible product.  Heat glove is a must.",5
Love love love!!!!! These are amazing! I flat ironed two of my friends hair with these and the result...flawless!(along with my Leo of course lol) but great product totally worth $300 but they are only 40$..what a steal!,5
"I'd never heard of this brand before and noticed it when searching for flat irons on Amazon.. I got this because my CHI just wasn't doing the job and it got great reviews and the price was right.. This flat iron straightens my thick, frizzy, horse's mane hair like a champ! Very happy with it! And the sample oil the comes with it smells amazing and makes my hair super soft..",5
"Great service, fast delivery and product is wonderful. I,ll be ordering another for a Xmas gift which i,ve already tryed on this person. She loved the results.HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch",5
"After three AWFUL flat irons that caught my hair, were hard to handle or left multiple little burns on my hands, this HSI flat iron has been a wonderful change.  I researched many flat irons and was ready to spend over $100 if I could just find one that worked well. I have been very happy with this HSI model after working with it for two weeks.  It is easy to both use and put down, has not caught my hair and I have not been burned!  It works for straightening my bangs and getting rid of unwanted waves.  A great product.",5
"I absolutely love this straightner, I have used several others and they do not compare. I recommend this product to anyone who uses a straightner, the little bottle of Argan oil, I received works great also, I love how my hair looks very shiny and is manageable.",5
"This is the best straightener I have ever used and you can't beat the price! I have used all price points in the past (Chi to Remington) and this is my favorite.  I have very thick, long hair and this takes me half the time that it normally takes.  The only downside is that there is no automatic turn off if you forget to turn it off - so be careful! All in all, I highly recommend this flat iron.",5
"After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to risk buying this flat iron. I have fine color treated hair and always worry about damage from blow drying and straightening my hair. Right away I felt this was a high quality flat iron (didn't feel light weight or of cheap materials). I like that it has a textured finish and is easy to hold on to. It doesn't catch or pull hairs as I'm straightening which is a big plus. I wasn't sure about the Argan oil because I thought it might weigh down my hair, but it's actually very light and makes my hair silky smooth. I love the way it makes my hair feel. All that, along with the included bag and glove, for such a reasonable price, makes me a very satisfied customer!",5
I have used it a few times and so far it is great! The company and customer service have also been great!,5
Great product at a great price ensuring great customer service. Full satisfied. Recommend to everyone.5 star in customer satisfaction. The product arrived on time.,5
Love this straightener! Cost me far less than my CHI & heats up faster & gets my hair as smooth as silk!,5
"This ia wonderful well built & easy to use hair straightner.  It works well with all hair types.  The product looks, feels, & performs like an item with a much larger price tag.  I am glad I bought it & would recommend it to all who are interested in straightening hair with an excellent product.",5
"My daughters both said how happy they were with this straightener. One of them used to use a CHI straightener and she said that this one was every bit as good as, if not better, than the CHI. The price was certainly better! The iron heats quickly and works great. Would not hesitate to purchase another.",5
My hair has never looked better!  I tried it for the price and was thrilled to see it was a good deal and good quality.,5
"I love this flat iron. It reaches an extremely high temperature (410 I believe) which is hard to find in most flat irons. I comes in attractive packaging with a heat-resistant glove and a product called Argan oil, which I use as thermal protection for my hair. It arrived as estimated, just as described. I'm very satisfied and would recommend this to everyone.",5
"A great product at a great price. You should try this before buying one of those expensive overpriced Chi irons. This flat iron works just as well, in my opinion.",5
"I purchased this iron from the seller Blue Novelties for those who would like to know.I had never heard about this iron before, but I am so happy with it. I have 3C curls with a LOT of frizz and this iron gets my hair the straightest it's EVER been in one pass! Yes it has to reheat for half a second every now and then, big whoop. It took 20 minutes to flat iron my hair where it used to take over 2 hours! On top of that, the company was so nice, mine was missing the argan oil, they replied to me within 3 hours on a sunday which was a holiday! Not only are they replacing my missing argan oil, but they're sending me a second bottle of argan oil at no charge. To those of you complaining about the company, you should just email them.The floating plates are 100% ceramic tourmaline. They don't tug or rip at your hair. It heats up a little slow, however, this iron makes straightening my curly crazy hair so fast that doesn't even matter. My only dislike of this iron is that the temperature dial isn't labeled all the way around, you kinda have to guess, and it's a little hard to get at.Seriously for $39.99 (price I paid) for such a high quality flat iron, how can you go wrong?",5
"I had never heard of HSI, but I'm glad I came across this product! This straightener is inexpensive and works much better than any I've had before.  It heats up quickly and leaves my hair silky, smooth, and straight without snagging or pulling my hair. It even smoothes out my frizzy split ends! Great product!!",5
"Love the dial a temperaturenon this iron!  My hair is very fine, this iron let's me adjust the heat to a lower temp!",5
I have never had a one inch flat iron but I wanted one that i could curl my hair with. I have used it quite a few times and I love it so far!! I bought it because it was such a good deal! I am very satisfied. :),5
"Im changing my original review because after owning this straightener for 8 months and taking very good care of it, one of the plates cracked in half as I used it and it took a chunk of hair off.  Not please with that at all!",2
I have had this Flat iron for a little over a year & it is starting to not get as hot as it used too.  I guess you get what you pay for...,3
Haven't used it much but so far so good! Just hope it doesn't start giving split ends. Those suck! Wahoo,5
"I recieved my straightner right on time. It came packaged in a nice box. In the box was the straightner, a cute red silky carry case, a heat protectant glove, and a little bottle of the HSI hair oil. I read a few reviews before I bought this product and there where a few bad but over all there were more positive then negitives. I went out on a limb and tried this product, I must say this is the best straightner I ever had!! I have curly long relitively thin hair that usually starts to curl up during the day under certain weather conditions! I have not had this problem since using the HSI straightner! My hair literally stayed straight for three days without me retouching it! I was so amazed! This is a very good buy. If you go on the website (hsiprofessionals.com) this straightner is I believe $90. I would 100% recommend this item to any and every friend!! Buy you won't be dissapointed!",5
This flat iron is top quality. I love that you can control the temperature. It works quickly to straighten or even add curls and wave to my beautiful head of hair.,5
"I am extremely happy with how well this flat iron works.  I was in need of a high quality flat iron, because my hair is very thick, course and wavy.  After reading the reviews, I thought this would be perfect for me and it has definately met my expectations.  It takes me half the time it did with my discount store iron for the same price.  I may just order another one to keep on hand!",5
"There is no digital temp screen - so you never actually know what the temp of the iron. It's also weirdly heavy, but it handles smooth. It's a thin design which is nice for getting your own back of the head and the cord is nice and long.",4
This is the best straightener I have ever owned! I am so impressed with it and the price is absolutely amazing. The item arrived even sooner than expected as well. Super impressed and pleased. Definitely recommend.,5
A true professional product in every aspect.  Well accessorized and sturdily packaged.  Equal to those found in high end salons.,5
I have curly hair. With this hair flat iron i can have straight hair in less than 30 minutes. It doesnt  burn your hair. It leave your hair really soft and healthy. I use  the argan oil treatment when i use the flat iron. They are fantastic together.,5
This is an AWESOME product.  It is of great quality and priced extremely well. It heats up quickly and leaves hair feeling silky.  Well worth the cost.,5
"Better than I could have hoped for!!  Best flat iron that I have ever purchased. It heats up super fast and leaves hair smooth and silky, can even and a flip up or down for flare. Shipped and rec'd within 3 days.  If your thinking about purchasing this iron, do it - you'll be extremely glad you did!!",5
This hair straightener works great and was a great deal at the price.  Got this for my girlfriend who has extremely thick hair and it works great on it.,5
"Trying a new straightener is pretty scary for me. I have naturally very curly hair that is almost impossible to tame. Since it is winter and I don't have to deal with the humidity, it was time to invest in a new straightener. I saw the crazy number of great reviews, I gave this a shot.My mom actually said to me ""how did you get your hair so straight??"" I knew then that I made the right choice. I was prepared to pay $150, but received the same quality for a student's budget.Perfect purchase!",5
I have thick hair and its very poofy when i don't put product in it. this straightner makes it so much easier to tone it down. Love it so glad i bought it. Worth the price :),4
This was one of the gifts I bought for my wife's birthday and she really loves it.She uses this every morning and she looks fantastic.,5
"This is a great straightener! It works quickly and really smooths and takes the frizz out. I love that you can adjust the temperature depending on the texture of your hair. My hair is long and wavy to curly (loose curls) and it smooths it in about 5 minutes. I have used cheap hair straighteners, but now I have learned it is worth it to spend more on a salon-quality product!",5
I purchased this flat iron after having a chi iron for about 8 years. I researched reviews on this product and made the decision to buy it based on the reviews and the price. I have been very satisfied with my flat iron after using it for about one week. My hair is much easier to style and manage. I would buy this product again.,5
This product worked great.  Easy to hold and easy to use.  The glove that comes with it helps so you do not burn your hand.,5
"it doesn't take long to heat and does an amazing job. i have thick, frizzy, curly hair and this straightens it in 30 minutes compared to my usual hour and a half with a $40 store bought straightener. i only have to go over one section of hair once! a steal for only $39.99 on sale!",5
"We are very pleased with the HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. Three of us use it, and it turns stubborn waves and very tight curls to wonderfully straight and shiny. There is no frizzing with the product. It works far better than our other iron straighteners. No regrets buying this one!",5
It is true what other reviewers said that the style holds for days!  I have very dry hair so only wash my hair every couple of days.  I can go 4 days and my hair is more protected than with other flat irons.,5
"This straightener works great! A lot better than the one I had before, and it's a great price for the quality! It made my hair pin straight and soft. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product -would recommend if",5
"This is my first flat iron. I have always used my curling iron to straighten my hair, then to curl it. Boy was I missing the boat. This flat iron is perfect. I have curly, wavy, frizzy hair. This flat iron leaves my hair straight, shiny and manageable. I am amazed at how quickly it works, and I do not have to use it at its highest setting. The price was right too. I had seen so many flat irons at much higher prices which made me doubt how good this one could be, but its not always the most expensive item that is the best. I would definitely recommend this product.",5
I am very pleased with this product.  I had bought a chi the last time and paid #100.00 for it.  It burned out quickly.  Love this one.,5
After receiving this straightener as I was using it I loved it because it straightens my hair so nice and leaves it so smooth. My hair has never been so straight i recommend this tool for any type of hair and i hope you love it as much as i do.,5
My daughter LOVES it!  She said it works AWESOME! It works like it said it would.  Leaves her hair nice and straight.,5
"I am in love with this straightener!  It is definitely professional salon quality.  It gets very hot quickly, and I only need to run it through my hair once to straighten it.  I couldn't believe how amazing the price was considering the original retail price.  I love this straightener and am so glad I got it!",5
"I love this straightener. I asked for it for my birthday and was surprised to see it. I have very, very fine, but soft hair. It reduced my frizz and springy dead ends drastically. I had a cheap straightener before and now will never buy any other brand again. Love this! (Hate the oil that came with, but the red satin case is amazing :)!)",5
I took the plunge and bought a straightener from amazon. So glad I did. I love the product. I have a house full of girls who all use it along with me. very good product. described accurately. very pleased with the straightener.,5
I have tried several flat irons and none. Of them compare to this product . It leaves my hair soft and silky for days ! Also I usually had to straighten my hair daily cuz it would frizz up not with this one as I said keeps your hair straight till you wash again . I get so many compliments on my hair now :),5
Wow awesome iron for the price you pay..heats up fast and leaves my hair silky smooth ..so far I love it,5
"I ordered the HSI Flat Iron because I was in the hunt for a nice flat iron and with the reviews on the HSI I was excited to order it! I used it today for the first time and LOVE it. It makes my hair soft, silky and shiny. I did use the sample oil that came with it and love that as well! The girls at work can't get over how beautiful my hair looks!! I purchased this product thru Amazon, it was simple and easy and it was delivered 2 day early. I am a Very Happy Women!!!!",5
"The flat iron works great. Heats up fast and leave my hair shiny, smooth and soft. It does not pull my hair how my past straightner did. So far a great product!",4
I am so surprised! I wasn't expecting much for the price but not only does it work great but it came with a case as well! Nice!,5
absolutely love it..best straighter i ever had.i would recommended this product to woman every where don't hesitate buy 1 today,5
"I am a low maintenance type of person when it comes to styling my hair.  I don't want to spend an hour or more trying to tame my fine but curly hair.  So when I decided to buy a new flat iron I was advised by more than one person that a CHI was the way to go.  However, I was hesitant for two reasons.  The first was the price, I refuse to spend a fortune on a hair styling tool that I won't use everyday.  And two, not everyone sings its praises. Upon reviewing customer reviews I saw that a lot of users were less than thrilled. So when I saw the HSI I decided the price was right and I must say I LOVE IT!!!  It heats up quickly and does as good a job as any flat iron found in professional salons.  It even comes with a glove to prevent burning your hand when handling newly ironed hair while the the tool remains cool to the touch.  And bonus: it comes with a sample bottle of Argan oil (which is fantastic). I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone who wants the great results without the exorbitant prices of its competitors or hard to handle tools that don't perform well.  The seller Blue Novelties is fantastic, shipped extremely fast and provided great customer service.  If you're on the fence hope this helps.",5
"I love, love, love this flat iron. I loved the results accomplished with this flat iron, My hair was nice,straight and flows beautifully. I have received nothing but compliments after using this flat iron. This product receives my Highest recommendation!",5
"Recently, my GHD flat iron died and I had to begin looking for a replacement.  As much as I liked my old flat iron, it was expensive and it did not last as long as I thought it should have.  I did not want a Chi because the last one I purchased began to break after two weeks.  So I began the process of trying to find a flat iron that provided quality without breaking my budget.  I found the HSI flat iron online and I was impressed with the price and with the amount of positive reviews.  I decided to purchase the flat iron and so far it has been a great decision.When I received the flat iron I was impressed with the quality of the iron and how sturdy it felt.  The temperature is easy to set and I like the cord because it does not seem to tangle.  I use the medium setting for my hair and the provided oil and my hair has been sleek and shiny every time I use it.  It works so efficiently that I actuallly get ready much sooner in the morning.My hair is fairly straight, just a little wavy, so the medium setting is sufficient for my hair.  As hot as this flat iron gets, I am sure it would work well even on the curliest of hair. I like this flat iron enough that I recommended it to my sister.  This flat iron works as well as any that I have used in the past and the pricing is fantastic.",5
"This is the greatest flat iron I have owned. I have naturally stick straight hair that tends to frizz, but this flat iron really cuts down on the frizz. I would highly recommend this product!",5
"I purchased the HSI flat iron for my daughter as a birthday present.  The price was fantastic, it arrived earlier than estimated, and the quality of the straightener was much better than any that I have previously purchased.  I loved that it also came with a 1 year warranty which other manufacturers do not always offer.  My daughter was so happy with it that I bought another for my other daughter for Christmas!",5
"When my GHD died after 2 years of use, I didn't feel like blowing another couple hundred dollars and decided to give the HSI a try based on all of the reviews. While I think it's a good value for the price I paid, it's not as good as my GHD was. My hair will often start to get waves an hour or two after I've straightened it with this HSI, which is something that did not happen with my previous GHD straightener. If you are looking for high quality results, I recommend the GHD. Otherwise, this is a cheaper alternative-- just know that the effect will not be the same.",3
"My daughter and I are very impressed with HSI's The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron 1"" Hair Straightener! This flat iron is just as good if not better than the Professional Paul Mitchell flat iron we are replacing it with, which cost me almost $200.00. I highly recommend this quality, fabulously priced item.",5
"From the reviews I read I thought it would be better than my chi, but it isn't. It doesn't get hot enough and it's heavier. I miss my chi!!!",3
"So easy to use.  Has become my favorite hair tool.  My 14 year old granddaughter loves it.  So glad I went ahead and ordered it.  Very professional, and it does what it is supposed to do.",5
I recently purchased the HSI flat iron and absolutely love it. I have curly thick hair and this flat iron works perfectly. It heats up quick and I don't have to constantly keep going through my hair to get it straight! Love love love!!! I recommend to anyone!,5
"Very happy with this item. First straightener I have purchased and have no issues with it.  Plates heat up very quickly, easy to hold, love it",5
"I've used many flat irons and this one does an excellent job for the price (I used a CHI iron before this one - equally good). Heats up quickly, lightweight, easy to use. Would definitely recommend to others.",5
I bought this item and love it.  It works so well and just glides off my hair without damaging it.  Would recommend it to anyone who wants straight hair.,5
I loveeeee these flat irons they are wonderful everytime i do my hair it looks like i came for the salon they are just perfect.HSI are they flat irons too buy believe me,5
Love this flat iron and the price was GREAT!  I have been looking for a new flat iron for a long time and this is exactly what I wanted.,5
BEST Flat iron I ever owned! Heats up quick! Long lasting results! Worth every penny! My hair stylist uses the Runway FHI and this works just as good in my opinion and costs much less,5
My daughter insisted on having this particular straightener for Christmas.  She is extremely picky about hair products so I'm sure this will be ideal!  The package arrived on time.  Although I have not opened the box (because it's a present)it is not crushed or damaged in any way.,5
"I had been buying inexpensive flat irons, and none of them gave me the results I always got when I went to the salon.  However I didn't want to spend $100 - $200 on a decent flat iron.  After reading the reviews of the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron, and saw it's low price, I decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did!  I have long hair, medium thickness, wavy hair.  I didn't have to turn this iron onto it's highest heat setting to get smooth, sleek, frizz free hair.  And where other irons made my hair feel and look like straw after using them, this iron only gave me beautiful, shiny hair.  An added bonus:  my hair stays beautiful for days, even after sleeping on it, so I don't have to iron it everyday.  I feel like I've won the hair lottery.  One of the best purchases I've made in a long time.",5
"This product is amazing! Let me just start off by saying that I am black with coiled hair. I've only ever gotten my hair done at the salon, but now that I am a college student, I've had to cut back. Well I first got the Remington purple ceramic flat iron, but it left my hair a bit poofy and the plates were only ceramic coats. So I tried my roommate's hsi tourmaline straightener. My hair came out great! It looked just like the salon finish that i'm used to! However I used heat protectant on my hair while blow drying it. But besides that, it came out amazing, the ionic ceramic plates keep your hair smooth and shiny and it gives you that bounce that we all love! I just bought my own right now and it will be here in 2 days! I'm so excited to do my hair!",5
"This product out performs any of my recent flat irons.  I actually dreaded flat ironing my hair every day, which I needed for one bubbled up spot on the back of my head.  Now, with my new iron, this is not a chore at all.  The iron is effective and efficient.  It leaves my hair much smoother than other irons I have used.  Now meeting my daily duty of flat ironing is not as discouraging to me. This is a great product!",5
"I'm Asian with really puffy hair, had been trying some different straighters, however, it never gave the look i want. the ""HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron"" actually gives me the style i want, my hair is smooth but not like flat. so far, with the price i paid for, I'm really happy with this item.",5
"I was very excited to try this, especially after reading all of the great reviews.  It works as well as everyone says it does.  This is now my favorite flat iron.  I have very thick, curly hair, but it  damages easily.  I'm able to get straight hair without the breakage, when I use this!!",5
"I bought one for myself last year and my daughters were always trying to snatch it, so I got them each one this year. WE LOVE IT! I'd bought a few irons before this one, but I won't need any but this one now...it works so nice!! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I definitely would!!",5
"I bought this after bleaching and dying my hair, resulting in an unmanageable poof after blow drying. I have thick, wavy to curly hairy that prior to bleaching wasn't particularly hard to straighten. It takes out the frizz and keeps it smooth until I wash it. It doesn't make my hair pin-straight, but having never really used a flat iron prior to this, I'm not sure my hair type is even capable of that. All in all, I'm satisfied with the product.",4
"I received mine two days ago. I LOVE the oil and the flat iron! It heats up quickly and works in an incredible way! I have my own way of straightening my hair. I use a J&D; Heat Straight Brush and the flat iron at the same time. I would clamp my hair and have the flat iron above it... then I go downward. The brush will keep your hair straight and separated for the flat iron to heat it nicely.The location of the temp. knob and on/off switch is not something people like but I think it's good. Because our hand is constantly slipping on the outside, we might switch it off or turn up/down the heat on accident. I wished it came with two gloves because I couldn't decide which hand I should use it for. The straightener is hot and so is the hair. I used it on my straighter hand since the iron will ALWAYS be hot while your hair will cool down quick. The iron heats very quick. Mine reached max temp. in under a minute. The cord is workable. The argan oil is great. The pouch it comes with is awesome and thick.I use to get Japanese hair perm once a year. I didn't do it this year and I really wanted my straight and non-frizzy hair. I also like tying my hair and untying it without a hair band print too so I decided I needed to get a flat iron to make up. I have dry, semi-wavy and puffy hair. Too much volume. It gets frizzy and nasty to work with so I always tie my hair. I got fed up and since it's almost Winter, I would love to have my straight hair back/have my hair down. I can also use this to curl my hair, which is neat! Sometimes having curls isn't bad!I wasn't sure if I should get this or not because it seemed odd to me that it is originally $300 but it's $40 on Amazon. I compared it to top flat irons and other plates (this is a Tourmaline... so it's different in how it works and heats). This had many reviews but you can never go with that. I watched videos. After extensive research, I convinced myself to get it. It's $40. If it can work like the CHI that I'm use to, then it is worth it. I cannot talk about the longevity but for anything.. as long as you take care of it, not throw it around, or do anything bad to it, it should last for a very long time.TL:DR - It's worth the $40. If you cannot afford the expensive $150-400 ones, get this. An inexpensive and expensive one will break anyway, you might as well go with this one. You'll save tons of money for the same result. Every flat iron will damage your hair one way or another. You just need to use specific oil before working with our hair to protect it ""some"".  If this isn't straightening your hair enough, you're probably doing something wrong. From my knowledge, the science behind it, the making of the tourmaline, at 410 degrees it should straighten any hair. Let's hope it doesn't fry it though. Different hair requires different temperature. 410 is too high for my hair.",5
"I, like the others, have never heard of this brand. However, I'm glad I decided to make the purchase. This flat iron is made of very high quality...very sturdy and it gets pretty hot. Also, it arrived very quick and I love the heat protector bag! Thank you!! Aand, they have great customer service. Don't hesitate to buy. You won't be sorry!!",5
"When using the HSI The Styler Ceramic tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch, my hair is just as smooth and silky as when I leave the salon. I was very skeptical because I have always spent a lot of money on my flat irons but decided to give this one a try, I'm so glad that I did. It does not damage my hair like my expensive flat iron does. I am very impressed with this product.",5
I got this for my daughter after her Chi ($100) stopped working after 8 months.  This works better for her than the Chi and she has very thick wavy hair.  It also comes with oil that she likes as well as a heat glove.  It is really professional quality at a great price.  I just ordered one for myself as well.,5
This was a great purchase for me. It arrived promptly. I was looking for a flat iron that did not cause static in my hair. This flat iron leaves my thick hair silky smooth and I love it. I use it with the Argon oil which I purchased locally for less and it works great and smells wonderful (the oil). I would definitely reccomend this Flat iron for a great hair styling tool.,5
I love these flat irons. The weight is just right!  The flat iron gives my hair such a gloss as if I used some kind of sheen. I will most likely buy another pair as I like to have two of everything and I have two daughters who may want to use them!,5
"I like this straightener a lot.  Works well, doesn't have any edges to snag hair like some do.  I love the glove that comes with it, really helps me to get through the straightening without burning my hands.",4
"I have terrible hair.  Frizzy. Unruly. Every day is a bad hair day for me.  I just tried this flat iron, and I can't believe that my hair is straight, shiny and manageable.  It really works.  And if I can use it, anybody an use it.",5
My daughters love this straightener. It is not too big so it fits their hands nicely. And it has an adjustable heat control which is nice because my daughters have very different types of hair. But it works great for each of them individually. Came with the heat glove too and nice storage bag which was a bonus. Happy with this purchase...and we got it at a great price.,5
I am amazed at the high quality of this ceramic flat iron!!  Heats quickly and has various temperature settings.  The price was FANTASTIC also!  Love it!,5
"The description for this item gives the impression that it comes with oil, mine did not. I like that it the it works at 110 and 240 V, but was surprised that the transformer is not labeled that way, and only the package. My first test indicates that  it works as described.",4
"I bought this hair straightener after reading so many positive reviews, and they were definitely accurate!  My hair looks smooth and shiny when I use it.  I've been using it a couple months now and the ends of my hair are not split or fried like other straighteners I've used before.  I think it helps that it has the adjustable heat option.  The straightener also came with a case and a small bottle of Argan oil, which I had never used, but absolutely love!  Great product at a really good price.",5
"I love this straightener. It leaves my hair really straight and it takes very little time to do it. My hair stays shiny! I recommend reading the instructions and adjusting the temperature according to your hair type, of course like with any hair product that puts heat on your hair you need to be careful. Haven't tried to use it to curl my hair yet but overall I love this straightener.",5
"I bought this after my second Chi just quit working.  I was a little skeptical as I have bought a lot of different flat irons and none of them have worked as well as the Chi.  This one does!  I have very thick, course hair and couldn't believe how well this straightened.  It works the same as my Chi for half the price!",5
"Does a really nice job! I can straighten my hair in record time, and it leaves my hair feeling soft and conditioned,instead of dried out. The plated don't leave my hair overly warm either, which is awesome. Heats up quickly, and has a great location for the controls which prevent you from accidentally changing the settings as you straighten your hair. Overall, very pleased. :)",4
I purchased this product to replace my CHI which I liked very much.  The HSI straightens my kinky hair very well!! I love that there is a temperature control on it as my CHI did not have one.  Using the HSI flat iron makes easy work of doing my hair!,4
"I am not one to write customer reviews, but this product was so amazing I felt I should. As soon a you open the box and feel it you can tell it's a high quality product. It's a little heavier than most flat irons, but its excellent quality! My hair has never look or felt this soft, shiny, and smooth! It gets hot really fast. It's the best iron I have ever used hands down. I've recommended it to my friends and family!",5
I\ve hesitated a lot before purchasing this iron. The thing is that I am from Europe and have been living here in CA for only 2 months. I am going to Europe net month. So I needed item that would work both in the USA and Europe. I found this item and doubted if it would work in Europe with 220V. So I decided to try.Great!!!! I got Worldwide edition (thoght i spent only 39USD:))))Recommend to anyone!!!,5
This is a top notch flat iron for the best price. If you are questioning that it must not work that great for the low price... think again. I have had a lot of flat irons over the years and it is as good as the much higher priced competitors. Don't hesitate to buy!!!!,5
"My hair is naturally curly and very thick and this flatiron got my hair very straight and the argon oil that cam with it gave my hair a nice shine. The heat protector glove worked really well because my hair holds heat, so the gloved protected my hand. when I used this flat iron my hair stayed straight all day and did not get frizzy at all. I would very much recommend this flat iron.",5
Works wonders on my hair I love it! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a flat iron. I like it better than my chi.,5
"Item doesn't get too hot like other straighteners, although it took me a while to find the on/off button.... I do love it!",5
"I use a straightener daily mostly for curling under my hair. My hair is naturally thin and straight and I don't like using curling irons because they can sometimes crease your hair.This product was just what I was looking for. My hair, though straight, has a difficult time holding a curl especially if I decide to flip my hair out. With this iron, I can change the heat settings appropriately to ensure the curl will be held. Since the iron is ceramic there is even heat distribution and the overall final hair style looks clean.The only thing that I do not like about the product is that the on/off switch and heat dial are on the inside next to the ceramic plates. It is sometimes awkward to turn the device on and off, but I guess it could be nice that you don't accidentally turn it off mid-use. That is really the only thing that I don't care for about the product, which is essentially minute.I'm not sure how this product would work on different hair textures and thicknesses, but from other reviews I read on here a lot of other customers seemed equally as pleased with the product.",4
"This is the first hair-straightener I've ever owned.  I visited my friend who had it, and I loved it, so I bought one of my own.  It heats up super fast.  The plates heat really evenly.  My hair looks great.",5
"I received my HSI  & I couldnt believe they were as great for the price. However I have been convinced you dont have to pay alot to receive a good product. I had been using CHI irons and was thinking about buying some FHI, however I am a new HSI user from here on out and I am telling all of my firends.",5
"I love this iron, and I am so glad that I bought it!  Not only does it straighten your hair, but makes it shiny as well!  And I used it to wave my hair too!  Highly recommended, and great price too! I love it so much that I bought my sister one too, and she loves it as well!JAN 23 Update-- So my sister's flat Iron is great, and still working, mine, however, is not anymore!  I rarely used mine, and now I have the last few days it does not heat up. I am wondering if I can get in touch with the company to exchange it.  I hope so.",5
I bought the flat iron as a gift. I am a prime member and was able to receive the iron in two days. That is very important for me. Great Job!,5
"I had to finally retire my CHI of close to 7 years and while doing my research for professional flat irons, I came across the HSI. My thinking was ""what the heck"", worst case scenerio I'm only out $40 if things don't work out.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a very nice iron for the money.  If you don't want to shell out the $100++ for other professional irons, this one works very well.  Is it as good?  That is a question I can not answer.  I can't really compare it to my CHI, as the CHI was starting to lose its heat midway through the ironing process, so it would not be a fair contest.  I feel this one does not go through the hair as smoothly as the CHI, but, it by no means snags my hair like I have read in other reviews.  For the $40 investment, I think this iron is a great deal and serves it's purpose very well.  This iron came quickly and the company that makes it appears to stand behind their product, so, I would most certainly purchase from them again and recommend this product to others.",4
I have only purchased cheap straighteners at the store that never really worked. I didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars for a hair styling product.  This straightener is priced well and it works.  Now my hair is as straight and shiny as if my hairdresser just styled it.  I would highly recommend this.  FYI my hair is slightly curly naturally and thin.,5
"This is a great flat iron that works great, especially for the price.  I had a much more expensive one that had an easier grip and left my hair softer, but I accidently melted that one on a vacation.  For the price, you can't beat this as a replacement.",4
"Product is average (2.5/5) at best. Got an extra half star because it makes my hair shiny, when I finally finish straightening it. This iron doesn't get hot enough to handle my thick, coarse South Asian hair. Even at the highest setting, I need to go over hair 2-3 times before getting the desired straightness. I would get the same result with an iron bought from a major retailer for half the cost. Haven't tried the Argan oil, which will make it easier to return. Don't bother with this iron if your hair is thick and on the coarser side.",3
"Works great whether you need a quick style over damp hair, or a shiny, sleek straightening. Happy with the product and VERY happy with the heat settings!",5
"love this iron!best purchase ever!... it heats up really fast nad it makes ur hair silky soft and smooth, it was worth the price i paid",5
"I am extremely pleased with my HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener. It is by far, the most efficient hair straightener I have purchased to date and I am able to do my hair in half the time I once was. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.",5
I really like this flat iron. I have had many before but this one is particularly good for the money. It has a very heavy construction and allows you to press the plates together completely which helps with the straightening process. It also gets very hot which is necessary for course hair like mine. Overall a great product at a great price!,5
"I LOVED this flat iron! Works great and is an awesome price! I loved so much I bought 3 other's for gifts. After a month or two, I started to notice a smell ONLY when I would straighten my hair. I ran myself crazy trying different shampoos to no avail. I asked my husband to smell my hair and he said it smelled like burnt hair. It dawned on me that the flat iron somehow was so hot it was burning my hair and leaving an odor. I've never had this with my other high end flat irons so it was the farthest thing from my mind. Unfortunately, this smell was driving me too crazy to use anymore and I'm back to using my Paul Mitchell.",3
I admit I bought this flat iron because the price was too great to not at least give it a try. I didn't expect much from it... but it works great!! I love that it doesn't grab my hair and it straightens my hair so fast!! I have lots of hair and usually hate dealing with straightening it because it takes so long but with this flat iron I actually feel like it is worth my time to style my hair!! The only thing this is missing is an auto shut off but otherwise it is well worth the money.,4
"I also have never heard of this company but purchased this flat iron after reading the other reviews.  I am glad I did.  Good quality product, well put together.  I would definitely recommend this product if you are considering a flat iron.  Also arrived quickly, two days before stated shipment date.  A+ for Amazon!Update:  After using this straightener for a couple weeks I have to say I love it.  I like the fact that I can set the heat at different settings.  I also like the way the oil that came with the straightener makes my hair look great.  I would buy this again and highly recommend.",5
Straightener really flatens hair.without cinging or damaging ends.. I have only used it for a week or so but is working.great so far,5
"I have very curly hair and have been using flat irons for about 10 years. My $100 iron recently broke and I started looking for a replacement.  I was skeptical on how well a flat iron at this price would work, but I read the good reviews and decided to give it a try. With as curly as my hair is, I always have to set an iron at the hottest heat level, but with this iron, the hottest level actually levels my hair too straight. (I like to leave some volume in my hair.) I've never had that type of problem before, the hottest level usually barely does the trick. It's great to be able to have such a range of powerful heat levels to control how straight I want my hair. Plus, I always wondered how some people with naturally textured hair get it so shiny after straightening it with heat, which normally damages the hair and leaves it on the dull and dry side. This product made me realize it has to do with the quality of the flat iron. This flat iron definitely delivers, surpasses my expectations, and gives me the freedom to style my hair in a lot of different ways.",5
Just received my flat iron. It works great. I am really happy with the flat iron. I also received a free sample of hair treatment. The Flatiron comes with its own bag.,5
"My teenage daughters love it. My daughter has very curly hair, hard to manage. Not anymore, this product is the best. She is happy with this product. Will buy two more next February 2013.Not telling anyone about this product until I buy two more then I will spread the Great news about it.",5
"This flat iron is beautiful!  Not relevant, but it is ;-).  It's comfortable to hold, east to use, and gets hot super quickly.  I cannot use it on the hottest setting even though I have very coarse Afican American hair because it just gets that hot.  This I'd a really efficient hit iron.  As soon as my nineteen year old niece got a look at it she said that she wanted the exact same one to replace her old flat iron.  I am do pleased with this purchase.  I compared the sample argon oil to my nieces argon oil of a different manufacturer and HSI's oil is much lighter, smother, and shinier.  I gave my niece the sample because I purchase the 4oz argon oil from HSI.",5
Heats up quickly. My hair is just below shoulder length and fairly thick and frizzy.  Using my previous straightener I would have to stop half way through and let it heat back up. The HSI maintains the heat well. I have only had this strightener a week and so far i really like it. Even my co- workers noticed a difference in my hair.  The swivel cord is a nice feature.,5
A great straightener.  The perfect size and works really well! I use it for curls and to straighten.  It's so much better than my old one.,5
"I am really happy with this product- especially for the price I paid for it. I had looked at the chi as well, but I'm trying to stay on a tighter budget. This straightener has really amazed me and people have complimented me on how my hair has looked great since I started using it over my old straightener. Definitely recommend.",5
"This is a great straightener!  This is the least amount of time that I have ever spent straightening my hair and with such great results!  I was worried because I had never heard of this company; but after reading the reviews, I went ahead and ordered it.  Definitely money well spent! Also, not important but a nice bonus, the packaging is amazing with the lovely travel pouch and glove to prevent burning your hand.  The argon oil was a nice bonus as well.  It is a tiny little bottle that goes a long way when used during straightening.  I have wanted to try argon oil for a while, but hate buying a container of product just to find out that I hate it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener!!",5
"The iron warms up very fast and works great! It comes with this neat glove to protect your hand from accidental burns and a pretty pouch to store the iron. This is the first time I bought a HSI brand item, but I would buy it again in a future with no hesiation. It is well worth it's price!",5
"I ordered this item for my wife as a birthday gift. I figured she would just like it, but after she actually used it, she loves it. Shipping was very fast, I am impressed ! !",5
I really love my new hsi . It gets my hair really straight. I would recommend the hsi to any one.,5
The reviews online were very helpful. I recieved my flat iron very quickly. It was shipped and packaged well and the box was in perfect condition. I opened it and used it right away and I was very impressed. It holds my hair strand much tighter than my previous flat iraon and my hais was so shiny! I plan on ordering another one for my daughter for Christmas!,5
"This product has much quality. It's easy to handle, heats very well, and did an amazing job on my hair. The Argan oil  effects on my curly hair made me search high and low for more of it. It has a silk like effect on my curls and tamed my hair very well. It works very well with the flat iron. I am so happy I didn't spend a lot for this item. This product is proof that you don't have to spend major bucks on quality. I believe this product is very competitive and I plan to have this product and the HSI Argan Oil for a long time. I am highly pleased!",5
"This product was everything I'd hoped it would be. I'm a former Chi user but I am extremely pleased with my HSI. The seller was extremely efficient, was delivered before I was expecting it which was great!",5
I recently ordered this straightener since my Chi broke. I read the reviews and the price was right so I wanted to try it. So far it is better than the Chi! I'm very happy with my purchase!,5
Works great.Makes for great straightner for on the road. Daughter used when home and she liked it and she's picky about her hair. Wish would come out with 2 inch version.,5
Followed instructions by other users (even watched a youtube video) and got hair that was smooth and bouncy that lasted for 4 days (before I washed it). I do not know how long it will work this well but so far above satisfied with the product.,5
"I was so excited to get this flat iron! I had used Friction Free and T 3 flat iron before. Now I only need to use less 10 minutes to straighten my hair.After I used this flat iron, my hair became straight and silky. This HSI flat iron is the cheapest flat iron I ever paid,but worksExcellent!! I also  like it  because it is 110V - 220V so I can bring it to my country to use!!",5
"The product got in perfect shape, in the time that the company said that would get. It is really good and I am glad that I chose this store.",5
"I purchased the HSI Ionic flat iron hair straightener because my wife dropped hers and broke it. She is now happy that she did because she say this is the best thing that could have happened, it's a great product which saves time whenever she has to do her hair. She loves it.",5
"I love this straightener!  It is high quality, heats up quickly, and straightens easily. I have wavy, frizzy hair and this straightener makes my hair so smooth.  I have had several people ask me if I did something new to my hair since I started using it.  A great buy!!",5
"I'm Asian with a thick long frizzy black hair. It has always been a challenge fixing my crazy frizzy hair. Every morning when I get ready for work, I normally spend about 45 minutes ironing my hair straight. With HSI, believe it or not it only takes me 15 minutes at most. It saved me time and my hair is not just straight but soft too. I couldn't ask for more. I am a very happy and satisfied customer!And by the way, HSI customer service is awesome too. I sent an email inquiry and got back to me that same day. Great product plus great customer service- can't beat that!",5
Great product at a really great price. I will be ordering again. I have already advised friends and family where to shop :-),5
"Fantastic product, just what I ordered and at a completely reasonable price. Very happy with my purchase! I would highly recommend it to anyone.",5
"My previous flat iron was a CHI, which worked well for a while but never really handled the thick, wavy hair that I have.  Since I had not heard of the HSI, I felt I was taking a chance, but liked the reviews I read on it.  I am so glad I did!  I am very pleased with the performance of this flat iron.  It is less bulky than the CHI, more heat settings, a swivel cord that doesn't get tangled,and easier to use. With my CHI I had to get the hair in the iron, then hold it with both hands to put enough pressure to straighten it.  No so with this HSI - one hand does it! The glove is a great addition, as is the HSI Argan Oil.  Thank you for offering a wonderful product at a wonderful price!",5
"I love this straightener! It is amazing. I have owned it for a couple of months now (October 2012). I have very long (down to my waist) wavy hair that tangles. This straightener works just as well as salon straighteners that my hair stylist uses. I recently bought a Regis straightener, which broke about 6 months after using it (daily). It was over $100. This straightener is a much better price and works just as well, if not better. I will keep using it. If it breaks like the Regis straightener, I will update this review, but I doubt that it will. I usually use Unite 7 detangler (best leave in conditioner ever!), brush any tangles out, blow dry my hair for added volume, then straighten.",5
"My go to straightener!! Wouldn't use anything else!!! As soon as I tried it, I loved it!! It doesn't pull and it doesn't dry my hair",5
I just got this item yesterday and have used it twice. I'M IN LOVE! What an amazing flat iron I used a chi before this and read the reviews on here. So for the price I figured why not?? Well my hair looks and feels so silky and looks amazing! I love this item and would buy it again!,5
I love how easy I can curl my hair with this! And straighten it too. Better than my chi. I also love the case that comes with it because it's great for travel.,5
"I wanted to love this iron. I read the reviews and decided it was time to finally replace my $25 drugstore straightener with a more professional one. When it arrived, I used it right away. Well, I tried to. It took 15 minutes to fully heat up to 410. I always use the hottest setting on flat iron because my hair is very thick and wavy. When it finally heated up, I used it on one strand of hair, and the light turned red so it could heat back up. It took 3 minutes to heat up again. I tried resetting, turning off, turning on, giving it a day to calm down, etc. Nothing work. I contacted the seller and they said it sounded like a defective product. I received a free replacement within a few days. Unfortunately, it had the same exact defect. I was frustrated and sent both back for a full refund. I would give this 0 stars but the customer service was great and based on all the great reviews, it's obvious I got two bad irons out of hundreds and thousands of good ones. I just didn't have the time or energy to keep getting it replaced anymore, so I'll stick with my cheap but reliable Remington.",3
"First off the HSI Flat Iron does work really well especially for the price. I could get my hair straightened in 10mins compared to my old flat iron that would take about 30mins. The HSI heats up almost immediately and really does curl your hair well. The Hair oil treatment is amazing but it is a very small sample that gets used in a couple days. Also the HSI gets so hot that sometimes when using it on my hair the handle area would get pretty hot as well and I didn't like that but it is still do able. I have owned mine for about 7months now and I am having to replace it because it was dropped several times from my mother in law, so one of the ceramic plates started to come up and would snag my hair when I would use it. With that said be careful about dropping it because when the ceramic plate does come up it hurts too bad to use the HSI all together. I reordered another one and expecting it today!",4
"This is a great product. Delivery was on time and I got more than I thought when I opened the box. I have a glove to eliminate burning my hand, a small bottle of oil, and a case. I was very happy to receive all this and the price was excellent.",5
"I purchased this flat iron because it had really good reviews on Amazon as well as other web sites.  Amazon definitely had the best price.  I received the item in 2 days with Prime shipping and I was not disappointed.  The flat iron feels very well constructed, not lightweight like some others I have looked at.  The first time I used it was amazing results.  I have thick, very naturally curly hair.  And I do mean a lot of curls! This iron straigtened my hair perfectly and in most places with just one try.  I would definetly recommend this product and it even came with a carry bag and heat proof glove.  Very nice!!",5
"I purchased this to replace my dying Chi.  I was skeptical at first (I mean, the cost was so much less!) but the positive reviews made me take a chance on it.  Wow - am I glad I got this one!I have very curly hair that tends to get frizzy a lot. Think Monica in Barbados in ""Friends"".  That's me.  My previous straighteners (including the Chi) would straighten my hair fine, but then, whenever it was a humid day, I'd end up with ""puffy straight"" hair later in the day.  That's not the case with this HSI.  My hair looks smooth and silky for 2 days straight!  I use it after I blow dry my hair (and you should see that frizz ball...) and then I touch up my hair the next day with it, since I wash my hair every other day.  The straightened style stays that way for those 2 days.  It's awesome.  I am also able to use this HSI to flip my hair out at the ends, if I feel like it, or flip it down, if I want a different look.I like the temperature settings on it as well, my other straightening irons did not have that.  It was either on or off, you had no control over the temperature.  When I am just touching up the ends, I don't need to have it on scorching hot, so I like this feature.I love this thing - try it, you won't be disappointed.  I won't be going back to a Chi anymore.  The seller was great, too - delivery was faster than promised!  Bonus!",5
"This iron is the best iron I have ever owned. I have very long curly 3b-c African American hair. This iron gives me the bone straight look like most professional grade irons, however it leaves the hair worlds shinier than all of my previous irons! With other irons I have had to push down on the plates very hard to get my hair bone straight but this one it does it in one or two simple passes. No more pressing down and burning my fingers! Not a fan of the oil that came with it but my hair is strange with products. But, the glove and satin travel case are an added bonus. Stop wasting money on expensive irons and just get this one! Now a huge fan of HSI! Thanks!",5
"Got the HSI Styler Ceramic Hair Straightener for my daughter.  She loves it. She have very thick hair, and it took her less than half the time to straighten her hair, she only had to do it once to get the results she wanted.  She has been using it almost daily, and hasn't seen any hair breakage.  I will be ordering another one for my other daughter.",5
"This is a top quality flat iron, full size but not unwieldy. Heats up quickly. Love the different heat settings. I can style my hair very quickly with this iron as it effectively flattens or curls my hair in a minimum of time. I have lots of fine somewhat flat hair and this helps me add some fullness and get rid of the waves I do not want while shaping my style just the way I do want.",5
When I got this flat iron I plugged it in and it immediately heated up fast and I could see that it was working.  I decided to try this on my daughters hair first.  We have really coarse thick hair and so I was curious how it would compare to our CHI.  It has a smooth pull down like the CHI with no pulling of the hair.  As fair as the straightening part it is a step down from the CHI.  We still use this weekly and will continue to use it.  It is a great flat iron for the price.,4
This straightener works so well and is really cheap!  I bought and returned a much more expensive model because this one is amazing.  Would definitely recommend.  Comes with a nice case for travelling as well.,5
"I have been using irons to straighten my hair for 12 years, my hair is curly, long and course. This iron works on my hair air dryed over night, it is able to make it sleek without frying. Non snagging on the hair as well. I am pleased with this purchase. I have had a CHI, a Remington and other smaller name generic irons; to compare this is just as good as CHI for less $$.",5
"this is amazing, i straightened my coarse dry hair and they came out to be PERFECT super straight hair.. i have tried paul mitchel, chi even herstyler, BUT this is by far the best..  its amazing im sold. i really recommend HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inchthis product to everybody..",5
I have not heard about this company until my CHI unit had started having problems so I was looking for a new one. This unit is a fraction of the cost and reviews were great. I bout it and have been very happy with it. This straightener was perfect for my hair and added life to it.,5
"This is an awesome flat iron, seriously. I was in the market for a new one when i read reviews on the top 3 , and was able to make my decision quickly based on the price and quality. This iron is salon quality, I am very pleased with the round ends on each side when curling or just flipping out the hair at the ends. I am truly a satisfied customer and the shipping time was pretty quick.",5
This straightner does the job! It's not as expensive as the chi & it can actually straighten my curly thick hair. Great product for a great price!,4
"This flat iron works well on my super thick, frizzy hair. It leaves it it smooth and silky however it does need to be set on a higher setting than what is recommended for damaged hair since I have a lot of hair. It certainly works better than the iron that I had previously and is worth the money.",4
"My last flat iron which I paid about $90 for just got replaced with this one. I was going to get a sedu cuz I've read a lot of good things about it but when I was looking for it on amazon I came across this one and saw the great reviews and figured wth, it's only $35 Ill be throwing away if it doesn't work instead of $100 or more. When I got it I was very impressed. It was so smooth on my hair and seemed to straighten it very well. I didn't have to keep going back over it like my last flat iron. I loved the oil they sent with it but I'm already out! I'm definitely getting more! The oil seemed to make my hair straighter and smoother. I just hope this flat iron doesn't crap out shortly but so far so good!",5
"This is actually the second HSI straightener I have bought in the past year.  Yes, second...only because the first one got stolen by one of my very jealous friends!  I pride myself in being beyond knowledgeable about hair products and tools, in that I worked in a salon for many years and all of my closest friends are stylists.  I used the CHI for years and then switched to the very expensive Paul Mitchell flat iron.  I originally bought the HSI as a back up to my Paul Mitchell, but loved it so much that it has become starting team!  It heats up quickly, does not snag hair, and does more in one pass than most straighteners do in 3.  I love it and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new ceramic iron.",5
"I purchased around 6 different brands of hair straighteners,and this is by far the best I ever owned, there is  nothing that I didn't like about this product, I like it so much that I will purchase another one within this week, just to have one in home and one when i travel.",5
This iron is well made and sturdy. I can straighten or curl my hair with the iron. My daughter also likes the iron. Can't beat the price for the quality. Recommended!,5
"I ordered this straightener b/c my T3 had stopped working after four years! I originally purchased this to just get me through till I could decide which expensive straightener I was going to get next...however, I'm sticking with this one! It straightens and curls my hair beautifully and doesn't fry it!! So happy I ordered this!! Plus, the company was great to answer my questions!",5
"This is my first hair iron. At first I did not expect much as long as it can work. But when the product came, it is really in high quality. I especially like the feature that it can work on both 110V and 220V. Very convenient when travel. I will keep using it for a long time. Worth the money.",5
"First of all the shipping was fast, so that was great.  The flat iron works great and looks likes a professional flat iron (great packaging, comes with a small bottle of oil or serum for the hair, a glove and very stylish cover).  It gets hot very quickly and now I set it at about half the temperature.  It's easy and simple to use, it glides over my hair easily and leaves it very shiny and smooth.  I'm using it every day because I love the way my hair looks afterwards.  Very satisfied with this product and have already recommended it to my friends.",5
Easy to hold. Not to thin not to bulky just right. Heats up quickly and distributes heat evenly. I would recommend it to a friend and will deffinetly buy it again should anything happen after time.,5
After reading the great reviews about this straightener I decided to give it a try. So far it has lived up to all the great reviews it received. I like the fact that you can adjust the temperature. It also works really well curling hair also. I would recommend it.,5
"By far the best flat iron I ever owned and I have had more expensive ones. HSI heats up quickly thus you are able to use it right away. My hair is naturally frizzy curly but this styling tool makes my hair so manageable, soft and shiny, I highly recommend HSI. I love it so much and I'm sure others will to.",5
I have been looking online for a straightener and finally found one at a good price. i received this item quickly and it was in great condition and was exactly what i wanted! i will shop from this buyer again.,5
"This flat iron gave me salon results at home! I am very happy with the heat and the design. The controls are on the inside, so I don't change them with my hand while using it.",5
I am very pleased with this product! My friends all have Chi's and i was going to get one as well but I am glad I made this purchase due to the fact that I feel it is just as good if not better than a Chi. The product heated up in app. 30 seconds my friend was that has a Chi was amazed at how fast it heated up compared to her Chi. Overall this was definitely a GREAT buy with an affordable price!,5
This flat iron is absolutely great! I have thick hair and I'm trying to stretch the time between my retouches and this flat iron makes my hair feel so silky and straight. It gets hot fast and leaves my hair so silky in one pass. Would definitely recommend!,5
I bought the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. And I love the price! I can't believe what a deal I got on such a great product. My daughter loves the HSI Argan Oil that came with the iron. Plus I received a bag for the iron and a glove to wear while using the iron. Thanks for an unbelieveable product and price!,5
"This hair straightener is my favorite! The price is extremely good and the product is very high quality. I have thick, long, wavy hair and it straightens my hair perfectly! It works just as good, if not better, than my previous $80 straightener!",5
"So surprised by the HSI, it was so affordable and works fabulously. I have always used CHI which I loved, but this is even better! I loved the extras included, pretty bag,  glove and the argon oil (my new favorite). Both me and my silky hair are very happy!",5
"I love this hair straightener! It heats up fast and does wonders for my hair! It becomes so smooth and silky. If I straighen it the night before, it stays that way the following day. Love it :)",5
"After contemplating the purchase of the HSI flat iron, I finally placed the ordered. I am very pleased with the results after styling my hair. It really does straighten while also smoothing and eliminating frizz. What is amazing is that it stays even in humid conditions! I can already tell a huge difference between the HSI and my old curling iron which was ""frying"" my hair. The argon oil is a great product as well.",5
I found this HSI Flat Iron to be exactly what I was looking for.  It was important that it had an adjustable temp control and also have ceramic plates.  The price point fit in my budget and the iron came nicely packaged and ALSO with a padded satin-like storage bag.  I have fine hair and I use medium to medium high setting.  I mainly use the iron for smoothing my hair (I use a conditioning serum) and removing humidity frizz....works great!Shipping was quick and packed well.,5
This flat iron heats very quickly and flat irons your hair very well. I like this product and I would reconmend it to someone who ask about it I glad that I bought it.,4
"I am in love with this straightener. It heats up fast, and styles really well. Leaves my hair feeling soft.",5
This straightener is amazing!! It leaves my hair super straight and shiny! I mostly wanted it because it can also curl hair. It does an amazing job curling! I am so happy with this straightener!,5
"I have owned several straighteners,but this is by far the best one yet. I have had 2 professional flat irons that cost over $100 each and they did not heat up or straighten as good as this one.. I hope to get lots of use from this!",5
"i have probably used this iron approx. 10 times since i bought it. it heats up quickly and works well to straighten my hair. i should note that i have naturally straight hair to begin with, but the bottom half of my hair is damaged, so it's very frizzy. that being said, the product straightens my hair nicely, without any frizz. it also looks much glossier when using the included argon oil it comes with. the only complaint i have so far is that the indicator light (which shows red while heating up and green once it's ready) seems to go back to red once i start using the iron on my hair. i'm in the process of calling the company to see if that is normal or a defect. the other thing is that since it's small in size and i have long hair, it takes me a while to get through all of my hair. on the whole though, i would recommend it, especially for the price i purchased it at.",4
"I'm so glad I bought this and recieved it THREE days earlier than estimated! Seriously, the best straightner for $40! Heats up fast, has smooth plates, doesn't pull my hair, and is made very sturdy. Love the product, love amazon!",5
"I have owned a handful of great hair straighteners over the years and always I for quality because I have super thick hair and it isn't easy to get it straight. I used this product for the first time yesterday and I was very pleased with the result. I only had to run it through my hair once to get the silky smooth straightness I wanted (this is a big deal, trust me!). I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high end hair straightener for a great price!",5
I love this straightener.  I have tried several straighteners and this one does a great job.  I have naturally curly thick hair so I had to set it on the highest level.  It still looked straight and great at the end of the day.  So glad I bought this item.,5
I am very pleased with my HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  The price was excellent and the product is great.  I bought this to replace my Chi.  The only issue I have with this product is that the temperature control is on the inside of the clamps by the base which makes adjusting temp down a little awkward.,5
"I had been looking for a new straightener for a while, but didn't want to pay the high price tag that comes with most professional style straighteners. When I saw this one for less than $40, I couldn't pass it up. It had more than met my expectations. It takes me half the time to do my hair and my hair is so smooth and stays that way all day. Another added perk is the 110-220 voltage which is great for European travel. I would highly recommend this product. You won't regret it!",5
"Soft, shiny and sensational is how I would describe my hair after using the HSI flat iron. Everyone kept telling how shiny my hair looked and how straight my hair was. My hair was also soft and silky smooth thanks to the small argan sample. I have curly hair and sometimes with other straighteners it would kinda leave my hair wavy, but with HSI flat iron my hair was STRAIGHT. I love the HSI flat iron and for such a low price its definitely worth the buy. If your thinking about buying the HSI flat iron I say DO IT! You won't regret it, I sure don't!",5
This iron is great! The temperature controls are super easy to use and it makes my hair look great without burning it.,5
"I have a number of hair straighteners on my ultra-thick, coarse naturally wavy hair. By the end of the day, my bangs always look like they are trying to bring back the 80's. Not anymore. My HSI flat iron actually does the trick! It is easy to grip, heats up fast and gives me the straight hair I've never had. I highly recommend this product!",5
This iron glides so smoothly over my hair I can barely tell that I am clamping it between the plates.  I am very pleased with this iron especially for $40!,5
I love this straightner.  It works better than my chi!  It leaves my hair shiny and straight with just one or two runs down it.,5
"Bought one of these for myself, when my coworkers saw what a great job this flatiron did for my hair (super soft and smooth) they had me order for them too. I have ordered 4 so far.",5
"Recently my old flat iron broke (it was a cheap one from walmart) and I decided to splurge on a quality iron. I purchased this one at such a reduced price that I was worried that it would not be as nice as I wanted. After receiving it, I can happily say that I was wrong. It heats up very fast and makes my hair as smooth as silk. I don't think I will ever go back to a cheap one. This iron has spoiled me for all others. My only complaint is that it does not shut down on its own.",5
"The style, ease of use and the results. Are really nice! The packaging also gave you a sense high quality and great design and thought put into this product. I'm very pleased with my purchase",5
"This left my hair SO soft! Heated up super quick, and is so easy to use. Much better than the flat iron by a popular name that I paid nearly $100 for. I'll never go back to that one again after using this!",5
Bought this on Amazon and I love it. I have always beeb a CHI user but this product is over half the price and works very well!,5
"I bought this hair straightener for my daughter-in-law so I haven't used it, but she chose it to put on her Wish List.  I'm sure she did so thinking it would be a good one.",5
"This is an excellent  flat iron, I love it! Good flat iron for permed African American hair. Great value for the price.",5
"Looking for a flat iron I was a little bit skeptical because my CHI had recently started having problems. For how expensive the CHI is I expected it to last me longer than it did but unfortunately it didn't. So I found this one and read the reviews and it seemed to be about 80% of the reviews about this product were positive and the other 20% were negative. But I decided to give it a try anyways because it had everything I wanted. So I get my package in a VERY timely manner (fastest I've ever gotten an Amazon package) and very friendly customer service and tried it out that day. My hair looked amazing!! I perm my hair and haven't gotten a perm in about a month but friends will ask me if I just recently got a perm when I straighten my hair with this flat iron. It's an amazing product and an amazing price. This is for sure the flat iron for me and if anything were to happen with the one I currently have, I would buy another just like it.",5
"Truly outstanding straightener! My hair looks like I had it done in a salon. Love the oil that came with it...makes my hair soft and easy to style. Also, it came two days early! Love that! Thank you for the affordable and amazing straightener.",5
great flat iron! i have been using the chi for at least 10 years and it finally broke-i decided to try this product because it was a lot less expensive and had great reviews! will never pay $140 for a chi again. Would definately consider an hsi if youre looking for a great flat iron!,5
"I cant say enough good things about this flat iron! My sister is a hair dresser and she actually says that this flat iron is much better than the very pricey one she bought for the salon! Love the temperature control on it. One pass and it straightens wonderfully. Dont be fooled by the price, you can feel the quality of this flat iron, if you are shopping around for a new one, just stop and order this one, you will be so glad that you did!",5
I replaced my Chi with the HSI and my hair looks like I just left the salon after each use!  It is easy on my ends too:),5
"Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product and especially for the price. I've always used the Chi but thought I'd give another straightener a try. The HSI straightens like a Chi, maybe even better. I would highly recommend this straightener!",5
"I love love love it! The packaging is great. I love that they included the travel pouch and glove. The argan oil is a nice idea as well. The shipping was marvelous. Super fast and efficient. Over all I'm a very happy customer :D and before I forget, I have to say that it heats up fast as well.",5
"Very sturdy construction and great overall quality. Its not some cheap plastic that my old straighteners were made of that cracked and broke after some use. You wont even have to crunch press your hair in between the straightener for it to do its job like some other straighteners. For only $40, this is meant to last and will outdo the majority of the other straighteners out there. Spend 20$ for a OK item that might break in a few months and do a minimal good job, or get THIS for 40$ and it will last you for many years to come.",5
"I recently purchased this flat iron for my daughter.  She has very thick hair and it did a wonderful job.  Very sleek!  I've already purchased another one just for me!  Would definitely recommend this flat iron.  Also purchased at a great price, no shipping from Amazon",5
"The HSI 1"" flat iron is just what I was looking for!  It works wonders on my hair, and with the adjustable temperature control, I do not feel like I am completely scorching it.  Not to mention, the price is right.  It is a wonderful product and it comes highly recommended.",5
"This is a great product. I like the temperature control. I previously had a Chi straightener, which I used for several years. While the feel is different and the Chi was a great device, the HSI is a terrific find for the price.",4
This styler is the best I have tried. I own at least 3 and will only use this one now. It simply does exactly what you want of a styler. My hair is silky and smooth after using it. Perfect and easy to use.,5
This is the best flat iron I have ever brought!! I even do my daughters hair and mine with no problems at all!! I would recommend this product to everybody!! Love it!!!,5
It came in quickly and works wonders with my hair. I also love the argan oil that came with it. It smells so good!,5
"I had never heard of HSI before ordering, but I will definitely buy any other hair tools that they make. The iron heats up quickly and has floating plates. It works like a dream. This is the best flat iron ever! I highly recommend it. i found it online and I can't believe the price definitely worth it.",5
This is a great product. The straightener gets really hot but the outside isn't hot to the touch. The item was shipped to me quickly. I am really happy with my purchase and I got a great deal on the item.,5
"I've used instyler (Broke before a year of use), I've bought different types from walmart, target, etc.I haven't found a good straightener for my thick, curly hair until i found this one. I really like it because it's easy to you and works like a machine. The smaller sections you go over the better the results.",5
"I have extremely frizzy and very thick hair, so having a great straightener is a must. I used this product the second I got it, and I must say that I was quite impressed by the transformation from frizzy to straight, silky, soft hair. The quality of this product is very high, and it was a plus to receive a sample of their Argan Oil which even made my hair even more tame! If you're looking for a quality straightener get this one, it gives Chi or the ones in the mall a run for their money. Totally worth the amount I spent, and I would totally recommend it for others.",5
"I have been looking at this styler for a while(a lot of stylers). The price was right so I jumped.  I received it quickly from Blue Novelties and it was everything that had been promised with all the bells and whistles.  It is very exciting to get a professional commercial grade item at a discount store price. If there is another straightener in this price point at this quality, I don't know the brand.  Chi's price points are getting so random, for me, not a professional stylist, it is hard to know what grade I am getting. I am also happy I am not patronizing a superstore! So I am very Happy I went with HSI, Blue Novelties and Amazon.",5
"This product works great on my hair type (thick, wavy-ish hair that is somewhat coarse in the back), and straightens it quickly and smoothly. It's a great price too-I don't think you can find another hair straightener on the market right now for less than forty dollars of comparable quality to the HSI ceramic flat iron.Also, thanks to Amazon for the extremely fast delivery-I placed my order on Friday and it came Monday morning. I don't even have Prime!Overall, very impressed with my purchase.",5
the best deal in the world... makes ur hair look like a million bucks! looked everywhere for this long course hair of mine.,5
"The straightener warms up fast, and glides smoothly over my hair. My chi stopped heating up properly after 2 years of use and as a college student I could not afford to buy another one. This HSI straightener is an awesome alternative.",5
I have very wavy almost curly thick hair and lots of it!!!This flat iron can tame my hair in minutes.  I've used flat irons for years and this is the best one yet.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it doesn't have an auto shut-off feature.  My last few flat irons would shut-off after they sat idol for too long.Otherwise I love the HSI Flat Iron and I would buy again.,4
"This is my first flatiron, and my hair stylist said to make sure I got one with ceramic plates, which this one has. I was glad to find it because it was a way more palatable price for something I'm not sure how well I'll use. So far it's worked very well - even in my inexperienced hands. And my hair shows no wear and tear for using it. Came with a nice travel bag and a glove to protect your working hand! Although, the only piece of the iron that was hot were the plates, so I didn't feel like I needed the glove. Easy to use, though I did have to hit the reset button on the plug first - that was a little odd. I also like the sample of Argan oil.",5
"I've only used this item one time so far, but it works great!  I have been blessed with hair that is long, thick, coarse, wavy (the Hawaiian in me) & frizzy.  I tried the ""natural"" look for a long time, but decided it's ok to go straight, especially if it makes me feel better about myself. The price also was what sold me on it. It came packaged nicely, with the added gift of Argan Oil & a pretty carry bag.",4
"I have very thick, curly hair and with this iron it only takes me about 20 minutes to straighten it! I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it! Great price!",5
The straightener didn't get my hair all the way straight. My hair was a little wavy.  This product was just ok.,4
"My daughter has very very thick wavy hair.  It is usually not worth the time it takes to straighten her hair.  With this straightener we are able to straighten it fairly quickly in comparison.  It works great, heats up quickly and is easy to manage.",5
I love this straightner. I was heart broken when my chi died but didn't want to spend another $100 on a straightner so I gave this one a try and it works just as well or better. I love that you can adjust the temperature of the iron to you liking.,5
i have really thick hair and this straight iron is the best thing i have ever had i really would recommend this to anyone who has long thick hair,5
I received the item fast! It works great! I have a CHI and it works ok but I noticed my hair was not staying straight. I decided to get another straightener and found this one!!! Awesome !! Especially for the price!,5
This is a great product! Makes my hair straight and shiny and I also love that it is easy to curl with as well. It can get very hot so it is great for all different hair types. The shipping was super fast. I am very impressed. I have recommended this product to all my friends who need new hair straighteners.,5
Love the flat iron and would recommend. It was a great value. Works great on thick frizzy hair. Would purchase again.,5
"I was very skeptical even after reading all the positive  reviews, but this flat iron didn't disappoint.  My hair is silky straight. I love it.",4
I am very pleased with this flat iron.  It performs better than my expectations and the results are just as described.,5
"Great product. Heats and cools quickly, works fantastic. Salon quality, I believe my hairstylist even has the same one?  I would recommend to anyone with any type hair.",5
"Received in a timely manner.  I have used it only a couple of times so far, but have been very happy with it.  It heats up quickly and provides great results.",5
Shipped fast and works very well so far. I've only had it for a couple of weeks and only used it a couple times so hopefully it holds up.,4
"Absolutely love my new flat iron. Came in a gorgeous red box with a sample argan oil and thermal glove. What a treat for my self. Can't believe I only paid 40 bucks. Just go a head and buy buy buy!! Bought from bluenovelties,great seller!",5
Recently switched from my Cricket flat iron to the HSI flat iron and it is 1000 times better! It straightens my hair so much better and faster without breaking it. My hair is shiny and the style lasts a lot longer than with my previous flat iron. Awesome iron for less than I paid for the Cricket. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had an auto shut off like my Cricket in case you forget to unplug it.,5
"Amazing product for great price!!!I use it every day, it does not damage my hair and works fast!!!Highly recommended!!! My man can't stop touching my hair when they are so silky and soft!!!Don't waste your money on $200 irons when u can be as happy with this one!!!!",5
Received my flat iron really quick. Works great! Pulls smooth through my hair and doesn't seem to damage my hair.,5
"I had a Chi iron that I loved, but passed it on to my daughter when I got a new one with an adjustable temperature.  Never liked the second one.  I saw that the HSI had great reviews and the price was appealing, so I ordered one. It works very well - much better than my last Chi iron did.  It does, however, pull a little (but then so did the Chi).  I would definitely recommend it! I have thick coarse hair, and it straightens/curls much better than my Chi did.",5
The product is great. Heats up fast and its great for styling in different ways. You can go straight or curl it up. I love it. I am 100% satisfied.,5
Wow!!! Not only did I receive my package almost a week early ( and there was a holiday during the delivery time too) but this straightener is great!! I have REALLY THICK wavy hair and a lot of it lol so its hard to get my hair straight but this straightener does the trick! It heats up quickly and you can adjust it to any temp you want. This is definitely a great product for a wonderful price. Must Buy!!!,5
I really have enjoyed the flat iron. it is very easy to use and i have had terriffic results. Many of my co workers have commented on how straight all my hair is with this product.,5
"I bought the HSI to replace my Revlon that had gotten old and caked with hair product (whoops!)I have always been a ""middle of the road priced straightener at Walmart or Target"" kind of girl, but as an avid Amazon shopper, I decided to see what I could find here! I read and re-read all the reviews and got really excited about this straightener. I have fine, just past the shoulder length hair with choppy layers that I flip out. It tends to be pretty manageable and stay how I style it (when it's NOT humid), but since it's naturally an uncontrolled wavy, I straighten it almost daily. Because of the daily use I decided to bite the bullet and fork over $50 and it was well worth it!It heats up nice and fast and has the ability to change the temperature. I have never had a straightener slide so smoothly over my hair and it leaves my hair frizz-free, smooth, and shiny. I absolutely love how long the cord is and it never tangles. The only reason I took off a star is because to get my hair to flip out just how I like it, I have to pass the straightener over several times (this could also be attributed to the humidity, so check back when winter is in full swing). I could also increase the heat, but am afraid to do so just because my hair is so fine.Overall this is a product that is VERY WORTHY of spending a little more $$ on than what you usually do- especially if you're a daily hair straightener like me!",4
"I love love LOVE this iron. I've had a CHI (hated) and my previous iron was my beloved Sedu. After having it for 7 yrs it died. I was going to buy another one, but I came across this one and read the great reviews. I thought for $40 I didn't have much to lose. I must say it is AWESOME! It really straightens without much effort. Just one sweep through the section of hair was all it needed. The only thing that some people may not like is that it's slightly heavier than previous irons I've had. Not a big deal to me. It's a great product with a great price.",5
"I had never used a flat iron before so I had to practice a bit to get the hang of it.  This is the only one I've ever used, but I like it.  I particularly like the idea of being able to control the level of heat.  I ordered another one and returned it because it didn't have a heat control knob.  This flat iron does what it's supposed to do and I get better at it every day.  Lots of humidity in the air lately so having the HSI Ionic Flat Iron really helps!",5
"I LOVE this flat iron! I had been using a comparable CHI which I was perfectly happy with. The reason I even bought this HSI flat iron is because it was so inexpensive (on sale for $39.99) and it received such high reviews I figured it was worth a try. I am so glad I got it because the Reviews are completely true...this HSI flat iron works even better on my hair than my CHI. I have very frizzy, thick hair that is chemically relaxed. After washing my hair, I usually allow it to air dry over night, brush it out in the morning, apply 2 drops of Argan Oil and a heat protector spray then use my flat iron, working on small sections at a time. With my CHI, I would pass over each section 2 or 3 times and was happy with the result. With this new HSI flat iron, I pass over each section ONCE for the same result! Cuts my styling time significantly. I had already been using Argan Oil in my hair so I wasn't surprised with how great it works to tame frizzy hair. I don't find the HSI brand oil any better/worse than another brand I already own but it's nice to get a free sample. I definitely recommend this product.",5
"I purchased this after going through 2 CHIs in a few months. I've had the HSI flat iron for a few weeks and it does a really nice job on my hair. I am really pleased with it, especially for the price. I'll definitely never buy a CHI again when I can get this item that (so far) works just as well for a fraction of the cost.",5
"Flat iron heats up super fast and works great. Maintains the heat well. Comes with a handy light that lets you know when it's at the heat selected, green, or the heat has gone down a little, red, and you need to give it a moment or two to heat back up to the temperature selected.Works fine. Would recommend.",5
"I bought this straightener largely due to all of the positive reviews here on Amazon, and so far I am more than happy with this product. A lot of the reviews said it would keep your hair straight all day, and I didn't believe them. But it did! My hair stayed straight, even through the fog and humidity of San Francisco in the summer. The iron heats up quickly and is very easy to use. Comes with a weird satin pouch, glove and a small thing of argan oil for you hair.I still can't figure out why this is such a good deal ($40) when it's $129 on the manufacturer's website. Definitely as good or better than some of the more expensive models out there. I definitely recommend this straightener - I only wish I bought it sooner!!",5
I received my flat iron today and I was so excited. I plugged it in and it heated up really fast. I was surprised that it straightened my hair. The only negative thing I can find with this flat iron is how heavy it is. I had the Solia 1 inch for about 4yrs and it stopped working so I bought this for the price.  I just don't know if I can deal with how heavy and awkward it feels when I curl my own hair. I would probably buy another Solia when funds become available but until then I will have to cope with this. Don't get me wrong for the price this flat iron is great but I'm use to curling my hair with a light weight iron.,4
The red bag it is shipped in so so pretty.  Comes with a tiny bottle of stuff for your hair.  Even has glove!,5
"I recently got a new haircut and the stylist used a flat iron to style my hair.  I loved the way my hair looked.  The stylist suggested that I get a flat iron with ceramic plates.  After much searching around and reading the reviews I purchased the HSI Ceramic Ionic Flat Iron.  The first time I used it I knew I made a great decision.  It works wonderfully.  I have a slight natural wave in the back of my head that is practically impossible to straighten with a hair dryer and a round brush so it always looks like I missed a spot.  However, using the flat iron I was able to get rid of the wave no problem.  I have very thick hair and it takes a long time to blow dry it.  The flat iron cut the drying time in half and I didn't even need to use the round brush.  I was concerned about frying my hair, but this iron comes with a temperature setting that allows you to control how hot you want it to be.  I used the middle setting and it was perfect.  My hair looks great and feels wonderful.  It's very soft and shiny and not at all dried out.  I would highly recommend this flat iron for anyone who does not have a lot of time in the morning to get ready, but still wants to look their best.",5
"I knew I needed a good flat iron, but wasn't willing to pay the price of a Chi.  I've had this flat iron for 6 months and so far, has been wonderful.  Heats up fast and stays hot with every pass through my hair.  It glides nicely, never snags my hair & the cord is really long, which is great!",5
"Straightner is ok, for the price.  But, I prefer my old on to this one. I have thick/wavy hair and it takes more time to straighten with this product.  Price is good though.",3
I ordered the Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron after I broke my old iron.  Breaking the old one was a blessing in disguise.  I love this iron.  My hair looks great after using it for the first time.,5
"I bought this flat iron after much research and comparison. I ended up choosing between the CHI, HSI and Baby Bliss. I chose HSI because of the awesome reviews and the great price. I received everything as described.First the Argon oil: I love the smell and it takes really well to my hair.The pouch and the glove: love themThe actual flat iron is heavenly. I have very curly hair. And I recently had it cut in a very short asymmetrical bob. I love the cut, it's just so hard for me to make it look sleek and smooth like when I go see my hair dresser. I always found that blow drying only made my hair too bouncy and voluminous for this cut. I was using a Maxius Maxi Glide that I bought over 5 years ago, but that would just leave my hair bone straight and lookin sooo dry, no matter what oily product I put on. With the HSI my hair is so easy to style. The fact that it's ceramic plate and not metal makes a world of difference. Oh! Also, I work out daily, so my hair curls right up during after my workouts. All I do is air dry the hair and run the HSI though the affected areas and my hair is shiny, silky and ready to face the day.I really, really, really like that this flat iron doesn't dry my hair out and that I can make my hair look like I just left the salon. Even my husband complimented me on making such a good purchase.The only things I would caution you about is the heat settings. It can get really hot. Also, don't put big/wide chunks of hair at a time because it can get caught on the edges.",5
"Happy i went with this brand! I just love it!!! It does it's work, my hair looks Amazing.... So far I think this is the best flat iron I ever had, my 2 previous ones sucked! My sister just bought Chi flat iron, she hates it, and loves mine, So I'm very happy with it. And You won't be disappointed, I promise you!:) Good price too, & fast shipping!",5
Cheap and it works great! Shipped fast and I love the oil that came with it. Highly recommend it for difficult hair.,4
"I have been debating whether or not I should buy this flat iron for a few months, and I finally did. It came in two days and I am very impressed! It heats up very quickly, and works extremely well! It did not come with the argan oil sample everyone talks about, but I used John Frieda Full Repair and my hair looked amazing. :)",5
I recieved them in like 3 days. I actually love the flat irons. They work great. They also get hot in seconds... im very impressed!,5
Does not compare to the Chi. It pulls my hair out and no matter what I do it causes my hair to be frizzy. Cannot use to curl from it pulling the hair.,3
The Styler flat iron worked well.  I like that you can adjust the temps and it heated up fast. A light or something to notify you when it reached the temp would be helpful but is not necessary.  It curled the ends of the hair under well.  I am not sure why it came with a glove but I love the packaging and storage pouch.,5
"Good luck finding an iron that does as good of a job as this one and for the same price or less. This iron is in the same league as Paul Mitchell, FHI, and CHI but can't be beat for the price. I would recommend this to anyone.On a side note: Don't put the heat up too high if you have thin/medium hair.",4
"This flat iron is a great product. Works as expected, heats up fast, and gets hot enough to smooth my curly hair!",4
Great product! It was exactly as described in the product description. It heats up quickly and works well with my hard-to-style hair. It is definitely a high-quality product. Thank you!,5
"I have had this straightener for just about a month now, and I really like it. It gives me long-lasting results and leaves my hair silky smooth. I am, quite literally, addicted to using it!",5
"Total professional experience! Design prevents you from burning your scalp when straightening from roots to ends- wich is great!!! I've had professional flat irons before, but this one is definitely THE BEST!!! Strong, solid product with delicate touch that leaves your hair silky smooth.Argan oil smells great and protect ends from splitting.(I got a little sample, but I'm definitely giong to order a full size bottle)I recommend HSI Flat Iron to every girl and woman out there!MUST HAVE ITEM !!!

BIG SAVINGS! (That's one of the reasons I got it in a first place :) )-----> Get it and look fabulous :D <-----",5
"I love this flat iron, as other reviews have said, it works as well as the irons that cost hundreds of dollars.  There was a small snafu with my order and the company could not have been more responsive and solved my issue immediately.  I highly recommend this product!",5
"I absolutely love this straightener. It is designed perfectly for all hair types. It gets very hot, for thick hard to style hair. Great product and will recommend to all my friends!",5
"These are the best flat irons that I have had in my life. Compared to the chi flat iron I think they are the same, although the HSI is slightly better, and the price was unbeatable. I opened and flat ironed my hair the day I recieved the package, and its been humid and hot and my hair is still in the same straight, light, siilky soft state. These flat irons work on natural and weaves. I love it.  I encourage everyone to buy product, before the price goes up. Trust me it is worth everyone penny. I love my flat irons.",5
"Just received my HSI Hair straightener today and the first thing that I did my tried it on my hair. It's absolutely amazing. It definitely leaves your hair looking very nice and silky, unlike other previous hair straighteners that I've owned. So far so good. If ever this hair straightener breaks or something, I'd definitely buy another HSI straightener.",5
"Love it. This flat iron works better than I ever expected! I have owned a chi, and several other brands and this, by far, beats them all.",5
"It is very lightweight and works well.  The only minor that I have with the product is that it doesnt have a clasp to hold the straightener together.  I was used to my previous straightener where there was a prong to hold the straightener together while it's on; however, it's a minor issue and something that I have to get to used to.",4
"My wife wanted a new straigtener, and afer reading all this good reviews I chose to buy this one. As hoped, service is good, shipment is fast and in top of all, my wife loved it. She liked the fact that this one is fast in getting hot and has tempreture adjustment option.I would recommend this one for others...Thanks",5
"I have used this flat iron twice since my purchase (3 days ago) and it works well, I'm not styling my hair regularly so it works for me, slim design, easy to use, the cable is of a suitable length, it comes with a glove and a soft pouch for storage. Previous comments said that it comes with an argan oil sample but not my kit, I don't know if it was a limited edition gift or they just forgot include one on my purchase (one star less because of that). Anyway I like this hair flat iron so I recommend it.",4
"Wife is a hairstylist and needed a new flatiron. Her main requirement was a small form factor, because with her clientele, she needs to be able to get the iron close to the scalp without burning. This flat iron fit the bill and she's been happy using it so far. I have to say I'm not really adept at the usage of the flatiron, but the finish is a really high quality, hard rubberized texture. I myself am a fan of high quality electronics and I would say the design of this flatiron, compared to the ones she previously owned, is superb. Kind of motorola razr-ish.",5
"After years of just buying cheap flat irons I finally decided that I needed to take better care of my hair and use a ceramic flat iron.  After reading reviews I ordered the HSI flat iron.  I have not regretted this purchase.  My hair is extremely thick and stubborn with partially natural waves.  This flat iron leaves my hair shiny, without the split end looking style and my hair doesn't revert back to its waviness as soon as I step out of the door.",5
Excellent product. Really works great. Best ever. Quick delivery also. Have tried many others and this one works quickly and heats up fast.,5
The straightner is exactly as described.  I have owned many straightners over the years and this one is clearly the best.  Cuts down on the length of time that I spend doing my hair.  I don't have any flyaways or burned hair.  I'm really glad I purchased this of the Chi because of its better price and quality and I have heard nothing but horror stories over the Chi ever since I purchased this.  Its just a great product.,5
I really like this flatiron.  My hair is pretty thick and coarse and it manages to straighten in while leaving it shiny and soft.  The argan oil that comes with it is very nice also.,5
This hair straightener is so awesome!  Heats up super quick and it leaves hair feeling soft and silky!  It is great when I don't feel like keeping my naturally curly hair and straightening it out is so quick and easy!  Thank you!,5
"Love this flat iron. I have extremely curly hair and usually need several products in my hair in order to straighten up. However, with my new HSI flat iron all I need is a little bit of Moroccan oil!",4
Works great! I am very happy with this straighter. Got it for a really good price too. I love how it came with a protective sleeve to put over it when you are traveling.,5
"I love this flat iron!! I was planning on running down to the store and grabbing a Chi but a friend told me about this (she has it) and the great deal.  I got it and love it!  Its great quality, has the swivel cord so its not in the way.  A lot of people said it came with a small bottle of hair stuff...I didn't get anything like that with mine, just a nifty heat glove I will never use...lol...I did get some spray from a local salon called Perfect 10, and that combined with this flat iron gives me the best hair I've had in years.  I live in FL and the hurricane that just came through with that insane humidty...My hair was GORGEOUS in spite of it!!  I have coarse, weird hair and I have had people ask me over and over since I started using it...did you get your hair done at a salon today? Nope :)",5
"I saw this flat iron advertised on another website.  It was on sale through Amazon, so I thought I'd take a look.  I read the reviews & decided to take a chance on this flat iron.  I'm so glad I did.  The HSI just replaced my 3 year old flat iron & is similar to what I was use to using.  I like the way it slides down my hair without pulling.  I also like the temperature setting.  The travel bag is a bonus.",5
"HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch--Great product...much better than a CHI if you ask me.  LOVE IT!!!",5
"I took forever to choose a flat iron as there are so many to choose from and I tend to research WAY too much. I recently got my hair cut shorter in kind of a curved under bob (I had brain surgery back in May and there were several shaved areas). My stylist did a great job so the spots can't even be seen. The shaved spots have grown back quite a bit, however I'm going to keep it shorter as I really like the style.I quickly realized that I would need a new flat iron to keep my coarse hair smooth and to curl the ends under. I'm so glad that I chose the HSI. What a great gift this would make for the holidays!. The packaging is beautiful. A nice red box, a satiny red sleeve to keep it end - handy for traveling. It even comes with a sample bottle of their Argan oil and a heat glove if you are concerned about handling it when hot. The oil is super - I may very well order a larger size bottle.The curl lasts for quite awhile so if you need to skip a day or more of washing your hair, the style lasts! I'm so pleased with this and with the small touches such as the oil, I think I'll buy one or two for gifts for the holidays. I highly recommend this flat iron for so many reasons. Buy it, you won't regret it!",5
"I love having the ability to control the temperature. I had a chi before and loved it, but it was brutal on my hair. I am able to use this one on my 4 year old who has very fine and thin hair. It also comes with a glove, case, and argan oil. LOVE IT!",4
I have tried multiple flat irons and this is the first one that I can hands down look forward to using. I use it daily and I find that I can get every style I want. I no longer use my curler as this does a better job as well. Very impressed and would recommend!,5
"I Like the temperature control, as I can turn it up for me and turn it down for my six year old.",5
I found this item at a great price so I was willing to take a chance based on other great reviews.  I am happy to say that I love my new flat iron and it definitely lives up to the hype.,5
"I was amazed at how amazing this straightener this is! It leaves my hair very smooth and silky and stays straight until I wash it again. Even my boyfriend has made so many compliments on how nice my hair looks like. And for the price, this product is a no-brainer!",5
Thank you for a great product.  The hair straightener takes care of my frizzy hair.  Terrific low price. Easy and quick to use.,5
"Awesome hair straightner! Love it!! Does every thing it is supposed to do and more, best thing out there! Highly recommend to anyone else looking for the same thing",5
"This straightener is everything I hoped it would be.  I've used other nice straighteners in the past (CHI and others), and this one is VERY comparable but at a much cheaper price.  I am very satisfied with this product.",5
I received this product promptly and have used it almost every day and I love it! It does a great job and I couldn't have asked for a better product!,5
Must say for the price put its a qood straightner ive only used it once so cant rate to much bht so far so good,3
I have long wavy/curly hair. This straightener got my hair straighter than the other 2 straighteners I have used. I even had people comment that they had never seen my hair so straight before.I love how quick it heats up too.,5
I really like this flat iron! I have had 2 CHI irons in the past and can honestly say this iron works better. My daughter and cousin have used it and love it! I would definitely recommend HSI to friends & family.,5
"The HSI flat iron is great for frizzy, hard to manage hair.  It is as good, or better, than the CHI flat iron.It heats quickly and my hair is flatter than it has ever been before.  It also has a great sheen that it neverhas had before.  I highly recommend the HSI ceramic flat iron for anyone who has curly, coarse and thick hair.",4
My daughter and I absolutely love this new flat iron.  It doesn't pull our hair it straightens in no time and my daughter loves giving her hair a curl with the slender iron.,5
I really like this flat iron...it is easy to use and has many heat settings for different varieties of hair.  I like how easy it is to straighten my hair or to flip it up on the ends.  Thank you.,5
"I purchased two HSI flat irons because of the good reviews I had read and the great pricing that was offered. (I will be giving one as a Christmas gift).  I really didn't need a new one, I was completely happy with the one I was using until I used the HSI flat iron.  It heats up extremely quickly! My hair does not get caught in the plates and ripped out :) like would happen with my other flat iron. It leaves a smooth finish to my hair. I also like the fact that it came with a carrying bag. Great product for my very fine straight hair.",5
"Awesome seller! Awesome product! Great price and very fast shipping! I was very satisfied with everything and if I ever need a hair straightener in the future, I would like to purchase again!",5
"I was looking for a hair straightener and read all the reviews, and decided to buy this on.  The price was right, and I really like it.  I also bought one for my daughter.  It arrived before schedule, I was impressed.",5
"My daughter had a chi and paid over $120. I didnt want to spend that much but wanted really good quality. This straightener is both. Works very well, heats quickly and evenly and fits those who are budget conscious.",5
"This iron is the best, I've spent a lot of money on buying so far this iron is the best. I like the fact that it has a glove including a little bag. Trust me this iron is worth the money that it cost.",5
I've been using the product since I got it. And very satisfy .... just as I expected after reading the great reviews on Amazon.,4
This hair straightener is so amazing. I really recommend it for others to have such a high quality item in their homes,5
The HSI Ionic Flat Iron heats up quickly.  It has a dial to adjust the heat to your hair's thickness.  I have thin but damaged hair so I can set it pretty high.  It works quickly and one pass through works.  My hair turns out straight and soft.,5
I have been using the Chi and decided to try this iron. Really like it. It is nice that it has a heat control on the handle. Very light weight,5
I have been looking for a very good flat iron for a very long time and I came across the HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener.  It was marked down with free shipping.  I received the flat iron in about one week.  The packaged was packaged neat without any damage.  I am very impressed with the flat iron and would highly recommend to anyone looking.  It straightens the hair pretty fast and stays all day without frizz.,5
This straightener is the smallest and best I have used so far. It worked really well on my thick hair and my mom's crazily thick hair.,5
Very pleased with this flat iron.  It seems to be very well made.  Heats up quickly.  Comes with glove.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I would recommend this seller.,5
"Great product, much less money than my previous Chi. Easy to hold and does exactly what you expect. Shipped promptly.",5
For a price of 40$ i get a ceramic straightener that comes with a glove (which ive never heard of before or seen) AND argan oil. im so happy with this lightweight good quality straightener that comes with adjustable heat settings and it gets my hair straight with one take. fast shipping and good communication.,5
"All in all this purchase surprised me. I have used chi in the past and am impressed that it matches pretty closely in the same quality. The heat indicator is a dial, and doesn't indicate how hot the iron is which is annoying. I have fine curly hair that has a tendency to frizz. It does an excellent job styling. And holding the style. It get hot. I mean REALLY hot. I have yet to do my hair on the hottest setting. I threw out the oil it came with, it made my hair too greasy. The satin heat proof bag is cute and make putting away the iron easy and safe.",4
"Being someone with extremely thick and curly hair, not all flat irons work so well but this one was awesome!  It took a lot less time and did break your hair off like some others do.  It seriously, left my hair soft and shiny and no one would ever know I had extremely thick and extremely course, curly hair.  Love it!!!",5
"Just received this product 3 days ago, used it yesterday, and I'm a believer.. It straightened my hair silky straight!",5
"I recently cut all my hair off into a short pixie cut. I needed to invest in a new flat iron that was a little smaller but still wouldn't damage my hair. I have used this iron a few times now and I love it! It heats up incredibly quickly, straightens well, and does not damage my hair. I have also been using the oil that came with the product. It is a very small sample bottle but you don't need much. Because my hair is so short now, the sample will last me at least a month. I will most likely buy more once my sample runs out. So happy I bought this iron!",5
"The first time I used this, AMAZING, second, AMAZING, third, it seemed like it was about to die. I really like, no LOVE this product, but it seemed like it's dieing.. Can I get a new one?",4
"I bought this flat iron when my Chi finally gave up, as it looked like a respectable substitute and was quite a bit less expensive. It was a good choice. It's a great iron, and I've been using it daily for some time now. Heats fast and hot, feels solid and well made. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I can't see the on-light as well as the Chi from the low angle of my counter, and have left irons on a few times in the past (Chi included). Aside from that minor issue, I'm very pleased with the HSI iron and would certainly buy it again.",4
I've been using a flat iron for about 4 years off and on but didn't quite get what the big deal was. My hair never looked the same as when my hair dresser would flat iron it for me. Then I bought this one and it's amazing. This one works so much better I can't believe it. I don't even have to hold it long at all - so less damage.  Love it!,5
"I have always used a Chi so I was hesitant to try an unfamiliar brand but with the great price I thought I'd give it a try. I am very glad that I did! It works just as well as the Chi and it came with a glove and a small bottle of oil for your hair and a pouch to carry it in. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a good flat ironHSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE HEAT CASE & GLOVE. DUAL VOLTAGE 110/220V..",5
"When I heard all of the hype about this flat iron I thought people were being overly dramatic, but when it came time to retire my old flat iron this one happened to be on sale and I took a chance. So glad I did. It heats up quickly and gets super hot, I don't even need to use the highest setting like I usually do on most flat irons. In combination with the little mini bottle of Argan oil that comes in the package, my hair has never been so shiny, smooth, and soft after straightening; and it stays like that all day. I've been made a  believer and am so stoked that I decided to give this flat iron a try. Will also be purchasing the full size bottle of the Argan oil.",5
I like the adjustment ability it saves me from burning my hair.Never had a variable heat flat iron before and I think this is my new favorite.And the price was awsome.,5
The product is GREAT. The item arrived exactly on the day they said it would. And I absoloutely love it.,5
Works very well and quickly gets the job done. Comes with a very nice sleeve for it and some great heat-protected gloves as well. Worth the purchase at a great price.,5
"I bought a babyliss 2in straightener a few years ago and have loved it but now need smaller one.  Have gone through 3 that were $50 or less in the last year.  They have all been terrible pulling hair out, making it frizzy, and just not working with my course wavy hair.  I decided to buy this straightener after reading excellent reviews and it was on sale.  Let me tell you, this has changed my life!  Works amazing!  And came with some argan oil....my hair has never felt so soft!  Trust me, you have to have this product!",5
I am very pleased with the results after using this flat iron. The flat iron not only give the professional salon look* it is easy to use. I am super satisfied with this product.,5
I purchased this flat iron apprehensively because it was a company that I've never heard of but best beauty product I've ever purchased. Very durable flat iron and left my hair silky and pin straight. It took me about twenty minutes to straighten really curly and frizzy hair that is a little past the midway of my back. If you purchase this you won't regret it!,5
The title says it all!  I am very happy with this flat iron.  It works great and heats up quickly and leaves my hair looking nice!!,5
"I will start by saying I am a flat iron co-dependent!!! I went to visit my mom this summer and after she did so much for me and my girls, I could not say NO when she asked me if she could keep my CHI. I've had that CHI for 5 years, paid top $$$ for it and it was hard for me to say ""sure!"". Browsing online for a new flat iron I came across this one and liked all the positive reviews but the price was even more attractive. Why not? I would give it a try and not spend a lot. First try...I was in love with it! I have ethnic caribbean background and my hair is little hard to handle, reason why I have spent money in the past buying expensive flat irons. One thing for sure, always use it with your favorite oil or serum. They send you a free sample of a good argan oil. Don't ever think you will have to pay top money to own a professional flat iron, I just found out myself.",5
I bought this because my old straightener just took too long to work.  This is a great product.  I came very nicely packaged.  It would be a perfect gift for Christmas or birthday or??.  It heats up fast and works great.  My hair is shiny and nice and it lasts until the next shampoo.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find a heat protective glove included!  Wow!  That is just what I needed and it WAS on my wish list.  Give this baby a try and think about Christmas gifts - never too soon to start!,5
"I mostly ordered this styler due to the price drop and the reviews.  This is a solid flat iron that does a good job on my hair.  I have coarse, wavy hair that frizzes like crazy in the summer.  This iron took care of that and my hair stayed smooth and straight all day.  The controls are on the inside of the iron handle (just below the two plates) which are both a plus and a minus.  The plus is that you can't accidentally shut off the iron in the middle of styling your hair, as I have done with another straightener that I have.  The minus is that there is potential to burn yourself in order to reach the on/off switch and temperature control.  This iron can get REALLY HOT, people!  The only other minus is that there is no indicator light to show that it is on, so you could pick it up and possibly burn yourself. The product comes with a glove and a carrying pouch, as well as a small vial of styling oil.  I didn't really use the oil, I didn't feel I needed it.  The styler did the job well enough without me having to use any extra product on my hair.  As for the glove, it's not completely heat proof.  I did end up using it because after straightening a section of hair, it was very hot to the touch with just my bare hand, so the glove helped.  In spite of the minuses, (every styler of this kind has burn potential) I like this straightener a lot for the price (I paid $39.99 for it).",5
"I purchased this product for my wife and she is very pleased with it. For an affordable and very good product, you cannot go wrong with the HSI Flat Iron.",5
"I previously had a chi, it was amazing. My dog chewed it and I needed to get a new iron. The chi I had runs about $100. This iron is just as good, maybe better because it heats up quickly.  The oil it comes with ia amazing too. It smoothes my hair with one pass. Only thing I didn't like was the case. It has no place for the cord. But for that price it's still an amazing deal.",5
"Not only did the iron arrive days before the earliest I excpeted, but after one use, I could tell the difference between it and other irons I've tried.  This is by far the best one, and it wasnt even the most expensive.  The soft case is great for travel and storage, the construction seems very durable and mostly rubberized, doesnt slip around on the counter.  The handle is cool enough to touch during operation, and even the tip stays cool enough so that you can touch the end of it without the glove (which is also included).  I use the glove to set it on, rather than buying a stand for it.  Heat-up time is pretty much consistent with other irons ive tried.  There are no plastic molding bits for your hair strands to get caught in while ironing.  The heat control and on/off switch are located inside, and out of the way, so you dont accidentally touch them while in operation.  There is also a ready-light built into the handle.I've got very thick and coarse dark brown hair.  It is naturally very wavy to curly in parts.  The iron had no problem easily straightening my hair with only a few passes and with a spritz of hair spray after, it stayed perfectly smooth all day at work - in Florida! (During hurrican season, so there is pleanty of Humidity!)Came with a GFI Plug and a 2ml sample of Argan oil which is also great.  (Ive already ordered the 4 oz bottle)All in all, I couldnt be happier with it.",5
"I was looking for a flat iron that would actually straighten my thick hair.  I have been so disappointed with previous flat irons I've had but can't spend a lot of money on a fancy one (plus the one time I did spend over $100 on one, it only lasted a year).  After reading the other reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try, and I am very impressed.  It is perfect!  It has a nice long cord, a grippy texture so there's no danger of it slipping out of your hands, and it heats up super quickly even when using at the highest heat.  It comes with a heat-resistant glove, travel pouch, and argan oil sample, which makes the price even more unbelievable.  Most importantly, it works really well.  I struggled doing curls and beach-y twists with my previous irons (they would look all crinkly, and the iron would slip off the hair), but this flat iron is impressive.  A few seconds per strand is all it takes to create beautiful, messy twists, and it also straightens hair wonderfully when I want a smoother look.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It seems to give me the same results as my hairdresser's iron, and I know hers was several hundred dollars.  A great buy!!  I could not be happier.",5
"I did a lot of research about hair straighteners before deciding on this one, I am happy with my purchase.  The straightener heats up quickly to a high temperature.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that my hair does catch on the Irons from time to time.  That would be my only complaint.",4
"I bought this styler after reading multiple comments about hair irons being ruined after being plugged into European outlets, even when using a converter.  Rather than risking my expensive Chi, I bought this iron because it had the dual voltage capacity.  It worked great with only an outlet adapter.  Very close to my Chi.",5
"I was skeptical of buying a new straightener.I have had my CHI for 4 years with out a single problem.I read all of the reviews for this product, and for the price I decided I didn't want to miss this offer.I like it, a lot.If the price were to increase, I think I would still stick with a CHI, but this is good competition.I just like CHI better, because the plates inside ""glide"" smoother across my hair. Or at least it feels like it.The better thing about this straightener is that the heat is adjustable. On my CHI it isn't.",4
This was just like the $75 ones and for way cheaper.  Seems high quality so far! No problems at all and we've had it for a few months.,5
"I was looking for a good straightener that wouldn't break the bank. I originally was going to invest in a CHI straightener (my thought being that investing in a good straightener was worth it), until I found this one with high ratings on Amazon. I did some more research on Youtube, reading other reviews, and decided that it was the right fit for what I was looking for.I received in in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime, and tried it out that night and was very happy with the results. My hair is naturally straight and doesn't give me any issues, but this straightener made my hair look sleek and styled. It heated up quickly, and I love the swivel cord. The temperature adjuster is nice, but I do wish that there were more in-between temperatures (it only shows the lowest and highest temperatures), but I just set the dial to the middle of the spectrum. Really easy to use, and looks nice as well. Definitely did the job for a fraction of the cost of the other straightener I was going to invest in.Very happy with my purchase, my hair is looking very nice.",5
This hair straightener is excellent. It heats up quickly and straightens my hair in very little time. The product also came with a glove and a sample of hair serum to use with the straightener. My hair came out silky smooth.,5
"Bought this as a gift. It is a great product and the best straightener she has ever used. Only criticism would be about the weird placement of the On/Off and temperature switch; which is located right next to the heating plates... careful if you need to change the temperature or when turn it off, you can get burned easily. Other than that it is a great deal!",4
"I received the straighter on time and it works amazing!! I am glad I opted not to go with the chi, this works just as good if not better!",5
"I love the straightener. It works wonders on my hair. Most straighteners leave my hair feeling kind of dry. The argan oil, however, is an awesome addition! It leaves my hair feeling smooth and not dry at all.Also, it shipped very quickly, before the date they initially said. The box the product came in is also very nifty. I love that it came with a glove as well, although I don't think that I'll use it because most straighteners can almost burn your skin, but I haven't had that issue with the HSI, at all.Love it. Five stars!",5
First let me start by saying I now buy practically everything from Amazon.  I can ALWAYS count on super fast delivery and great deals!!  I purchased this flat iron because of the reviews it received and the price.  I am happy to say I just love this product.  I have relatives that own the more expensive CHI flat iron and I know they wished they had saved their money and bought this one.  I can get my hair straight with just one pass with this flat iron and I'm no pro at using them.  Thank goodness it came with the glove because I have long hair and the glove protects my hand.  I would recommend the HSI flat iron over all of the flat irons out there!!!,5
Great product at a great price. Its my new best friend! I have terribly uncontrollable frizzy hair and I am lazy so ive always worn it long and curly via lots of product. But with this I don't even have to blow dry. I especially love the glove genius idea!,5
"This is the first hair straightener I have ever bought. I wanted one that would straighten and curl/flip the ends. this one does of those things and does it well.I have very long, highlighted blond hair. I use this iron with the HSI argan oil sample they sent with it, plus Oribe royal blow out and my hair looks fab.It heats up quickly and is easy to use. I think the price is wonderful, I would imagine it's just as good at the chi or other really expensive brands. I could never justifyspending over $50 on something like this, and this straightener was the perfect choice for me because of the quality and the price.I would highly recommend you purchase it.",4
"I have very curly hair and this iron worked great at smoothing my curls out. I just combed out a piece of hair, ran the iron over it a couple of times, and I have smooth, straight hair. I like that it has very high settings so I can adjust my heat depending on how curly my hair is at the time I'm using it.",4
"-After reading the reviews on this flat iron I knew I had to get it, especially with the cost being so reasonable.  I got it for my daughter and I to share, since hers is a wet-to-dry one that isn't the best quality and mine died.-The package arrived a day early, which was great because we were due to go on vacation the next day.  I plugged it in and what do you know, there IS a light that goes from red to green when the iron is up to temperature.  It's on the outside, on the diamond pattern about halfway down on the one side.  It does work on my unit.  I used the sample of argon oil, you don't need much so I still have some left.  I may order that too, not sure on that.-Aware of other reviews mentioning it, I looked for but didn't see that you're not supposed to put it on any surface.  But to be safe I just layed it on the glove that was also included.  If you keep your hands on the textured pattern of the unit you won't need to wear the glove.  If you feel the need to grab the end to help curl your hair, for example, then yes use it.  It does stay hot for quite a while so if you're not traveling just let it cool off before putting it away.  I have a heat-resistant cover from my last flat iron that I use when I travel and need to put it away quickly.-Regarding the adjustable temperature, I'm very glad on that.  But I'm in a bit of a catch-22 because I have curly hair that's also colored.  For colored hair you're supposed to keep the temperature lower, but since it's also curly I chose to turn it up to medium-high so I don't have to make so many passes over my hair which would be damaging as well.-I needed no more than 2 passes to make my hair straight, smooth and shiny.  It does help to section your hair and use small sections too, it seems time consuming but it actually saves time in the long run.  I can easily get 2 days of straight hair from this unit, just need to touch it up.-This is why I only gave it 4 stars: I used it on a humid day and curled my hair with it...it looked great for about 10 minutes then drooped and got a bit frizzy, in spite of using 2 products that are supposed to prevent that.  So on humid days I'll just go curly or put it up :)-My daughter, who has thick, slightly wavy hair, LOVES it and would probably give it 5 stars.  She also doesn't have to do multiple passes over her hair which saves time and lessens damage.--Overall the HSI gets 4.5 stars!",4
"It is a great straightener, and I received it on time! They even sent me some Argan oil to use along with it! It is wonderful, and I am quite pleased!",5
This straightener is perfect for thick wavy frizzy hair! I usually take about an hour to do my hair but this cut me down to half the time! SOO WORTH THE PURCHASE!I recieved it in the exact time expected!,5
The item arrived within 48 hours which was fantastic.  I enjoy the fact that I can choose the heat setting.  It works great in straightening my hair and within one or two swipes.  Great item for a great price.  I'm glad I didn't invest $160 into a different product when it wasn't necessary.  I wish though their was detailed information from the manufacturer as to the specific features and how to use it/clean it etc.  I would rate this 4 out of 5.,4
"I have thick wavy, and hard to control hair. I am always looking for solutions and this happened to be one of them. I am happy with the product. It is built well and should last a long time.",4
"This is my first hair iron I have owned. I have naturally very straight, very fine, but very dense hair. My stylist recommended I try a straightening iron to get the type of curl I wanted, and for that purpose this iron works well. I haven't yet used the argan oil or the glove, as I haven't found the glove necessary (read: no burns yet), and I already own a bottle of argan oil. Overall, I like this product and I would definitely recommend based on the price and quality.The Seller also emailed me repeatedly, before I even got around to using the iron to make sure I was fully satisfied with it. So I would say the customer service is also very good.Solid buy.",4
I bought this product after reading the great reviews as a replacement for my Chi straightner. I am very happy with the quality and the performance of the straightner. I have very thick and long hair and it does a great job straightening it.,5
"I bought this for my wife after our new puppy chewed through the cord on her Farouk Chi. She was skeptical as we had never heard of the brand and the price seemed very low compared to other brands with the same features. After reading the reviews, we decided to give it a try. She absolutely loves it, it works better than her previous flat iron that cost twice as much. The iron gets to the desired temperature quickly. We have had it for almost two months now and she recommends it anytime anyone complements her on how beautiful her straight hair looks.",5
I have never tried flat irons in my life and I believe that this product has saved my life.  I have always had my hair in curls created with hair gel due to the humidity in Florida.  I now use this iron and my hair remains frizz free and soft looking for many days.  Thanks again.,4
"Works well, heats up quickly, solidly made, comfortable in my hands, comes with nice storage pouch. Nice product for the money.",4
"I have very ethnic hair and so does my daughter in law. We KNOW good irons and we KNOW crappy ones. I have had several Biolsilk and CHI irons in the past. CHI use to have an ethnic line of irons but they do not make them anymore--most newer irons do not get hot enough to straighten ethnic hair. I read the past reviews for this iron and decided to just give it a try.I am SO HAPPY!! Better than CHI--once you use it on a portion of hair your hair actually has that ""fly away"" look to it--like real hair :DSo--as far as efficiency with thick course wired ethnic hair--this iron is a great tool!",5
Love this product! Heats up super fast and and gives my hair awesome shine all day! Well worth the money!,5
"This flat iron is a rock star.The serum feels delicious, the thing heats in seconds, it swivels without sticking, straightens without pulling, and is obviously a solid hunk of well-made merchandise. I'm more than pleased with this little beast - it does exactly what my budget hoped it would.Gift this thing like crazy, you won't be disappointed.",5
"This straightener is a great size so it is very portable, and the price cannot be beaten. It comes in an awesome package with a bottle of Argan Oil and a great velour case to hold the iron in once it has cooled down. You won't be disappointed with this product. It is worth every penny if you have coarse or long hair.",5
"I got this straightener after after sending back a brand new Chi because it didn't heat well enough to do anything to my hair (and I have average thickness wavy hair). I love that this straightener has a varied heat setting so you can make it hotter or colder depending on YOUR hair. I also love that it heats fast and is easy to use. Would definitely buy again, even if this only lasts me 2 years!",5
"My wife is very happy with this product. it's not the same as the girl in the salon uses, but she says it works just as well and she doesn't have to go to the salon every time she needs to straighten her hair.",4
"Why buy an expensive flat iron?!? This one is great, and the price can't be beat. You will not regret buying this. I love it!",5
This is a great styling tool that works great!  I have tried many and this is the best one so far!!!  I am very happy with it and the price was right!,5
"I love this flat iron! I have been using it for over a month and it's perfect for styling my hair, straightening it or curling it. I am so happy with this product.",5
"Excellent value--much nicer than the ,similarly priced iron I had previously.  Nice iron, variable temp settings, heats quickly, hair looks great!!!",5
"So happy with my purchase. Received quickly and it was received as presented. Works great and fast in flattening my hair. I have thick, curly hair and have had difficulties in the past straightening my hair. No worries with this flat iron. Quick and easy and the product is of good quality.",5
"Very good flat iron. Rounded plate edges don't snag hair and allow to use as curling tool, as well.Came with glove and carrying bag.Heats up very quickly.Good product",4
"I love this product. It is the best straightener I've used. It was shipped fast. The straightener heats up fast, the manual tells you what temperature you should set it at for your hair type. It leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky. The 1 inch size makes it easy to store and travel with since it doesn't take up a lot of room.",5
"great flat iron considering the price, although i wish there was a higher temperature setting for my hair. comes with heat-resistant glove and argan oil.",4
"Purchased this product due to my niece recommending me use a professional style flat iron instead of the cheaper brands I had been using resulting in frizzy unkept looking hair.  She indicated she had paid over $100 for a Chi Styler and how she has never regretted it.  I read the reviews on the HSI style and found most everyone to rate it above the Chi Styler and the price was fantastic.  After receiving the product, I was well pleased with the luxury packaging, the sturdiness of the styler and the temperature settings.  Was also impressed with the hair oil sample also enclosed.",5
I really like this flat iron.  One swipe and hair is smooth and straight.  My only complaint is that the on/off and heat selections are on the innner side of the iron. Not very user friendly.  Other than that this is a great product with a great price.,4
"My hair is so thick that every  hair dresser I go to is surprised despite my warnings. I bought a straightener at a store and it does a decent job but is not hot enough so I end up taking a little longer trying to straighten it. The HSI has a temperature setting on it that allows me to set it to 410*. Now straightening my hair is even easier and faster.When you have as much hair as I do, fast is good.",5
It's a very good hair straightener. Does what it is supposed to in an easy fashion. Warms up quite fast. Easy to use.,5
I love the way this flatiron smoothes and straightens my hair. It heats up in no time. I also love the fact that my hair doesn't get caught in the sides of the iron.,5
"I am a black american with natural hair. I wanted to have an option to straighten my hair without adding chemicals. This is an absolutely awesome product! It straightened my hair so well that it looked like i used a hot comb or have a relaxer. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a straightener, especially if you had natural hair. The issue of the temperature dial and power switch on the inside of the tool is a non-issue for me.",5
"Very happy, used to use a Chi but when it broke I didn't want to pay another $100 for a straightner. I read other reviews, and gave this one a shot and so far I am very happy. I have to use it at the hottest setting, but it works beautifully. DEFINATELY reccomend!",5
I am very pleased with the Hair Straightener. It was just as described and works beautifully. It's such a good deal that I am trying to get my daughters to buy one too!,5
"This styler works about the same as my old one, but is better in that I can put it up to my head without it burning and it makes my hair feel softer afterwards",4
The item was better than I expected it's in brand new condition and works so great I just love it,5
"I recently purchased the HSI professional straightener for my daughter. Wow!! This product is amazing.  She has very coarse wavy hair and a lot of it. It used to take me hours to straighten her hair, and then within an hour it would frizz. This works in half the time with excellent results. I even use it on my thin straight hair for volume. Try this product..You will not be disappointed! Especially for the price! Excellent Product...Excellent Seller!",5
I knew I wasn't going to be purchasing an overpriced flat iron based on some name brand and I wanted a good one with adjustable temp. I couldn't be happier plus compared to pricing at other stores I got a great deal buying from this seller on Amazon. Love the flat iron and seller. No complaints,5
"The HSI Styler is the first iron I have used so I am unable to compare it with others.  It did heat quickly and just as quickly straightened my thick, wavy hair.  This morning I awoke to perfectly styled, straight hair.  How nice that all I have to do is comb it.  The only negative I have with this product is that the tiny controls are somewhat difficult to access as they are on the interior of the product.  I sense that this is really the only area where they can be placed; if they were to be put on the outside, the settings could inadvertently be changed to a higher temperature than one might want.",4
"This is my first flat iron and can say confidently that I am extremely satisfied with the HSI in performance and its ease of use. It does such an amazing job!Any flat iron protective oil will do but HSI's Argan oil tops any, leaving hair silky shiny and soft.THANKS for such a quality product.",5
"Fantastic product! Out performs similiar products by far. I highly recommend this product, the features are great with heat control settings and lasting effects.I am thrilled with this purchase as I have had similiar products that I paid alot more for and they were not as good as the HSI. This will be my flat iron choice from now on. You will not be disappointed with purchasing an HSI ceremic flat iron.",5
"I have thick frizzy hair, and went through at least 3 straighteners in past year, but this one makes my hair look silky smooth WITHOUT no products. heats up fast and smooth straightening the hair.  Exactly what I've been looking for in a straightener.",5
This product is the best flat iron I've ever had! I love the different heat settings. It makes my hair so smooth and silky looking. I would recommend it to a friend for sure!!,5
I recently purchased this HSI flat iron straightener for my wife after her CHI straightener stopped working. Not knowing a thing about straighteners I was immediately attracted to the significant cost savings on the HSI compared to others in the market but was worried that a lower cost equated to a cheaper product. Well she has been using it for over a week now and has repeatedly said it is better than the old one so this is a highly successful purchase! I not only saved us a bunch of money but got a feather in my cap too!,5
"I have tried almost every pricey flat iron on the market. This one is by far my favorite. For the price, it is definitely worth a try!!",5
This product works really well. Heats up fast and straightens hair quickly. I like the various settings for heat levels.,4
"I bought this for my daughter who has thick, coarse hair.  It heated quickly, and straightened in one pass leaving her hair with a really nice silky finish.  She usually has to do a couple passes with her old one.  We got this for an amazing price too.  About 80% off the usual retail.  It everything plus more than we expected.  Thank you!",5
"I just bought this flat iron about a week ago.  It arrived within two days.  It heats up very fast and seems to work as well as the professional flat iron my hair stylist uses.  It easily glides through my hair to straighten. I have noticed a huge difference in the texture and shine of my hair after using this flat iron versus my old one.  I do think the original price indicated is a bit off; but for under $50, it is worth the money.",5
"I am really happy with the product! The size is perfect, the material is high quality! I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this item to my friends and family.",5
"I recently purchased the HSI ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener from Blue Novelties on Amazon.  I needed a new straightener because mine stopped working.  When I received the package I was surprised to find out that this item works internationally on 220 volts as well as here in the United States.  This information was not apparent in the item description.  However, this is important because we are taking a trip to Europe later this year and I really depend on my straightener to keep my hair from frizzing in the humidity.  I understood from friends that the standard 220 volts they have in Europe would burn up any hair dryer or other small appliance purchased here in the United States so I was prepared to buy another one when we arrived at our destination.  Now I don't need to!  Along with my new straightener, I received a hand mitt to keep from burning my hand and a small bottle of argon oil.  The package also included a very nice quilted storage bag for the straightener.  I am very pleased with the quality of item received and with the fast shipping by Blue Novelties.  I will look to them next time I'm searching for a beauty item!  Thank you!",5
"This straightener worked exactly as described. I bought this because I didn't want to spend the money on a CHI Ionic Single Pass Ceramic Hairstyling Iron 1"", Designer Chameleon and I had heard this one was comparable. It straightens my (super thick and curly) hair, but the minute I get into humidity the poof is back. That is more a reflection on the quality of my hair and not so much the product. However, I did notice that with the Chi's silicone strip on their ionic straightener, I didn't seem to have that issue.Either way, this is a great quality for the price and I'd recommend it to anyone.",4
Great price for a professional straightener! I think I will have this one for a very long time! I am going to order more of these for gifts.,5
For the price I can't complain! Love all the accessories it came with as well! Would recommend for someone not wanting to spend an arm and a leg on a flat iron!,5
"This flat iron is amazing...and price ""unbeatable""....I have had a CHI for a few years, but it got broken recently in my luggage (thank you Southwest Airlines).....this is as good or better....!!!!!",5
"My wife has been asking me to buy a Flat Iron for the last two month. Finally, a week back we got this delivered. She is really happy with it. She loves all the features, how it works and what is more important for me.. she is happy with her hair! :-)Great product. I got an email from the vendor and it looks really serious and good.I recommend this product.Thanks",5
"I've only used it a couple times since I've received it. I have a lot and thick dark hair, so I'm pleased how this product makes my hair look so far for it's price. It leaves it shiny too, and I haven't even tried the gloss it comes with yet.",4
"I am so pleased with my HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron!  I have course, thick, frizzy hair and needed to find a straightener I could use quickly and efficiently.  I was a little nervous because the other straightener is the only brand I have ever used and was also used by my hair stylist. Now my hair feels great, is shiny and the plates are so smooth running over my hair-no pulling my hair out by the roots!  Best investment I ever made :)",5
"I love the HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron!!! I paid around $40 and feel like I got an awesome deal!  Since it has rounded edges, I use it to both straighten and curl my hair. I am very happy with this product.",5
"I bought this for my girl friend and she has never had a straightner that kept her hair straight for more the 4 hours, this kept it for 2 days!!! Awesome product!",5
"I've had flat irons before, but decided it was time for an upgrade.  The HSI has been working great for me.  I don't mind the dial heat setting, it gets to the point...hot,hotter,etc.  Prior to the HSI, I've never used an oil on my hair for a flat iron.  This has also been working well for me.  My hair is naturally unruly, and with other products my hair would start to frizz by mid-day.  With the HSI, my har stays smooth all day long, and it's been very humid lately.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it to a friend.",5
good product warms up quickly and does the job ..A little heavy maybe ..it works for me ..It is my first one it deos not do any dammage ot the hair,4
I ordered the HSI Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for a dear friend of mine. Hers was going out. This came at the perfect time. She is so impressed with it. She got it today(fast shipping too) and loves it. She says she cant wait to use it tomorrow. Cant say how wonderful it has been to deal with this seller!! Thanks so much!!,5
This product is as good if not even better that some of the models sold at top end stores. It is used daily and works perfectly.,5
"Seriously, I was not thinking when I decided to cut my hair short for summer. I figured it would be easy and perfect for the warmer weather. Who knew it takes so much more work to keep short hair looking decent?! As I was lamenting to one of my girlfriends, she told me she swore by this flat iron (I had been trying to get the weird waves out of my hair with a curling iron- omg, I know, right? I was a mess). Bought this and haven't looked back. Heats up super fast, and leaves my hair straight and shiny looking. I use it everyday now!",4
"Awesome hair straightener. Didn't know what to expect, especially since I never heard of the brand. After reading reviews, I decided to try it out, especially since it was at such a reasonable price. After trying out for the first time, I was extremely pleased. The hair straightener heated up fairly quickly and retained its heat through majority of its time used. It did a wonderful job of straightening my hair...have no regrets of purchase!",5
"This flat iron is, in my opinion, loads better than the chi. You can adjust the temperature, which is something you cannot do with a chi. This leaves my hair shiny, smooth, and straight. Other straighteners I've used have left my hair dull, semi-straight, and fried-looking. This straightener is also fantastic for curling the hair. I prefer it to curl my hair over my Conair curling wand.The only negative thing I have to say is that they don't include the holder/stand that I've found to be necessary if you don't want your room to smell like it's burning. Has anything burned yet? No. But it smells horrendous.I love this and recommend it for any current Chi user or if this is your first hair straightener!",4
"I was a little apprehensive to buy this product since I've never heard of HSI, but no regrets. I bought it during the lightning deal and paid less than $40. It was to replace an older flat iron that I burnt out after 5+ years of use. I received it promptly (thanks for fast delivery Amazon). I tried it out the day that I got it. I have course hair, so I set it at a high temperature (not the highest, but pretty close). I used it to curl my hair rather than to straighten it. This did an excellent job! My only complaint is that the temperature dial and the on/off switch is in a little awkward place, in between the two plates. I almost burned my hand turning it off. Hopefully, this will last.",4
Happy with my purchase so far! It heats up fast and straightens nice and smooth. My only con is the mouth doesn't open as wide as I am used to... not sure if that is standard or not. Not a huge deal tho. I don't see any problems happening with this product! The HSI oil is great and I love how it works too!,5
I bought this item for my wife who is very particular about what she uses on her hair. The item came right on time and was nicely packaged in a box with a bag and instructions. My wife absolutely loves the straightner and tells all her friends about it. It heats up very quickly and the controls are located nicely inside so you don't accidentally hit them. This will definitely be the only straightner she uses going forward.,5
"I was somewhat skeptical about how good this flat iron was for the price, but I assure you it is a high quality flat iron. And it works wonderfully.  My course hair is now smooth and silky.  I had been using a more expensive off brand flat iron that I bought from a beauty supply store and it mostly just burned my hair.  The HSI styler not only costs less than the other iron I was using, it is much better.  Definitely a great buy and compares to other professional quality irons I have used in the past.",5
Loved the great deal I got when I made this purchase for my daughter's birthday present.  My daughter loves it.  Shipped quickly.  Price was great too! Would definitely buy from this supplier again.  Thanks!,5
"So far, I like this flat iron, my previous Chi broke down after 3 months. This flat iron has temp. adjustment which will be less damaging to my fine hair. Good communication and very fast shipping! Thanks!",5
This flat iron makes short work of my super long hair. It does a wonderful job straightening my hair in only one pass! I would recommend this awesome iron to anyone. It works just as good if not better than the high end variety. Love it!,5
I received this product on time & it came with a sleeve for it and a sample of argon oil. Very pleased with it. Would definetly reccomend,5
"This straightener makes my hair much shinier than with my last straightener, a cheap drugstore one. People compliment my hair all the time, both on style and shine! Love it!",5
"I am very pleasantly surprised about the quality of this flat iron. I have another so I bought this for a back up iron because mine is a very expensive one, but this one is just as nice as the one I have.  I have not actually used it yet but will tomorrow as I have been too busy to actually spend much time working with it.  I am so glad I purchased it regardless!  Shipped was lightning fast also!",5
"Had my eye on this flatiron for a while. The great price made me transfer it from the wish list to the shopping cart. LOL.I added the HSI leave in, straighten, and curled my hair with this flat iron. My hair was left smooth, shiny, bouncy and soft looking. My hair eased through the plates without any snags. Received a satin pouch with a thermal lining inside, 5ml hsi leave in, and a glove. The swivel cord made using this product effortless. I'm very pleased. The side bonus of hsi made with argan oil made me a very happy customer.",5
"I've been straightening my hair with flat irons for 10 years.  Loved my Chi but it stopped working and I thought it might be fun to try something new.  So glad I did - the HSI Styler is completely AMAZING. Totally smooth, doesn't tug on hair, heats up quickly, and the results are fantastic -  my hair ended up super smooth and glossy. It came with a little vial of argan oil which smells great.  Price was great too. I'm completely thrilled with this purchase.",5
"I Love the temperature control, didn't have that on my last straightener. Heats up very quickly. Handle doesn't get too hot, so it's difficult to get burned. Overall, very happy! I was planning on buying a CHI, but I don't want that CHI any more. I love my new straightener and I can't stop playing with my hair!!!",5
"I absolutely love this flat iron.  I was skeptical at first since I've always used Chi, however after using HSI it is comparable or better than the Chi.  The price was a lot cheaper than the Chi too.  I highly recommend you try this product.  Another plus is you can adjust the heat setting to your type of hair, so you don't burn it.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"Got this for my wife, who is very happy with this straightener.Dual voltage is an added plus since we travel.",4
"I tried it once in mall but I didn't buy it because the price was too high. With the promotion price it is a super great deal. This product is awesome! Heated fast, and simple to use.",5
This is a great product. The HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron works exactly as advertised. It works just as well as my last flat iron by Ion (from Sally Beauty Supply) - which I loved. I use Mizani Iron Curl after washing and before blow drying. The combination of the Mizani Iron Curl and the HSI Flat Iron makes my thick curly hair bone straight and smooth as silk. It also comes with a pretty carrying case and sample of argan oil too! Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a flat iron that works effectively the first time and every time.,5
This is a top of the line straightener at a fantastic low price. The seller was fast and efficient and did a great job to get the product to me quickly. It is definitely professional grade and the best straightener I have ever used. Fantastic product. Would recommend all to buy this. Phenomenal deal!,5
I really like the straightener so far. The fast heat up and high heat make straightening a much faster process. It's not as excellent as it seemed to be regarded by other reviews. If it lasts a few years for me though I will count it as a good purchase =),4
"I was happy to own HSI flat iron and using it was really fantastic..I have used lots of hair flat irons with brand names and expensive ones but HSI flat iron is more effective. This HSI flat iron provides my unruly, coarse, curly hair to look great and straight.",5
"Recently, my flat iron of 7 years finally kicked the bucket.  I was really impressed with how many positive reviews the HSI flat iron had, especially for the price.  I decided to purchase one and have not been disappointed!  It heats up quickly and my hair actually stays incredibly straight, even on humid, damp days.  I haven't tried the sample oil it comes with but I can definitely vouch that the HSI's positive reviews are very legitimate.",5
I received this item the day after I ordered it shipping was very fast and the package was in great shape ...the flat irons are amazing I love them they're priced great and worked great as well I also enjoyed the free argon oil and heat protector glove that came with flat irons....I have also made an YouTube video under China0812doll about more information on the flat irons,5
you won't find anything better at this price. even the packaging is incredible. the item is as described and works great. my wife loves it.,5
"I bought this product after reading many reviews about several different flat irons. The reviews all said great things about this product. After recieving the product, just 1 day after purchase, I have to say I was very happy. The flat iron is brand new. It came in a sturdy box with a soft, red travel case for easy storage. It works wonderfully. It has settings for different hair types and heats up very quickly.Definately, a great purchase. Especially for the price. Very affordable and high quality.",5
"I'm happy with these straighteners - they are narrow enough that I can get close into my roots (and avoid an inch long curly wave at my roots).  The argan oil sample that came with the straighteners is also very nice and seemed to make a difference to my hair - it felt smoothy and less tangled, and doesn't seem to make my hair greasy.  Recommended.",5
"This is a great 1"" straightener.  I wanted something smaller to travel with, perfect!  Great price, gets hot quickly.  Comes with a glove & a nifty little carrying bag.",5
My wife & daughter live this product and their hair has never looked better. My wife looks 10 years younger :),5
I can totally see a difference in this straightner! I was actually quite suprised it works so much better than the same one at Wal-Mart for the price!,5
Great straightener for a great price! Would def recommend buying this one! Heats up within a minute and goes up to 140 degrees! Love it!,5
"I've used high end straightners before like GHD. Was looking for a more affordable straightner. HSI fits the bill. It came very nicely packaged and in a timely manner. However, did not heat up properly. On contacting the supplier via email, they troubleshooted the problem and sent me a replacement very quickly. The customer service is awesome. Happy to see that there are a few such companies that still care.About the product, the straightner does a decent job on straightening my long wavy hair. It takes slightly longer time than my previously owned GHD. I'm told the heating element is different than GHD and so it takes a little longer to do the job, but this will ultimately help in longer lifespan for the straightner. I'll have to wait and watch. So, Finally, I would say that I'm happy with my product. If you are looking for a good and affordable hair straightner, HSI is it.",4
This product is the best I have used. Better than the Chi. I love that you can set the heat temperature on it.,5
"I have purchased flat irons in the past and found that they just did not work that well.  I had to keep going over the hair to get it straight.  I ordered this HSI flat iron and found it to be excellent.  It works quickly and effectively, and I have found that my hair stays straight until my next shampoo.  I have medium length hair, however my daughter has long hair and she too has told me that it works well and that she does not have to flat iron her hair again, until the next time she shampoos it.  This is actually the second HSI I have purchased. Since the first one worked so well, I thought I would purchase another, so that I could have one to take on vacation, since my daughter and I were sharing the first one.",5
"My daughter is loving this straightener.  I did a lot of research and it paid off, this product is very good deal.",5
"The 1"" HSI Tourmeline Ionic Flat iron looks and feels like an expensive model, but the price was very reasonable.  After purchasing an expensive one that only lasted about 3 years, I've tried other brands, some cheaper and some a little more than the HSI, and none seemed to work as well.  I am very satisfied with this flat iron.  I also purchased the HSI flat iron stand and love how it safely cradles the iron right away when I'm done straightening my hair.",5
"This is the best straightener ever!I was at first worried that this would not be a good straightener due to the affordable price it was. I have bought many straighteners for this same price that wouldn't do anything for my hair but fry it. This HSI straightener is the best. My hair is hard to straighten and never holds a flat look for a day. This straightener happens to straighten my hair the first time it touches my hair and it stays straight all day long even after I sleep on it. Not only does it perfectly straighten my hair, it keeps it looking healthy and frizz-free. The first time I used it, people thought I had went to a professional to get it done! I definitely recommend this HSI straightener to everyone. Plus, the argon oil that comes with it smells amazing and does a wonderful job with the straightener on keeping my hair looking and smelling beautiful. You only have to use just a small dab of the oil and it goes a long way. If you are looking for a straightener that gets hair straight the first time it is run through your hair, this is the one to get and you won't be disappointed.",5
I have had at least 3 straighteners in the past and this one is by far my favorite. It heats up quickly and is very effective in getting rid of unmanagable hair. I love it!!,5
This was a great purchase shipped fast and very inexpensive. I had a Chi for 6 years and this flat iron is very comparable and maybe even better. I would recommend it.,5
"This is a phnemominal product. I purchased it to replace a salon style flat iron that I had for 5 years. I did a bit of research and this product had wonderful reviews, and had all the features i was looking for. The product gets very hot and very fast, which is a huge plus for me. The temperature control ranges from 140* and 410*. The product comes in a very nice red silk carry case for easy transport, and provides protection while traveling. product is highly recommended!",5
I love this flat iron!It is easy to use and gives me amazing looking hair. It made my hair very shiny and very soft. The argan oil included with the product is fantastic!,5
"I bought my first HSI 4 or 5 years ago at a kiosk in a local mall. The sales man/hairstyler told me he had the most amazing product on sale at $90, half off of its real value.  I was impressed with the product demo on my hair but wasn't convinced that it was worth $180.It turned out it was worth $180 or more. Shortly after my first purchase of HSI straightener I watched a beauty guru raving about her $200 hair straightener on YouTube. My straightener had everything hers had. It worked faithfully for about 5 years. One day it died with a spark. The cable on the straightener end was burnt and the copper wires were exposed. I was sad but pleasantly surprised to find an updated HSI at Amazon.The major differences between the older model and the newer one are: 1. The newer cable is softer and doesn't tangle easily. 2. The maximum temperature is now 410 (the older model had 400) 3. Black ceramic plate instead of beige plate.This straightener works beautifully and I've been using it everyday. I highly recommend this product to anybody who's looking for a decent hair straightener.",5
"My hair is super thick, long and coarse but with this flat iron. I can get my hair pin straight in under 30 minutes!! Only thing is your hair gets really hot so don't forget to use the glove that comes with it so you don't burn your hand.",5
"I ordered the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron after my previous (FHI) iron needed to be retired. I was considering re-buying the same item but the HSI iron was higher reviewed, reviewed by more people and at a cheaper price so I figured it was worth trying. So far I am glad that I did! I have only been using the product for a few weeks but it heats up quickly, has multiple temperature settings, and leaves my hair straight and soft! I am very happy I made the switch!",5
"I looked at lot of flat irons before making my purchase.I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and i was able to straighten and smooth my hair in less time than with my chi. It is a very well made quality item at an excellent price, don't pass this one up.",5
"No wonder this product has good reviews. It works very well on my hair (long and wavy) like my CHI flat iron. The advantage of HSI over CHI is the temperature adjustment. Sometimes the CHI flat iron becomes very hot and difficult to manage. So, i prefer using HSI and CHI will be my backup.",5
"I heard about this straightener a while ago and go it at a cheap price. It heats up fast and leaves my hair shiny,silky and smooth!But the argon oil bottle is so tiny so  i might buy another because it works soo well!",5
I have very thick hair that always frizzies no matter what. Been tired of using the same ole cheap straightener for Walmart that I get about once a year. Researched this brand and found great reviews. Seemed like a great deal with the freebies included. And I don't regret it one bit! It's smaller than the one I normally get which has a 2 inch straightener. This one is 1 inch. It was much smaller than used to but I am still Getting used to it. You can get under your hair real well with it being smaller and seems to straighten better that way. love it! And it was a great price on amazon,5
I love this product. It is easy to use and does a great job. Many other comparable irons cost double so this one is beyond worth the money. Would recommend it to anyone who asked.,5
"i originally wanted to purchase a GHD hair tongs , but after reading other comments and the massive price difference i took a gamble on these, cant not find a dual voltage switch but will find out when i go back to australai, heat up super quick and HOT which perfect for my hair the delivery was a day before estimated date , i also purchaced the tong holder which is also perfect can not find fault with either product ,just hope they are right about them being dual voltage,perfect and a good price as good as ghd and over 100 bucks cheaper , buy these ,",5
This item makes a great birthday present! My wife has owned many straighteners and she says this one is by far one of the best yet! Curls and straightens without catching and pulling hair! Highly recommended item,5
I bought this about 3 weeks ago after much searching on Amazon and review reading. I received an Amazon gift card for my birthday and since my old Ken Paves flat iron was not heating up and making my hair frizzy and I took the plunge on this one. Love it!! Not only does it heat up fast but I can actually style my hair so quick and easy. I wanted a flat iron that would allow me to curl my hair as well as straighten and this makes turning a breeze! You can't beat the sale price on this awesome flat iron!! Buy buy buy!!,5
"I have straight hair, so I've never felt like I needed a straightener. Then I cut my hair really short and when it grew back, it would dry all funky, so I thought it might be a good time to buy one. As a college student on a tight budget, I wanted one that wasn't exorbitantly expensive and after scouring amazon, I settled on this one because of the low price and high reviews. Well, it has exceeded my expectations. It heats up in less than 30 seconds, and using it in conjunction with the hair oil makes my hair sleek and shiny. Now I am no longer embarrassed to leave the house and since it was so inexpensive, I have money to spend!",5
I absolutely love this product. Was a fan of CHi until a new one gave out on me. Was a little hesitant to go elsewhere but decided it looked too good to pass up. I could not be happier with my new HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron. Works like a champ which is what I needed.,5
"I received my new HSI straightener about a week ago. I thought it was finally time to upgrade from my cheapo walmart brand. I have not yet been disappointed. I read some of the reviews before purchasing and one mentioned it was heavy. I don't think it ways more than the average straightener. Then again, I am not one to spend hours in front of the mirror in the morning.One thing I have noticed that I absolutley love is I don't need to touch it up as much. Usually my naturally wavy hair will bounce back overnight and I have to start all over. With the HSI, I spend less than 3 minutes touching it up.Another complaint was it didn't have an auto shut off... My previous one didn't either, so I figured no loss. The one before that didn't have an auto shut off but would automatically shut off because it was disfunctional. I personally find the auto shut off can be annoying. I do love how the light turns from red to green when it is hot, which it does rather quickly.Overall, I think it is a good product and would reccommend it to anyone. ESPECIALLY for the price!",4
Wow I just got my flat iron a couple of days ago I went from a big thick Afro to silky straight bouncy hair i can't stop touching my hair I love love it.,5
"I'm really impressed with this product. I'm so happy I bought it!! Best flat iron I've had in my life and I've had many different brands like CHI, Instyler, etc. It's very easy to use and it comes with the glove that makes everything easier. With this product i style my hair very fast and it last for so long I can't even believe it. Everybody is also telling me how good my hair looks, so shinny and silky. I'm very happy I bought it for such a good price. I would definitely buy again.",5
"It is a great iron. I have been using conair for a while, this one heats up faster and works very well.",5
"This product is amazing, and the description.of it is to the ' T'. Heats quick, easy to manage, lightweight, sleek and slim in your hands and cuts straightening time in HALF. Makes me feel like a pro, and be price is perfect. It leaves our hair soft and shiny just like you came from the salon. I have to keep others from taking it.",5
"I""m a professional hair stylist, The 'HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron' is a high quality pro iron w/ a killer feel and great results !simply put, u will NOT find a better pro iron for the price ( $40.00 ) this thing list for 299.00....ppl buy it !!!psmy only regret is that i didnt buy 2",5
This is a really good flat iron. As good as my Paul Mitchell iron at a 1/3 of the price. Would highly recommend this iron.,5
This flat iron works great!  So far I am very pleased with the product and feel that it straightens my hair easily and quickly.  I love that it has various tempatures because I have pretty thick hair.  I am vey pleased with my purchase.,5
"I actually got this brand confused with another and accidentally bought this one. Think of it as a generic version. Its really a no-name brand sold here on Amazon, but for the price I was surprisingly pleased. I noticed the difference when I first started using it. My hair does feel different, its smoother and doesn't feel as damaged. For my first ceramic straightener Im happy. Its good enough that I will wait until it breaks down to get a 'higher end' one. It did come with a random HSI brand hair oil sample that was a nice touch.",4
"great price, good hair straightener.  I was concerned that this wouldnt be as good as the Chi that i have used for the past several years, but I am very satisfied with this straightener.  It is slow to heat up, but is good after that.  Quick shipping.  I recommend this product.",4
"this is my first real flat iron. the reason for that is i always had relaxed hair and never felt the need for a flat iron. i've had long hair, really short hair and weave. the only time a flat iron has been used was when i went to a salon and my weave needed to be bone straight. lol. but for the past year i have gone natural and wanted a different look. i've left my hair naturally straight but i wanted something different which is really hard with my hair bc the first sign of humidity my hair kinks up. so i went on a wimb and purchased this flat iron. so far so good. it really makes my hair pin straight and i love that it comes with a sample bottle of argan oil. its really convenient bc of the swivel cord and it heats up pretty quick. so far im enjoying it.",4
"i really liked how well the product heated up and that the casing didn't get too hot to handle. i'm still on the fence about the argan oil, it did a good job of protecting my hair, but i'm not too hot on the smell.",4
"We purchased this IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER and it just does what it is supposed to do so perfectly!I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a straightener. The seller shipped it pretty fast as well.So, that is definitely a big plus.",5
"This flat iron is the best I have ever owned!I was a loyal chi customer for years, but this flat iron? Let me tell you... AMAZING!I will never buy a CHI again.Leaves hair soooo soft and flat.",5
"I upgraded to this from a drugstore brand. In love!! Works so well, even on extensions. I have super curly hair and it straightens with ease. The bonus oil makes my hair so smooth and shiny.",5
"I have to say the reviews really helped in making my decision not to by another CHI. I was worried at first because I have the world's worst unruly hair. It is thick, coarse, and curly! I usually get my hair thinned out every other month-seriously. The HSI leaves my hair shiny and soft all day- before even applying the wonderful argan oil they supply with this purchase. I ABSOLUTELY would recommend this product to ANY CHI user. Its a great buy and its way worth giving it a chance!!! Hope my review helps you- like the several others helped me. Bye bye CHI- HELLO HSI!!!",5
"After days of comparing straighteners on performance and price, I finally decided on this HSI. I used to have a CHI but it needed to be replaced. I like that you can control the tempature setting and it heats up fast, the red light on it turns green when it reaches the desired tempature. My hair doesn't get caught on the edge of the plates, the outside material doesn't get too hot to touch so I can hold it from both ends.  The cord swivels as you move it so the cord doesn't get tangled. My hair is wavy frizzy and it doesn't take long to smooth it out, my hairs looks shiny and it doesn't leave a burn smell. I'm very satisfied with my purchase, the price is reasonable.",5
"Whooaaaa!!! all I can say is ""wow"" really...with super fast delivery,This iron works so well with my hair, lasts all day and makes my hair real shinny...cant say enough, but thanks HSI/Amazon you guys are super!!",5
I love this flat iron!!!! My hair stayed straight and shiny even while sweating and getting generally grimy during a long day of traveling in this hot summer! It's easy to use and straightening is quicker than with my last flat iron.,5
"As soon as I got this I decided to try it out. It heated up within a minute. After using it on a section of hair, my hair was very smooth and straight. I also decided to try and curl with it. It made a very nice curl. I am glad I purchased this product.",5
I bought this product because if the price. I would buy it again because of how well it works!!  It is so much better than the Chi I had before!!  Highly recommend!!!,5
"I've been thinking for a while if I'll get this or a more expensive flat iron like CHI, so I opted to this since I'm Asian and close-fisted with money. HAHA.It works perfectly fine, shipping was fast, I got the bonus argan oil in a tiny little bottle. Heats up quickly, very handy.The only con is when I hold/grip it, the skin on the lower part of my thumb finger gets pinch sometimes..maybe I just need more practice in handling it, but so far so good. :)))",4
"Time for a new flat iron since humid weather plus wavy/frizzy hair equals disaster!  After reading the reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try and so very happy I did.  I can't tell you how much better this iron works at smoothing my hair than my old flat iron. The iron gets very hot and works quickly, there is a red ""on"" indicator light, the iron is hefty in weight and comfortable to hold and has a very long power cord.  I'm happy and non-frizzy haired! The huge plus of shopping with Amazon is their no-pain return policy.  I knew if the product didn't work or wasn't right for me, I could return it postage paid.",5
"I was really skeptical on purchasing this product because I didn't think anything could beat my Chi flat iron. Boy was I wrong! I took the chance, ordered it, got it in 2 days, tried it out and was surprised that my hair was silkier and straighter than what I usually get with my Chi. It heats up quickly and provides even amounts of heat throughout the heating plate. It is def. worth the $50 or so I spent on it compared to the $150+ that Chi goes for. It comes with a glove (I don't really use it), a cute red pouch to keep the iron in, and some nice leave in oil treatment for your hair. The oil treatment smells really good and feels great.",5
"Lightweight product doesn't tire your hand to hold or use. The adjustable heat setting allowed me to manage the heat so it wasn't too hot but hot enough to do the job without cooking my hair. Hair glides smoothly through the two plates. The cord is long enough to not need an extension cord. Comes with a handy storage pouch that holds the tool and cord. Took only a few minutes to complete my whole head of hair and, with the argan oil included with the tool, my hair was shiny and smooth and straight--and stated that way, with NO frizz--until I shampooed it again.",5
"I've been using straighteners for many years. It all started with the awesome Helen of Troy straightener. After this, I bought a Paul Mitchell straightener for $150. LOVED the straightener, but after 3 years my kitties knocked it off the bathroom counter and into the toilet. So alas, I was on the hunt again, but did not want to spend another $150. I'm do glad I ordered this. It really works very similar to my Paul Mitchell. It's a little thicker, but definitely leaves hair silky and shiny. Has different temp levels. The only thing I don't like is the amount of time it takes to heat up. I went from my 30 second heat up time with the Paul Mitchell to somewhere around 5 or 10 minutes. I guess that's the only con though.",4
"I would have given it five stars but I have to admit it is a bit on the heavy side. It keeps a steady temperature and doesn't take long at all to heat up. I actually bought it to keep me going while my professional salon flat iron is being repaired, but to be honest, the professional one might become my back up one in the drawer :)  The Argain Oil they provided was a great way to sample it and see if it works for you. It worked very well for me with my thick blonde hair, I thought it would make it look oily but just keep the oil on the bottom half of your hair, not for use up top. I would recommend this flat iron for sure.",4
Works really great! Love it ! I received it super fast too.Others seem to dry out my hair but not this one.,4
"Until I purchased the HSI I did not realize that the flat irons I have owned and borrowed in the past were pretty terrible. This thing glides through my hair like a knife through butter, even applying tension! The price versus the value make it a must have for any woman who frequently or occasionally wants smooth, straight, sleek hair!",5
"This iron is great! I love the packaging, and I think that the swivel cord is awesome for when you need to curl hair. It heats up in less then a minute, it's design is beautiful, and gives great results! I tried it on my cosmetology styling head, my niece, and my cousin. All with different textured hair, all ended with silky, smooth, and shiny hair. I might post photos up. Bottom line: This is an astonishing iron, especially for the price. You won't regret buying it!",5
"While the straightener works very smoothly, in order to straighten my thick, curly hair I had to turn up the heat level to maximum to get it to work for me.  It heats up quickly and while the first one I recieved was making a strange electrical, buzzing kind of noise that was worrisome while I was using it on the highest heat setting, the customer service person contacted me immediately and sent another one that works perfectly with no problem at all.  The free oil is a wonderful bonus, as is the wonderful thick, luxurious carrying pouch it provides.  I would highly recommend this product based on their excellent customer service alone!",5
"Amazing, went from wavey, nasty, dry, damaged, frizzy hair to silky soft straight! Only took one use and i was hooked! Cheep too!",5
I have thick wavey hair and this worked great in straightening it. Love that you can adjust the temperature.  Excellent price,5
"It's easy to see why I ordered this straightener, fantastic reviews, great price, and the product looks great...well it's all true. I love it! I've had it for a few days now, everything came just as advertised a couple days before the expected shipping date. It's so easy to use, get's got fast! The glove was too big for my small hands but I probably wouldn't bother with it anyway. I havent used the oil yet, but I'm sure I won't be disappointed. the straightener works great, curls amazingly, works great on bangs, works just as well as the professional salon straighteners. 100% satisfied with this product!!!",5
"I have thick, wavy hair and an a-line cut. This flat iron works just as great at the chi I previously used.",5
"I received this flat iron last week!  My old one broke so I had to buy a new one and thought I'd try this one out, sounded great for the price.  Everything arrived as it said it was supposed to with the Argan Oil and all.  It also does what it's supposed to do.  I have naturally curly hair so when I blow dry it I have frizzy hair that needs some help from a flat iron.  This flat iron does a great job and seems to do it much faster than my old one.  I was using a Helen of Troy Ceramic Flat Iron which worked well but this one maybe because of the heat and the oil works faster and I am able to do the cute curls and flips much easier than I was able to before.  It's a great buy for the price!  Enjoy!",5
My hair is naturally frizzy. After using this product if was silky smoothe and lasted the whole day! I love it and will recom it!,5
"Thanks for making my girlfriends hair straightener shopping easy, and affordable, great product, was a little hesitant going through Amazon. I don't usually shop online, but what a great experience she loves it way better than her old chi. Thanks again keep up the good work guys!",5
This is a wonderful flat iron.I have medium length frizzy hair and I get wonderful results.Would definitely recommend this to a friend!,5
I bought the straightener for my daughter.  She often wakes up with hairs going every which way. The HSI takes only minutes to heat up and I can run it through her hair making it silky soft.  We love it!,5
"just got my flat iron within two days in the mail and I'm in love. works great! and my hair looks amazing when i use the oil that it came with, wish it came with more oil but i guess ill have to buy more then",5
"After years of roller-setting my long hair, I recently got a new haircut which now requires me to air/blow-dry my now short hair and then use a flat-iron to smooth and style it.  I was really a little intimidated about using a flat iron. When I saw the reviews on Amazon, especially the one by other users who were ""new"" to ""flat-ironing"", I decided to try this product. All I can say now is ""WOW""! The HSI 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron is just a dream. It was so easy to use and handle and, did a terrific job! My friends thought I had gone to the beauty salon to get my hair done done. LOL. I HIGHLY recommend this product and the price is so great for the quality. The silk pouch is beautiful and the oil added a nice shine to my hair without appearing oily. If you're looking for a great flat iron, this is it!",5
"My third Chi broke after about a year's use - all three shorted out - and a friend recommended this straightener.  I was skeptical because I've tried lots of different brands and Chi was the ONLY one that would straighten my hair.  But since there were so many glowing reviews, I went for it.  For the price, why not?!  I LOOOOOOVE this straightener.  It works as well as the Chi if not better, and for a fraction of the price.  The only complaint I have is that it's not quite as smooth as the Chi when you're straightening your hair (a few hairs get caught and break off, but rarely).  And I love the oil that came with this!  Don't know if I'll ever splurge and pay the high price for the oil once my sample runs out, but I have to say I love it.I've only had the straightener a few weeks so we'll see how it holds up over time, but so far, so good!",5
"This is my first flat iron and overall I am pleased.Pros: gets hot quickly, heat is adequate, iron is a good weight, price was rightCons: nothing to do with the iron itself, more to do with the tedious process of straightening my hair! Several people mentioned the floating panels to be problematic. I didn't find that to be the case.",4
"My stylist straightened my hair and I just loved the silky feel to my normally thick and curly hair. I ordered the HSI from Amazon after reading the reviews. I love the bag that was included with the flat iron. The fact that you can adjust the temperature is a great feature to have. The only thing I would change on this iron would be putting the on/off switch on the outside of the handle, not the inside. It's not a big problem...you just have to be careful when turning off the appliance. My hair didn't turn out quite as good as when the stylist did it--but that's not the iron's fault. I just need to practice. Great price and prompt service. P.S. This is the Mrs. reviewing--Scot's hair is already straight. LOL",5
"After owning several flat irons in the past, I can say this one is the best I have tried for the price.  It did an excellent job of straightening with no frizz.",5
Purchased this flat iron to replace a cheap one I had bought years ago. Works really well - it only takes me a couple of minutes to straighten all my hair. It can get pretty hot though if you have it on the highest heat setting so it's advisable to wear the glove that's included if you're going to set it to max. I also like that my hair doesn't catch in the flat iron and rip it out like my old one did!,5
"I've just bought this product and used it a couple times already. I have thick hair and the HSI flat iron worked beautifully in them. It also straightened the hair very quickly. So far, it was worth buying.",4
"I love my new HSI Flat Iron. My old one just seemed to have worn out, but this one is so much better than my old one ever was. This new iron was half the price and its twice as good . I really love the way my hair comes out now.The style seems to hold better and longer because the heat is more intense.  You do not need to set it to the hottest, it is intensley hot at about 3/4 to full temp.",5
I love this product. It worth every single penny and more. My hair is super curly and after I use the flat iron it was so stray people asked me if I use the japanese straightener.,5
"Some times It's just hard to find the right flat iron for my wavy hair.  The flat iron I've previously used was perfect and last 7years. But the plastic around the ceramic plate stared to crack.  So I decided to purchase a new one. I've compared lots of products, read the reviews and decided to get this HSI 1"" ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron . I really happy about the product.  It straighten my hair perfectly.  I would recommend this product to everyone who has wavy or curly hair'",5
"I love this flat iron.  It the 3rd brand of flat iron that I have purchased and by far the best.  I have thicker hair and this straightens my hair with less effort than my previous flat irons, which means less damage to my hair.  Great product!",5
"Seriously this has been the best sale i have bought in my life. Gives an amazing shine to her, doesnt do much damage, brings all the tools necessary and adaptable.",5
"I am happy with this purchase. It works well, and arrived swiftly. I would recommend it to others. It heats and cools quickly, and works better than other straighteners I've owned and used that cost nearly twice as much.",5
"I was very upset when my previous straightening iron fell on the floor and broke.  After using this flat iron I realized it was the best thing that could have happened.  This thing is great!!  It straightens quickly without making my hair feel like it's getting damaged.  My hair looks better now than it ever did with my old iron, and you can't beat the price for the quality.  Highly recommend!",5
"I bought this because my CHI flat iron straightener no longer heats up. Was planning to buy another CHI when I saw that this product was highly recommended by a lot of users so I decided to try it myself.PROS:- dual voltage (110AC; 220AC) so you can bring it to other countries that have 220AC- temperature control; you can adjust the level of heat/temperature depending on the hair texture- reasonably pricedCONS:- the handle gets warmIn summary, it is definitely worth your money. Will consider buying another one as a spare. When my CHI broke, I had 4 consecutive terrible hair days until this product was delivered.",4
Heats very quickly and is heavy unlike some cheap plastic flat irons. My daughter loves how well it straightens.  The carrying case and glove were very nice. Highly recommend!  The price was awesome as well.,5
"My hair looks great and my hair is a little difficult to straighten. The trial oil left my hair very shiny. I would recommend these products, very high quality.",5
"This flat iron amazed me more than any other iron has. I purchased the HSI flat iron, half-expecting it to work on my 4a/b/c natural African American hair, but the price was right and the reviews impressed me so much that I wanted to give it a shot. I ordered it on a Sunday and received it Tuesday, which, although I was a Prime member, suprised me because I'd expected at least 2, regular business days (a ""plus"" for the service). I used it immediately and was awed, and completely satisfied with the results. When used in combination with the potent, sample Argan oil, the HSI flat iron left my normalLy thick, tightly coiled hair sleek, soft and silky. I couldn't have asked for a better iron (no exaggerations here!).*Synopsis: GO ON AND ORDER ONE TODAY BEFORE PEOPLE CATCH ON & THEY UP THE PRICE!! :)",5
"Im very satisfied with this straightener. It shipped very fast, straightens my hair very well and so glad i bought this instead the chi! Its so much cheaper than other good quality straighteners too!",5
"When I got this in October for $50 it was a really good straightener.... but within 20 uses it was not nearly as good but still did the job. Now, less than 8 months later, it is broken and I need a new straightener.",3
"I'm a latecomer to flat irons, because I've always liked my wavy/semi-curly hair, but a stylist thought it would be fun to style it straight at a recent appointment. I had never seen my hair straight before (really!), and it was pretty cute. Boyfriend liked it, too, so I hopped onto Amazon and found this flat iron and its great reviews. I don't plan to use it all the time, but when I do, I want the best quality I can find if it's going to be in direct contact with my hair. I'm still learning how to use it, but so far I've had good results, and my hair doesn't seem to be suffering at all. Very straight and silky. My stylist advised me to get a flat iron with variable temperature and to never use it on the highest setting, and I find that I do like that feature.Safety with these is obviously very important, so it would be better with auto shut-off, as another reviewer noted. But overall, I'm pleased with the purchase and highly recommend this item.",5
"First of all,the shipping was incredibly fast..I didn't expect it to be waiting on my doorstep so quick.On to the product.When I used it this morning for a date with my best girlfriends, I didn't expect for it to heat so quickly and smoothly. The iron slid down my hair in one nice glide and one glide was enough to straighten my hair perfectly along with a beautiful sheen, accompanied by the wonderful Argan oil that comes with the straightner. I couldn't stop touching my hair...it was so soft! The end result was nothing short of perfect. I'm highly satisfied with the quality of this product, and I will surely recommend it to all my girlies.The packaging was excellent as well, the straightner came with this sweet red satin case for storing away, along with your other products.",5
"nice little straightening iron.. shipped quickly, price was affordable with a lot of extras like the glove, pouch and argan oil sample.. does the job, heats quickly and really straightens.. i have long, thick, wavy/curly hair that is frizzy/coarse but was able to straighten it in 25 minute versus the usual 1 hour using my old flat iron.. happy with the results..",5
The product arrived on time with great packaging.  The product works beautifully along with the argain oil leave in hair treatment.  My hair never looked so good outside of a salon.  The iron also came with a protective case and a professional glove which was highly unexpected and a welcome addition to this package deal.  A great product at a great price.,5
"Got this flat iron last week after my one year old FHI broke on me...I was a bit skeptical given the price because it's such a good price and has such good reviews (too good to be true?). I will say that the vendor has been very good about following up with me to leave feedback on their company, as well as the item, so it is possible that they are better than other companies on Amazon about encouraging feedback, which explains the TONS of comments about this item. But in this case, I was going to leave product feedback regardless because I really think this is a good straightener.You can adjust the temp, it comes with a little pouch for traveling, and it seems to make my hair shinier and holds the ""straight"" longer. I have thick course hair that is very susceptible to heat and humidity ruining all my hard work straightening it, but this straightener has done a much better job of fighting the humidity. I even had a coworker point out to me that my hair looked straighter and better with my new iron...So far, I'm very pleased with my purchase and especially the price. Time will tell as to whether or not it holds up though, but I've very satisfied with my choice at this point. I'd definitely recommend.",5
I have never heard of HSI until I started looking around amazon for a new flat iron. I was looking at the CHI and BaByliss straighteners that were about $100. I've used my friends CHI several times and love how soft my hair was after using it and I wanted to finally spend the money to get my own. I stumbled across HSI for $47. I figured it was going to be another Wal-mart quality straightener since I have never heard of it. I was impressed that it had such good reviews from about 800 people and had a better rating than the CHI. After reading the reviews I decided to take the plunge and try it out. I thought I was only getting the Argan Oil and the flat iron but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with a pouch and the styling glove. The straightener heated quickly and easily glided through my hair. So my hair is in DIRE need of a haircut after an at home hair bleaching incident and it still straightened easily and left my hair feeling soft. I love my new HSI and I'm so glad I gave it a chance. Oh and I forgot to mention that it comes with a year warranty!,5
This is a HOT flat iron!! My hot tools crapped out on me and I didn't want to spend a fortune. No regrets here!!,5
"I have owned my Chi straightener for the past seven years. However, it recently wasn't getting as hot as it used to and the power only came on intermittently. I reviewed 1"" flat iron reviews for DAYS and deliberated over spending over $100 on another Chi or going with the Amazon reviews and buying the HSI flat iron. I had never heard of this brand before nor had my friend who is a hair stylist. I signed up for a free trial of Amazon prime and received the flat iron 3 days after placing my order. I use my flat iron primarily for straightening my blunt bangs and for curling the rest of my hair. I have to say that this iron works just as well as my Chi did when I first got it. I think that it gets hotter than my Chi ever did and I haven't even turned it up all the way yet. I love the green light that indicates when the iron is fully heated. In contrast to what some others have said about the grips on the outside of the iron, I enjoy having them as sometimes my hands will become slick with product with use. It is slightly heavier than my old Chi, but seems to be a sturdy product that will not easily break. All in all, it is half as much as the Chi and I am fully satisfied with the product thus far.",5
"I had never heard of this product but love it and the customer service was excellent, I got my straighener exactly as promised didn't have to wait and now my daughter and neice want one. Leave in hair treatment is awesome too, not greasy and doesn't leave your hair heavy. I use to use Paul Mitchell hair serum, not anymore. Thanks Blue Novelities too, your quick response was very helpful and professional,Love shopping on Amazon :)HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment",5
"I ordered the HSI 1"" Ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener and received it within a few days.  The product was exactly as described and exceeded; my expectations.  The straightener  heats up really fast and leaves my hair looking and feeling shiny and great.  They also sent a free 5 ml bottle of oil for hair treatment free of charge.",5
Very pleased with this flat iron...was looking at a CHI and would recommend this brand!  Heats up to 400 degrees too!,5
"Ive used this hair straightener twice already and i'm really satisfied. It straightens good and made my hair feel smooth and shiny. Its great, i love it! You wont be disappointed, trust me :)",5
I love this hsi flat iron. And for the price it is even better! I have used a Chi for the past few years but I love the end product of this a lot.  Its a more silky and shiny. I have purchased 3 now as gifts and everyone loves it! My Chi was twice the price and has held up well despite the poor reviews. But I will def be purchasing a 4th for myself soon instead of using my moms part time!!,5
"This hair straightener is definitely an upgrade from my $25 straightener from the grocery store.  It works much more quickly and just makes my hair look smoother and sleeker.  The only thing I don't like is that sometimes I feel like it's pulling a few hairs.  The way it clamps down, it just targets a few single hairs and then they pull and break, which is painful and also not great for my hair.  Perhaps the plates that I got on mine are just a little off on their alignment, I'm not sure.  Other than that, this hair straightener is great and definitely worth the $50 sale price.",4
Love this straightener! It heats up really quickly. I like that the plastic around the handle is thicker so I don't feel the heat on my hand. I have really thick long hair and it takes me almost no time to stranighten my hair. I only have to go over a section once. Also comes with a handy travel bag and a heat glove.,5
"This is my first time buying a flat iron hair straightener, and I am so amazed with the quality of this product and how well it works, for such a low price! This is definitely a must-have product; some features are:1) it has an on-off button2) a degree setting that goes to 410 degrees3) long power cord4) It comes with a beautiful case5) It comes with a bottle of Morocann Oilwhy I love it:1) high quality product2) affordable!3) it heats really fast4) it makes my hair really straight and shiny in a few minutesIn sum, if you don't want to spend a lot of money in an expensive flat iron, but you want a professional, high quality product to style your hair for a low price, buy this one, you'll love it!",5
"A lot of the reviews that I've read are from people that had Chi's and then tried this product.  I on the other hand, I have never had an expensive flat iron.  I've been using a cheap revlon flat iron that I had to run thru my wavy, frizzy hair four or five times just to get relatively straight hair...that rarely stayed straight...so I went on amazon and found this little gem.  I wanted a great iron but didn't want to pay big bucks for it.  This thing is amazing.  When it first arrived, I tried it out without any of the products I normally have to use...and my hair was silky, shiny, and very straight!!! This iron will not disappoint!! Would recommend for sure!",5
I purchased this item based on reviews and I am glad i trusted the other customers. This iron is wonderful.,5
"Gets good and hot. What I like best is even though it gets very straight, my hair still has body after using it. Like it a lot.",5
"HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair TreatmentI recently ordered the HSI Professional flat iron and couldn't be happier. I'm a licensed cosmetologist and have tried many different irons, including the chi, and would never go back to any of them. Great product, great price.",5
Amazing service and product!!  my straightener!!! Amazing low price for such a high end straightener!! You will definitely not be disappointed with this product!,5
"Very nice straightener that comes with a sleeve, hand glove, and straightening oil. Awesome value! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a high-quality straightener.",5
"I purchased this because my last hair straightener suddenly stopped working. In the past I've done a lot of research into which straightener to purchase, but my hair is a frizzy mess if I don't straighten it so I needed something ASAP so I wouldn't have to keep using the tiny travel straightener I have. I had actually first planned on going to my nearest CVS and buying whichever straightener they had, but they were sold out of them so I went to Amazon...Now that I have this one I'm glad I had those problems! I don't know if it's just that it's newer or what but it seems to be working a lot better than the old one, and the extras that come with it are great. There's a very nice bag for the straightener, what I assume is a glove to protect your hand from heat, and of course the argan oil. The cord is a good length and it heats very quickly too- I love the indicator light, which is red while it's heating up and green when it reaches the temperature you chose. Much better than previous straighteners I have which only had an indicator for whether it was turned on or not, so I had to just guess when it was done.The only thing I don't like about this straightener is that it doesn't have auto shutoff. The on/off switch is also a tiny bit awkward to reach, but at least you can't accidentally turn it off.",4
"I am relatively new to using a flat iron, so I was looking for a product that would work well but did not break the bank. I am so happy I bought this.  It is super easy to use, it works great and it does not damage my hair. It has a temperature control dial that you can adjust.  This product is worth buying.",5
"LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER. I also tried a Chi straightener when deciding and this one wins hands down. The HSI straightener heats up quicker, straightens my hair fast and smooth, and has a lovely heat control button that the Chi one doesn't have. I haven't really used the oil or the glove it comes with but it's a nice bonus. The bag it comes with is a great addition since I can put the iron in that while it cools.",5
This flat iron is awesome. Without having to spend too much money I received a high quality tool.  It straightens my hair effortlessly and without having to do multiple passes.,5
This flat iron has given me hair that I can run my fingers through! I was cursed with fine frizzy hair...and it is down to my waist. After using the HSI my hair is sleek and shiny and I actually received my first ever compliment on my hair! I suggest this product to anyone battling frizz and out of control hair.The iron slid over my hair and many times I only needed one pass to fully straighten my hair. Other people have commented on the hair catching in the iron...just ease up on the pressure a bit! The iron gets so hot you do not need to clamp down all the way to achieve smooth and straight hair.,5
"After reading lots of reviews on multiple flat irons, I made the decision to go with the HSI and I have no regrets. It heats up quickly, it's easy to use and leaves my hair sleek and shiny all day. I love the shape and weight, feels good in your hand and isn't too heavy.",4
I love this flat iron.  It is easy to use and works fast on my hair. I don't have to iron a ton of times to get it straight. Also the glove is a nice feature to not burn my hand.,5
"This hair straightener not only looks professional, it works like a professional hair straightener! I only have to go over my hair once or twice and it is pin STRAIGHT!! This straightener is lightweight, easy to use, and it performs astoundingly. For this price, this product is unbelievable!!! A hair straightener this good would sell for hundreds in the store, so thank you!!!",5
"I have owned several flat irons in the past.  Most have been mediocre.  This straightener is different.  To say my hair has a nature curl would be kind.  It's frizz.  We lived in Arizona and it was manageable with lesser irons because of the lack of humidity.  Then we moved to Connecticut and I soon realized I would need to invest in a better product, if I wanted to look my best.  After reading several reviews I decided to purchase the HSI 1"" Flat Iron Hair Straightener.Out of the box it feels good in your hand.  Not too heavy and can be easily manipulated in ones hand.  My husband and I chuckled a little at the included glove (which I had never had with any other straightener).  After using it for just a moment I realized why there was a glove.  The element produces so much heat I needed the glove.  As I said I hadn't had or needed a glove with any other flat iron before.  The iron has worked flawlessly and straightens difficult to manage hair in New England humidity without difficulty.Them my 4 year old decided to take the iron out of mommies drawer and give it a bath in the sink.  Oops.  My husband said ""buy another, it worked better than any other that you have owned.""  We let it dry out for a couple of days, and I hoped for the best as I plugged it in.  No Problem.  I am not saying that every straightener by HSI will withstand total submersion in water, but mine did.  Thus far I feel I have definitely received my money's worth.",5
"I have thick long hair, i love the HSI fkat iron because is:Easy to use & carry and the best of all: ""it give you a professional finish""travel overseas many times a year and the HSI flat iron is the first thing I pack because I can use it anywhere around the world.",5
Living on the coast my wife has all sorts of frizz with her hair and she loves this flatiron. She purchased a cheap one and decided to upgrade. This works great and heats up quick.,5
"This straightening iron works extremely well, and I got it for an amazing price - apparently about 75% off. It heats up almost immediately, which is essential for me because I have thick hair that is difficult to straighten. I bought it because of the previous user reviews, and I am not at all disappointed!",5
I was nervous buying a flat iron let alone one I have never heard of. I have to say this set far exceeded my expectations! I have super thick hair and once I am done using the flat iron my hair is so sleek and perfectly straight! I like the on/off switch and the fact you can change the heat setting with the dial. Again my hair is thick and the medium setting works very well and gets the job done. When using a flat iron you always want to use the lowest setting possible so as not to damage your hair. The flat iron is sturdy and solid yet easy to hold. Well built. You can tell it is of high quality. I bought this flat iron at a great price but honeslty if is worth full price. I love the cloth/sateen case. It is great for traveling. The glove is a nice bonus too. Make sure to use a heat styler and protectant on your hair first. Love love this iron and highly recommend!!,5
"Received extremely fast; great shipping; product works great-no complaints!!I would suggest this item to anyone; my hair is fairly thin so straightening is a breeze. The hot temperature setting would be perfect for my course hair, though.",5
"I saw a lot of mixed reviews of this product, but in my first week with this straightener, I have to say, it works great.  I have never had a CHI, and i had an old school straightener before.  I don't find that this takes a long time to heat up, I think most people have to remember to hit the ""reset button"" on the plug.  I find that the heat is great, I don't have to make as many runs through my hair for it to straighten (my hair is pretty fine), and the straight stays all day.  The case is nice too.  So I would recommend it, though I didn't get an Argain Oil sample.  Can't beat the price either for a ceramic tourmaline straightener.",4
"The minute I saw it out of its packaging it looked amazing! When I used it on my hair it seemed to convert my frizz ball of curls into smooth silk! My hair lasted like this for days, until it got wet from the rain!lol Other than that I would definitely recommend this flat iron.",5
This is the best flat iron out there for an amazing price. It makes my hair silky and straight and you can softly curl the ends with it too if you want. Doesn't over stress the hair and doesn't pull! Highly recommended and seller was prompt and attentive.,5
I have curly hair and so its important to me that the straightner I buy doesn't fry my hair. I originally bought a $200 straightner and was so totally unimpressed with it! It didn't straighten without kinks and didn't curl with out kinks! I came along the HSI and researched them and thought I'd give it a shot. I am SO HAPPY with this product! It doesn't burn my hair and it straightnes beautifully. Plus the arrangements oil trial sample they throw in is Phenom. The carry case they supply is a little small for it but if you wrap the cord correctly it can fit. All in all I would hut this straightner again! Its worth the money but it still doesn't break the bank!,5
"My hair is wavy, frizzy and fly away. I use this iron on the highest setting, and it  straightens my hair quickly. It is not difficult- does not pull or tangle hair- and is lightweight and very easy to use. I love it! I have not as yet had a chance to use the free bottle of oil included with the straightener.",5
"Best flat iron I have owned.  Heats up quick, and works on my wavy hair like a professional iron.  It was shipped very fast, and customer service was wonderful.  Five stars!!",5
"I love using it with the Argain Oil, it totally makes my hair shinier and healthier! Although I had a problem with the product, it was solved right after contacting customer service. I would totally recommend it to a friend because it works well and customer voice is valued by the company as well.",5
"I bought this item about two months ago. It had a small scratch on the corner of the plate but didn't seem to affect the quality of the product.  But right about the two month mark, the corner chipped off. Disappointed, I wrote the company that sent me the straightener. Told them what happened, and they immediately offered to send me a replacement. I got the new iron two days later. Talk about a positive experience! It's nice to have a company stand behind it's products! Thanks!",4
"Though not quite as quick to heat up as other flatirons I've owned, once the HSI is hot, it turns my long, wiry, Norwegian hair into shiny silk more like Asian hair. I love the way this flatiron makes my hair feel...and so does my boyfriend(!)",5
"I bought this flat iron as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  It seems to be very good quality and came with a storage pouch, heat resistant glove and small bottle of oil for your hair.  It leaves her hair shiny and smooth and does not damage it as her last inexpensive flat iron did.  Would definately recommend this product.",5
So far really liking my new flat iron.  I find it much hotter than the one I had before and glides through my hair much nicer.  I also like that the cord swivels around base.  One thing I do not like is that there is no auto shut off.,4
I love this hair straightener ! I prefer this over ANY thing. Including the chi. It makes my hair feel amazing & I have long & thick hair & it works perfect. One word for this : Amazing.,5
So far I'm very happy with this product.  I like that it has the feature of choosing your own temperature which is safer for your hair.,5
"very pleased with  this product  i had read previous reviews and was actually thinking about a chi product, but all of the previous chi users, spoke highly of this product.",4
"This straightener is great for my hair. It only takes a couple of passes for each section to be perfectly straight. The heat controls are a nice feature, too (something I haven't noticed on other straighteners I've tried). I think this one was definitely worth the money I spent.",5
Less expensive than other ceramic hair irons. Works very well on my daughters' long hair. I Would recommend to others.,5
"my hair looks straight and pretty! HSI works because it leaves it sleek and the hair treatment is absolutely helpful, and not to mention free! buy from blue novelties they are a great seller!",5
"Have tried several straighteners and I have thick, wavy hair. Found that the straightener heated up very quickly, and slid very nicely over my hair. Resulted in smooth, shiny, straight hair! Extremely pleased! And for under $50, it is definitely a great value!",5
"This is a good, salon quality flat iron for a great price. I used a Chi before and decided to take a chance on this one. Glad I did!",5
the temperature adjustment is very nice. Great product at a great price and arrived promptly. The one inch is so much better than my old two inch non-ceramic straight iron.,5
"I have SUPER fine hair and it is difficult to get it straight without it looking brittle... That's why I love this iron/ oil combo!!! My hair is SO soft and shiny, not brittle or lifeless at all : ) love it!!",5
"I bought this iron holder for my wife to hold her $200 flat iron and boy she couldn't be happier.Great product, great service and a very fast shipping, no brainer's choice!",5
I just wanted to let you know how impressed I was with your customer service on our product that stopped working! You handled it so professionally and so honestly! If everyone did things this way the world would be a lot happier of a place. Just super impressed and will do business again for sure. I will refer people to your business no doubt!Thanks again!,5
"It's a nice starter to the more high end irons. It is ceramic and all that. I mean it's a reasonably priced high end iron. It does snag the hair thought and that sucks. And the Argan oil they sent me spilled in the box all over my cute little pouch for the iron. I like it, and it's held up well. It worked great when I did my BKT. It does make me want to by a CHI or FHI now to see how much greater it can get!",4
"I love yhis flat iron, it works perfect for my thick hair.HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE HEAT CASE & GLOVE. DUAL VOLTAGE 110/220 IDEAL FOR TRAVEL",5
"This was my first hair straightener. I tried to copy what my hair dresser does, but I didn't succeed at first, but with a little practice it looks pretty good.  It is reasonably priced and I like the slip case and oil that came with it.",5
Don't give your money on expensive brands only for their names. This hair straightener gives you more quality than you could expect. I highly recommend it.,5
"I have bought everything from CHI to GHD straighteners; that have cost double if not triple what i paid for the HSI iron and I have to say, this item matches, if not beats the others products I've tried! Gets hot fast, has temperature control, doesn't burn my hair, and LEAVES it straight and shinny! LOVE LOVE LOVE this iron!",5
"I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience in buying this straightener.  My purchase arrived promptly, was as the buyer said it would be (brand new with a free sample), and most importantly it is a great product. I have used the straightener numerous times already in the week or so that I have had it and am impressed by the quality each and every time.  I have pretty curly hair and this particular straightener has absolutely no problem straightening it and making it feel extremely soft.  The Argain Oil is amazing as well, and really helps to lock in moisture and keep your ends from looking dry and brittle.  I would recommend the straightener,oil, and buyer to anybody!",5
I'm very happy with this straightener. I use to have a chi and I like HSI much more. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a straightner.,5
I have been looking around at stores to buy one and when I saw all the reviews on this one... I felt safe to purchase it.  Glad I did and I see why there are so many positive reviews.  It really is nice and a great price too.,5
It look to good to be true but it is a excellent hair iron. That I told friends of mine and two of then got one will worth it.,5
Great value for the money. Works better than some more expensive flat iron's I have tried. Great investment would give the product an A+ rating.,5
"This is my second straightener and I love it so much. This HSI makes my hair straight all day and also so satisfied to bought this from AMAZON. I place order Friday night and I got the package on Monday. So recommended. Moreover, this is also dual voltage so it's easy for someone who travel a lot.",5
"Having recently moved out of my house and having no other girls around, I found myself being flat iron-less. I scoured the internets looking for a flat iron that wouldn't break the bank, and this one kept coming up in my searches. I just used it for the first time and I was pleased with how my hair looked afterwards. Personally, I don't enjoy when my hair is pin straight. This flat iron straightened my hair but left it all volume-y, I think it was because it didn't get super hot (even on the highest setting). This is a pro or a con depending on how you like your hair to look.  I also received it sooner than I thought I would, since I opted for free shipping, which made me very happy. All in all, I think it was a great buy for the price. Another good thing about it is your hair won't get stuck in the hot plate thingys, so it's pain-free. All the free stuff that came with it was also cool.",4
Love this product. Well worth the price. Heats up quick and gets very hot. Threw out all my other flat irons and replaced it with this one. Excellent customer service.  Received item earlier than expected.,5
"After reading the other reviews, I was glad I got this straightener. At the highest setting, this does not burn the hair, just straightens it. I have shoulder length curly coarse hair and I love this HSI product. I wish the temp knob was somewhere else other than the inside, I don't want to burn myself.",5
"This is just as good as CHI or GHD, both of which I have had, and at a much more reasonable price. The quality is excellent.",5
My wife's old flat iron crapped out so I went online here to find a new one.We had not heard of HSI but took a chance from the reviews I read.My wife is happy and so am I.,5
Great product for an even better price. Works quite well as a straightener and produces amazing curls as the sides of the flat iron are rounded.,5
"I usually don't comment but felt I must this time. I carefully reviewed all written reviews for the various Chi and HSI irons. Almost  everything I needed to know  was  in the reviews.  The only thing not mentioned was that there is a ""ready"" light that indicates when the temperature set has been reached.  NICE surprise!  Also, there seems to be a piece of rubber attached to the iron that you could use to hang the iron when not in use??  I also am pleased with the ease of operation and how ergonomically correct it is to hold and manipulate to style my hair.  I would highly recommend this product over the chi, which is much more expensive and the HSI to me is much better all around.  I have long hair that is thick, wavy and fine.  I set the temperature lower than I  had to with the CHI and to my surprise I didn't have ""burning hair or hot lines ""  AND my hair was beautiful, shiny, smooth, silky:))  VERY PLEASED!!",5
"I LOVE this HSI straightener! I recently bought a CHI on Amazon, and had it for less then a month when it went out on me. I considered the HSI before the CHI, but hadn't heard of the brand, so I just got the CHI. Well, when it went out on me, I asked for a refund (which I got), and purchased the HSI. IT IS AMAZING. It's got a dial for the temperature and a silky bag to keep it in. It gets hot really quickly and cools down just as quick. THANKS!",5
Bought this flat iron to take on my trip to Italy.  I  used it when I received it in the mail and it worked good.  Hope it works during my trip.,5
"It is hard to believe this flat iron is such a great price.  It heats fast, stays hot, and leaves my hair soft and straight.  I have thick, coarse, and unruly hair.  My hair has met its match!!What is even more amazing is fact that at this price you also get a pouch to put it in while it's still hot and you need to pack up.  This is a fantastic flat iron at an amazing price.",5
"I love this straightener!!  It heats up fast, leaves my hair feeling smooth and has an extra long cord.  The shipping was very fast and the argain oil is amazing!",5
"Since I had my hair straightened 2 months ago, I used this product only once to test it and liked it. I didn't like the hair treatment oil because of the strong fragrance.",5
I got this for my 17 year old daughter who recently went from very long to shoulder length hair. She had never used any type of styling tool. She was able to master this Flat Iron in one session. Her goal was to get the wispy flips at the ends. The rounded edges of this flat iron perfectly gave her the flips. I think I will try it next!,5
"We were in a bad situation. My wife's hair straightener died while we were on the road. I placed an order for your product and a couple of days later, your product was at our doorstep. She used it, loved it and your straightener saved the day!Turn out her much more expensive straightener was not dead. The power to the plug was but she keeps using yours! That is a recommendation if ever there was one!Buy it. Delivery quick, price fair and product works. What more do you want!",5
Super fast heat up!Doesn't snag or pull my fine hair at all.Glides through my hair effortlessly and smoothly.Highly recommended.,5
"This was a gift for my sister- her Chi had burned out and she needed a new straightener. I wanted to try a new brand since- in my opinion- Chi is overrated and overpriced. The HSI had fantastic reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. She LOVES it!! She started getting compliments on her hair after the first use. Thanks to HSI I look like a hero, and I didn't have to break the bank!",5
"I used to have a chi, but like a lot of other people who have one, the cord started shorting out and it would turn on and off while plugged in, eventually just quit working ;(. Then, I got taken by those guys at the kiosk, and bought an Amika flat iron - what a mistake! It didn't get very hot and took forever to straighten my hair. Though i loved my chi, I was reluctant to go back to buying another because it burned out on me just after one year.After looking around Amazon searching for other irons, I came across the HSI and saw that it got rave reviews...and for the price, it made it seem like a steal. I decided to get one and so glad I did. It heats up fast, works very similar to my chi, if not better, and i especially like the soft grip feel it has on the outside. I did notice the first few times using it, my hair had a faint burnt smell to it, but after many more uses, that smell doesn't appear anymore. Must have been because it was brand new or something, not sure. I would definitely recommend this flat iron because it works great and is worth every penny. Leaves my hair straight all day and makes it feel sleek and look shiny.",4
I bought it for my wife's birthday.She has used it and she loves it. It cameIn a fancy box and a fancy bag and it looked expensive. She was shocked when I told her the price. That was a good deal.My wife is happy with it and this makes me happy too.I would highly recommend it.,5
Love this straightener!!  my first one broke... Dropped it on the tile floor.  Had to have another one!!!  Love love love!,5
"I just received the HSI 1"" flat iron hair straightener. It heats up pretty fast,and it also straighten my hair the way that I like it. I enjoy the temp control and I will have more info later on how it perform with time. But I love it, love it, love it...",5
"I bought this flat iron for my daughter after reading so many positive reviews. I couldn't believe the price for such a highly-endorsed product. I have Amazon Prime, so it came very quickly (I LOVE Prime!)After trying out the flat iron for myself, I decided that I definitely wanted one as well. It got hot very quickly and made my hair very smooth and silky. I am not very skilled at using straighteners, but this one was easy to use. My daughter and I both LOVE this HSI product!",5
"My daughter has been asking for one of these hair irons for some time.  Although she has natural, silky straight hair, she hoped to learn how to use a flat-iron to make it wavy.  This iron is all we hoped it would be and more.  Plus, it is value-priced and an amazing deal as compared to other irons of the same calibre.  The seller was especially fast in shipping the iron.  It seemed to arrive the next day!",5
I love this flat iron! I had a chi..and i would say this works better! My hair is so straight now that i hhave been using it! Wont regret purchasing this flat iron!,5
"I have naturally curly hair, but with this flat iron you would never know! With my old iron I would have to go over the sections of hair multiple times in order to achieve what this does with one time! The only negative I have with the product is that it does not have an auto shut-off function. The sample bottle of Argain Oil works well too!",5
"As a novice flat iron user, I found this very easy to use and I am very happy with the product.  I haven't yet encountered any problems to complain about.  It heats up quickly, so is ready to use quickly.",5
"I did really like this flat iron, but I wasn't quite as impressed as I was expecting to be from all the other reviews. I do think it does a good job, but my hair is very thick and curly so it doesn't keep it as straight all day as many of the other reviews say that it does.",4
"I bought this for my wife because she had been wanting a new flat iron. Now that she has tried it, here are her thoughts.Pros:Does great for her flip.Good heat control, enough heat for her needs.Cord control seems to work wellHas a good weight.Con:The heat plates don't close flat without additional pressure compared to her old one. This will take a small adjustment time, so not a huge issue.Overall.  She likes it, I'm happy",4
"It's a really good flat iron! it really worth the price! My girlfriend and I are really happy with it, it's a great addition to our beauty parlor.",5
"Love this flat iron! Gives great results, the price is right, even like the little extras thrown in. The iron itself works great for straightening and curling, but I do notice that it pulls just a bit. So that's the only negative. So far mine has worked great, no problems with it conking out like other reviewers.",4
"Over all I found this iron easy to use even on my super thick, coarse, curly hair. It only took me about two tries to get the hang of it, and my hair looks great! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it does pull my hair, every pass my hair gets caught in the plates. Other than that it's perfect!",4
"My other straightener quit on me, so I was in a hurry to get a new one.  I looked around in stores and online, and read lots of customer reviews for various products.  This straightener seemed to be well-liked by all, and although I hadn't heard of the brand before I decided to give it a try.  This turned out to be a very rewarding purchase!  I hadn't realized how quick straightening my hair could be - which is saying something, b/c mine is pretty thick and crazy.  This tool gets hot and stays hot.  It's well designed and versatile.  I would happily recommend it!  And the cherry on top?  It's cheaper than a CHI!",5
"With all the 5 star reviews I was pretty much set up for perfection.  I was especially looking for a flat iron that did NOT catch any hair in the sides!  Well, I've pulled plenty of hair out with this one, unfortunately.  The Chis have a wrap-around ""hot plate"", and this one stops short at the sides, so perhaps this is the biggest reason why my daughter NEVER gets her hair stuck and pulled out with her Chi (I just didn't want the higher price tag).  I find that combing my hair out to complete silkiness BEFORE using the flat iron helps it not get stuck in the sides quite so much.Otherwise it's a nice flat iron.  Nothing unusual or special, but it gets the job done, which is the point!  Next time, however, I believe I'll bite the bullet and buy a Chi.",4
Purchased this for my teenager and she Highly recommends it. She owned other lower end brands and was not happy until now.,5
"This is a high quality professional flat iron. I love the floating plates, adjustable temperature setting, and size. I can straighten, flip, or curl my hair with this, eliminating the need for multiple styling tools. The price is just icing on the cake. What a bargain!",5
"After placing an order for a HSI, I COULD NOT wait to open it and try it out! My last hair straightener broke down on me, and I was desperate to get a new one. Unfortunately, when my hair air dries it isn't a pretty sight..in fact most wouldn't argue with the fact that it is often just plain scary...Months spent reading reviews finally paid off, after using this tool for the first time it was quick, and quite painless. One stoke to unkink, a second to soften. Lookin good is only a matter of minutes now!",5
"I bought this straightener for my youngest daughter so she would stop taking my Chi. Now I use it & my older daughter does to. It straightens much better than any I've ever used before. This was a surprise to me because it was only $60, came with a nice travel cover, & came with a small bottle of smoothing oil. In the past I've paid $100 & more for straighteners. This does the job better & with fewer repetitions. We LOVE it!",5
"I love it! I like the fact that you can set the heat level - don't want it getting too hot as I have coloured hair and don't want to damage it!  It heats up quickly, and I like the grip effect on the handles. To sum up, great product and real value for the money!",5
"I bought this HSI hair straightener because of the low price and the great reviews. I was needing a replacement for my old hair straightener, an FHI, that had begun to short out after about 6 years of use.When I received this new straightener, the first thing I noticed is that the wall plug was the safer, larger kind you find on a hair dryer, versus a regular plug that was on my old straightener. I was also pleased to see that this straightener came with a free bottle of Argain oil and a travel bag.On my first use, I noticed a big difference between this HSI straightener and my old FHI. After straightening, my hair was smoother. The updated tourmaline-ionic technology is great.I would recommend this straightener to anyone, regardless of their hair type. I have wavy-to-straight hair that requires smoothing of the lumps, bumps and frizz, especially in the back of my hair. I also live in humid Florida, where a straightener is a Godsend.",5
"The product arrived really quickly as always, with no issues. The flat iron works great! Best one I have owned by far.",5
"My package came on the date it was due, all in one piece, and it works great! I'm a very happy woman! :)",5
"I am very pleased with this purchase.  The price is excellent compared to similar models and the choice of heating temps./on and off switch, and movable cord is nice.  No more tangled cord.",5
nice product.  easy to use and not too heavy.  I like the indicator lite on the handle - changes from red to green.  heats up quickly - nice storage bag also,5
"This hair straightener is a great deal, I couldn't recommend it more. I've owned quite a few more expensive hair straighteners and this is by far my favorite. It heats up quickly and not only straightens my hair, but makes it healthier looking at the same time. Great buy!",5
I love flat irons and hair products. Of all the irons I have(4) these are the best. Will definitely by again.,5
I am a professional stylist and I love this flat iron. I have personally ordered several of them for my customers and have given the information to others that were interested in them based upon my recommendation.  I will continue to use these flat irons as long as they continue to offer a quality product.,5
"I needed a flat iron to take on a trip with me.  I already have a Chi but since it is not only mine I had to buy one, and almost bought another one until I read the reviews for this one on Amazon.  I had never heard of this brand but decided if I didn't like it I would return it.  You girls were NOT wrong!! It leaves my hair straight the whole day and it leaves it better than the Chi.  I am done in less than 5 minutes doing my hair, plus it heats up super fast.  If you are thinking between this and the Chi, save yourself a few bucks and go with this one.  You will not regret it.",5
"It does what is expected of it and it comes at a great price. If you're going to end up buying a straightener, get this one.",5
"Heats up really quickly, glides through hair really well, and is a great price.  I'm super glad I bought it.",5
"Super excited about my new straightener! Came quickly, works great and came with a free case and argon oil. So much better than my old conair although anything is probably better than that. I researched for about 6 months before purchasing and am happy about my decision.",5
"The flat iron is amazing!  I cannot believe I got it at such a great price.  It gets super hot, super quick. Will use this brand in the future!",5
I ordered the Tourmaline iron without knowing much about the product. It turned out to be one of my best buys. It works and looks great. Couldn't be happier with my find.,5
"I had a chi for 13 years until it finally broke the first day of vacation.  I have naturally thick and curly hair and swear by a flat iron.  I was skeptical about purchasing any other brand but I couldn't pass up the cost...a chi cost $150.  I have used it on several occasions and each time people have commented on my hair. The product is great and works fast, no need to go over each section more than once.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have an indicator light for when it's on and ready.",5
I absolutely love my new straightener! I have never spent alot on one before and thought maybe I should pay alittle more for one and I'm soooo glad I did!,5
"This flat iron heats up quickly, is easy to use, feels sturdy in one's hands and doesn't tangle due to a rotating electrical connection. Thus far, about two weeks in, I am fully satisfied with this purchase. I'd recommend this product to friends and family, as well as the Amazon community.",5
"The HSI straightener actually came faster than it said it would, and I loved it.  I've already used it many times and it is SOOO much better than the straightener I had before this one.  It takes about 2 min to heat up and I have thick hair so U put it on the hottest setting.  I really like it a lot--so far no problems!",5
My hair is very curly and the HSI does a wonderful job of straighting the curls. Can't go wrong with this purchase.,5
"After doing a lot of research, I decided to purchase the HSI 1"" ceramic flat iron. What a great decision! I absolutely love it!!! First off, although it gets super hot, it doesn't feel (or smell) like it's frying my hair. It glides very, very smoothly and doesn't catch my hair anywhere, even if I have a big section of hair clamped in it. I have wavy to curly hair, and this flat iron really does the trick with one pass. I've used the Chi in the past, but the HSI is a far better product all around. Another feature I like is the rounded edges as this allows you to use the flat iron for curling hair as well! This specific seller (not sure if all sellers do this) included a free bottle of the Argain Oil hair treatment which conditions and shines the hair. You only need a little bit of the product, so 5 ml should last a while. I put this on my hair when it was dry - really smoothed it out.All around, I highly recommend this product! Definitely the best flat iron I've ever used.",5
"I bought this iron because of the price and all the good reviews it seems to have. When it arrived it was exactly as described. It looks nice and glides thru my hair nicely. Doesn't catch or pull my hair like other irons I have tried. It has almost a soft texture to it so it feels nice on my hands, not just hard plastic. My only slight complaint is that it's about the same size as my other irons but this one seems kind of bulky and it's a tad heavy. Wish they could lighten it up a little or something. Anyhow, I have thin/fine hair and it works good and straightens my hair just fine. It's a flat iron ~ not some magic miracle tool like some of these reviews make it out to be. It's definitely worth the price (especially for solid ceramic plates) and works good for me.",4
"I am totally happy with my HS1 Flat Iron,  This is my second Flat Iron always used the Chi.....so I was a bit leary.  I received the product and I am very happy with it.  I would definately reccomend this product.  It does a great job and is very easy to use.  Thumbs up to this product!!",5
My CHI broke a few months ago and I bought a cheap straightener to replace it until I got another CHI. After awhile my hair was dull and very dry. I realized it must of been the straightener I was using. I searched Amazon and found this straightener. After the first use my hair was noticeably more shiny and healthy looking and feeling. Glad I got this product!,5
"I've always been pretty iffy when it comes to flat irons. I have very long, thick curly hair, and I like it to still hold a lot of body and bounce when it's straightened, and I've found that a lot of straighteners that smooth it also weigh it down. This flat iron doesn't do that! Even when I straighten from root to tip, it still has tons of volume to it. Also, I've got generally very healthy hair, but I recently got it ombred so it's more processed than usual. The ends that are light have more split ends than I'm used to and I've used a few straighteners that make them crispy and dry and feel like straw. I thought it was just something I was going to have to live with, but when I got this flat iron I was beyond pleasantly surprised by how soft my hair is all the way through. I can easily run my fingers through it all day without brushing it, which probably also has something to do with the Argon oil that comes with it (WHICH IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT AS WELL!) My only complaint is that it does sometimes snag and tug, but again that might have something to do with my hair being more processed on the ends. Overall I am EXTREMELY pleased with this product, more than worth the money!",5
"I am really happy with my purchase. Great price and came quickly, super excited about that.. Used it a few times and it works awesome!",5
"I just received the HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment and it is so much better then the Conair I was using. My hair is shiny and it glides smoothly through my hair without pulling. The nice long cord gives you plenty of mobility. I had researched before buying and for the price this was perfect for me. I was amazed at how fast I received it only three days after ordering. Really Happy with this purchase. Thank you, Deb3677",5
"With 3 females in the house we have many different tools that are used for hair design.  I bought this item at a very good price so everyone would have their own, no fighting.  that was a mistake as I shoulda bought 3 of these.  this one blows the others away.  this straightener seems to just do a better job thatn all the others.  your hair feels softer, smoother, less dry and brittle.  it doesnt seem to damage my hair like many of the others seem to do.Highly recommend this product.  Only drawback we have seen is it isn't in a 3 pack and it does seem to take a minute or 2 to warm up in comparison to other models(brands) we have.  but worth the wait!",5
"As a professional hair stylist, I found this product to be excellent~!!! Regulated heat makes this tool perfect for all types of hair.",5
Flat iron works really great. I have really thick hair and this works great on my hair. Also my daughter has thick hair and does a great job.,5
I've tried a lot of flat irons on my hair and this one was even better than my Chi.  Love the adjustable temp and swivel cord and so far it hasn't shorted out like my Chi eventually did.,5
"This is a GREAT flat iron!!! Salon quality and it's great for transforming frizzy, dull hair into gorgeous hair. This iron heats up quick comes with a small bottle of oil which works great. I give this flat iron 5 STARS! My hair is bouncy, is healthy, and looks like I just left the salon. I highly recommend!",5
"This is a really great product. I have thin, but curly volumized hair and it doesn't fry my hair at all. The only problem is where the temperature and off/on switch is. It is actually located in the inner part of the straightener. Not safe at all.",4
"It is very well made, easy to use and does a great job!  I would highly recommend this straightener to everyone!",5
"This flat iron is worth every penny spent on it. After years of using cheap flat irons on my thick, curly hair, I finally decided it was time to invest in one. The price was right for this particular one and after hearing good things about the brand, I went for it. It's awesome. My time spent on my hair went from forty-five frustrating minutes to fifteen-twenty minutes that were not frustrating at all. It heats up quickly, the outside plastic does not get too hot (and burn my fingers), and it leaves my hair silky and smooth! It also doesn't leave that awful burnt hair smell that would happen with my other flat irons. I am super pleased with this product and will be recommending it to everyone!",5
"I PURCHASED THIS FLAT IRON BECAUSE IT HAD ALL OF THE FEATURES I NEEDED IN A GREAT IRON. THE FIRST TIME I USED THE IRON IT MADE MY HAIR LOOK LIKE BUTTER. MY HAIR WAS SO STRAIGHT, MY ENDS WERE SILKY AND EXTREMELY SOFT, JUST WHAT I NEEDED IN A GREAT FLAT IRON. ALSO I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN DETERMINE HOW HOT I WANT MY IRON TO BE, SO THAT WAS AN EXTREME PLUS FOR ME. THE SMALL BOTTLE OF ARGAN OIL THAT WAS INCLUDED WAS I A NICE BONUS TO AN ALREADY GREAT PURCHASE. THE IRON IS EVERYTHING IT DESCRIBED AND MORE.",5
"This item replaced my Chi Wet to Dry.  The temperature adjustment is not in a very convenient place but I think that is by design so you don't accidently turn it up while styling.  You can't see the temperature that the unit is set to, it is more of an approximation.  I don't think the end gets as hot as the Chi which is a blessing since I would continually almost burn my fingers while pinching the end.  It seems like it is similar quality but just not as many bells and whistles which is great since it was 30% the cost of replacing the Chi Wet to dry.  I would purchase it again.",5
"I have opinionated hair...it curls sometimes, will lie down sometimes, but smooth and straight is not usually an option.  This iron and the oil really made a difference.  Hope it works as well for you.",5
"After trying several flat irons I came across the HSI Ionic Flat Iron, absoutely love it!! It does the same job as if you were having your hair done from a salon!!  Definetly would recommend to friends!",5
"Thought with thick, wavy, longish hair it would be nearly impossible to straighten it so quickly.  This item heats up fast, flattened my hair and probably saved me a small fortune going forward for trips to the salon.  I am very pleased with it and have already recommended it to others.",5
"Hi everyone, this amazing product exceeds our expectations, is very effective and easy to use. I will recommend it to anyone looking for a good product.HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment  You will love it.",5
"I bought this straightener to replace my broken Chi. It gets very hot, which is great, but I have some concerns about how well it holds its heat. Originally I got one that was defective and kept reheating while I straightened. The seller was great and sent a replacement, and it's definitely much better. But, I am still confused by the ready indicator light continually switching to red in the middle of straightening my hair. Overall, I think it's a very good straightener and I am happy with it, especially after my Chi broke. However, I don't love it the way some of the raving reviewers did. Good purchase and definitely worth the price, but not the best I have ever seen. Having said that, I would purchase again.",4
great product and service.  Shipped in less time then stated!!Great transaction.  Would gladly purchase from them again.  The product worked better than the last iron I had and the variable temperature setting is great.,5
"Excellent product, works very well, heats up quickly, stores easily, most importantly leaves hair looking smooth and silky.I am a very satisfied customer.I also really liked the argain oil !",5
I ordered this straightener for the hair as my granddaughter has extremely curly hair.  She is at the age where she wants to try new looks  and change the familiar  trademark of her  curly hair for a new look.  She has always been frustrated with managing her hair in the past.  I think that this will give her a new look.  Be wishing her well with your product.,5
"I have normal, slightly wavy hair. I started straightening my hair with a wet-to-straight hand-me-down straightener, and it fried my hair even if I only used it once a month.  I thought all straighteners were like this; it made my hair coarse and icky, and my hair wouldn't even stay straight for an hour.  I gave up on straightening, until my boyfriend insisted and offered to pay for a new one.  I started doing some research, and even though in all my searching I never heard of HSI, it had all the good qualities that I had heard people rave about, and the reviews were great, so I tried it.  It works FANTASTICALLY.  It doesn't fry my hair, it straightens without being at the max heat, my hair will STAY straight, and it actually leaves my hair SHINY.  I don't know how it makes it shiny, but it does; I can even make crazy amazing, beautiful CURLS with it.  I seriously love this straightener.  It was the best decision I could have made, and it wasn't insanely expensive. I would absolutely recommend this to others!",5
"As someone that has steadfastly refused to buy any flat iron straightener that cost 100+ dollars, I decided to order the HSI 1"" due to the great reviews on Amazon and the reasonable price.I have used it many times since receiving it last week, and it is by far, my favorite straightener ever. The high humidity where I live is a good test, and this one hasn't disappointed.",5
I am really enjoying this flat iron. It is easy to work with and I love the little bag that comes with it.,5
Very satisfied with product. Alot easier and safer to use than the cheap metal straightener I was using. I would recommend product and seller to anyone wanting a good quality straightener!,5
"Wonderful seller! A real wow on service, delivery and follow up. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron, one of my daughters who is hip and cool said, anyone who's anyone, knows this is the best flat iron and Mom, look at the price! I am so very happy with this product and seller, buy one, no two and have one handy for a last minute gift!",5
"I have really thick long hair that just started becoming curly. I have tried other flat irons but all they did was frizz my hair and make me want to cut it all off. I bought this flat iron after reading the reviews and I am really happy with it! I even brought it to my hairdresser at my last appointment for her to try it out and she fell in love with it too! The only she had, she paid $150 for it. I only paid $50 for mine and it works better than hers does. I am really impressed with the quality of this flat iron and I highly recommend it to everyone!",5
"I was trying to find a good flat iron online for a reasonable price and I stumbled unto this HSI flat iron. It had plenty of good reviews so I figured I'd give it a try. I have to say that I'm very impressed with it's performance. I have thick, wavy and frizzy hair, and it did a good job at taming it down and giving it a smooth, straight and shiny finish. It was really easy to create curls with this flat iron too, I wear my hair with curls now because of that, it doesn't take long to curl my hair either unlike my con air curling iron. Other things I like are the adjustable heat settings and the swivel cord attached to it, you can adjust the heat according to your hair type so it's not so damaging to your hair and the swivel cord makes it easier to style your hair. I did find this flat iron a little heavy though but that doesn't bother me. I didn't feel like it damaged my hair or anything, I use heat protectant before using the iron. I love this flat iron and would definitely recommend it. :)",5
Comes with a heat resistant glove and a nice carrying sleeve. I got this on the recommendation of my hairdresser. I love it! This iron heats up fast and gets hot! I have perfectly smooth hair.,5
"This flat iron has a great look and feel.  It comes in a nice satin bag and also included a free little bottle of oil leave in hair treatment which is a must have when flat ironing hair.  It heats up quickly and straightens my hair nicely and doesn't catch or pull my hair.  The size is perfect allowing me to have good control.  It was a great deal/great price, too...I received it just days after ordering it which was wonderful!  I recommend buying it!",5
"My hair always ""grows"" and gets fly-away as the day goes on. When I use this hair straightener, I don't have that problem any more. I really like that the controls are not where you hold it causing me to unintentionally change settings.",5
I really like the HSI Flat Iron. I've used a Chi for a couple of years now and loved it but it was wearing out.  I was skeptical if the HSI would even compare to the Chi.  But I was pleasantly surprised.,5
Great product and great first hair straightener I actually bought myself.  No more hand-me-downs from my sister.  LOVE IT.,5
"This is my first (and hopefully last) salon quality straightener.  I have straightened my hair since I was in my pre-teens, and could only afford the cheapy ones that didn't do a very good job.  After awhile I gave up on straightening my hair because of it fried my hair, and the cheapy straightners didn't even make it look that good.  After getting my hair highlighted and my stylist straightening my hair before I left, I was determined to find a salon quality straightner without paying a salon price.  I found this and TAH DAH!!! It has met or exceeded all of my expectations.  The first time I straightened my hair, my husband couldn't stop complimenting me on how good it looked (he had never complimented my hair when it was straight previously).  HSI, thanks for giving me a little more self-confidence! : )",5
"Just want to start by saying that the shipment of this item is very very quick. When I received this item by mail I was very very happy with the quality of this product. Better than most of the flat irons in the markets. very sterdy, I love the temp control that it has. It irons my wifes hair very quick and it heats up very very fast. We are very happy with this iron.",5
HSI - works for me.  I love the way my hair shines after just one pass.  The light turns green to indicate when it is ready making it easy to use.,5
"I love this product. Easy to use. Saves time gives better results in Less passesMuch better that other products twice the priceNo : PULLING, tugging on hair leaves hair feeling silkly smoothGreat investmentAnd the seller was amazingWould definitely recommend this product and seller",5
Very pleased it heats up fast and I have thick hair so I wasn't sure how it would straighten but it works wonderful,5
This product far exceeds expectations.  The price is well worth the money. The floating plates don't snag my hair at all!  Plates also heat up super fast and evenly. I love this product. I would buy this product again if I had to and I would buy it as a gift. I also believe it would be good for all hair types my hair is a medium course texture and it straightens my hair quickly. Nice smooth and sleek finish.  Love it!,5
"This is a great flat iron. I didn't know much about irons but this one has very good reviews on its page. This iron heats very quick and lets you hair very shinny. I just love it. Also, the seller was very fast and I received my item in few days. Recommend it  ;)",5
"I had a Chi for about 5 years that died on me a couple of weeks ago (it worked great in the time I had it).  I researched and then purchased this item on Amazon after reading all the great reviews (and the bad reviews seemed to be more about defective straighteners and not so much about this being a bad product when it was functional).I have used this straightener twice - and am very happy with the results.  It came with a satin storage sleeve and a glove which I have used both times as it makes straightening easier and quicker (I'm not the most graceful when it comes to using a hot iron so it is a good preventative measure I never thought about until I pulled it out of the box).  I did use a tiny bit of the oil, but not enough to form an opinion (it smells great - I just worry it will make my hair too oily as some leave in conditioners/oils do).  My previous staightener was 1.5 inches, but I definitely prefer the 1 inch plates as it makes it easier to curl the ends if I want (with the 1.5 inch it was awkward and fried the ends if I tried to do this).I will most certainly re-post if my straightener unexpectantly craps out, but so far I have had a very positive experience and consider this an exceptional value.  It definitely works as good as my Chi did, but keep in mind my Chi was 5 years old and one of the basic models when I bought it back then.  The selling company sent it on time and shipping was free.  I am very pleased :)",5
"I purchased this HSI 1"" Ceramic Hair Straightener for my granddaughter for Christmas.  It has really turned out to be her ""most favorite thing"" when she wants a different look, such as long straight hair, instead of her normal very curly hair.  It was a worth it, and now there aren't any more complaints.  She threw the other relic in the trash.",5
"Wow I ordered these yesterday and used my PRIME 2 day shipping, but surprise these arrived the next day. Very fast shipping!I opened the box and found more surprises, it came with a glove, oil and a case to keep the flat irons in. I was definitely not expecting that! For the price I was thinking too good to be true this must don't work good at all...... SURPRISE AGAIN these flat iron straighten my hair 100% better than my CHI's not to mention my CHI's broke after only being used lightly for 3 months!I LOVE these, they are awesome! Plus you can set your temperature which is a +!  These are definitely a must have take my word for it ! I don't usually review Amazon products but this one was full of surprises !",5
"just got my hsi flat iron today! came in a cute red pouch with small bottle of this hsi oil thingy a heat protected glove, the flat iron gets hot quickly it straightens great its DUAL VOLTAGE!!!!! LOVE THAT it curls beautifully i curled my hair real quickly to see how it would turn out it was beautiful very nice hard curls!",5
The hot iron works as well as the Chi I had prior which finally broke and this iron was priced much cheaper!  Has a hook on the end for hanging the iron up but also came with a case to store the iron in.  VERY pleased with this product!!,5
"This is the second one I have purchased. They both seem to work very good, quality of product is fabulous, built very well and amazon pricing was great.",5
This flat iron is the best I've had and the service wonderful as well.  A pleasure doing business with this company.  They really care.,5
This is the best flat iron I have purchased!  It straightens my hair beautifully and heats within a couple of minutes after you turn it on.,5
Works great. Heats up fast. Love the red carrying case. And my hair responds well to the Argain oil. You just use a little bit but it makes a big difference in your hair feeling smooth.,5
I have been using the iron every time I wash my hair and so far I have no complains. It does what it suppose to do. Great buy.,5
"I think that this is a great Hair Straightener.  I am glad I picked this particular one.  It does a wonderful job and leaves my hair nice and shiny.  I would highly recommend the HSI 1"" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener.",5
Starting out I have very thick wavy curly its hard to manage.  This product is the only one out there that is reasonably priced. Its easy to use and reliable it is worth the price I would highly recommend it. My hair is smooth and soft after use.  The temperature control is great so you can change for hair type.,5
"After using a high priced hair straightener for years, I was in the market for a new one.  I decided to go with the HSI, mostly because of the price.  I am happy that I did!  This hair straightener is great!  It heats up super fast, holds the heat well and is just large enough to work quickly through my hair.  I have mid-back length hair and it has a lot of wave.  I find that the HSI straightens very well, and stays straight!  The oil is really nice, I may need to invest in a larger size.  You can't go wrong with this hair straightener.",5
This iron is great! I have semi wavy hair that was hard to straighten until I bought this iron. Great product and a great price. Unbeatable!,5
"This is my first flat iron purchase.  I brought because of the great reviews.  Product does a great job with my hair, leaving it shiny and smooth.",5
"I ordered this straightener to replace another model made by another manufacturer.  Prior to selecting this product I did some research since I wanted to order a reasonably priced, quality product that was also half-way decent to my hair.  I try to minimize how much heat or products I use on my hair to avoid damage, but unless going au natural it is difficult to completely avoid tools/products.  Since my hair is fine I wanted a product with a temperature control and one with ceramic tourmaline plates.  This straightener was perfect in meeting my needs.  I have a friend who does hair and she stated some of the more popular, high-priced items (Chi) are not all they are cracked up to be so I don't solely rely on brands.  I am very satisfied with the product and will recommend it to others.  Besides a glove and the sample of Argain Oil, this product comes with a nicely-made, lined straightener bag in a rich shade of red.  Very classy.",5
This is the second HSI I have purchased from Blue Novelties.  I LOVE it!  I have VERY curly and coarse hair.... with the Argain Oil (included WITH the flat iron) and a touch of protective spray my very coarse curly hair is sleek and soft!  This flat iron never burns my hair...and it gets hot enough to straighten on the first pass!  Love the iron and thanks to Blue Novelties again for such a quick delivery time!,5
Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  After reading the reviews about this flat iron and understanding that the CHI that is sold on Amazon is not the salon quality we purchased this item.  So far she is loving it.,5
"With my straight hair a flat iron was not something I ever anticipated buying. But with this flat iron I can make my hair look shiny, smooth, and thick with lots of body and curve. It works on both dry and damp hair. I am still learning to use it, but am very happy with the easy of handling, the temperature control, and the durability (I dropped it on a concrete floor with no damage).  The satin pouch it came with is handy for traveling, but I usually keep my flat iron hanging on the wall from the molded-in loop at the base of the unit.  It also comes with a heat protective glove which I haven't used yet--would probably be handy if I had short hair. The Argain oil included with the flat iron is a nice bonus.  I would recommend this product which I have found to be easy to use and worth the cost. Hint:  be sure to check the reset button on the plug when you first use your flat iron.",5
I was concerned with having thick wavy hair that I would need a larger iron...  this one works great and having never done it before was able to straighten my hair without any burning of my skin or hair... great deal and great iron... I love it!,5
"This flat iron is amazing! I recommended 100%! Thank you for selling a great product for such an affordable price! Sincerely, happy customer :)",5
I decided last summer to get a body wave and it severely damaged my hair.  I wanted a straighter that would not cause more damage than I already had.  After searching and reading reviews I decided to give the HSI a try. I am very satisfied with this straightener. It straightens great and leaves my hair looking silky smoothe.  This is a great product at a very great price. I would highly recommend this straightener.,5
I have been using the instyler for 2 years and it was causing breakage.  Am so happy to have my locks tamed by something that does not damage my hair.  And the hair product given with the iron is great too.  Love the little pouch too.,5
"I love this flat iron over the Chic which I never owned but heard about it. It's lightweight, the velvet pouch and glove come in handy and love the end results. I would highly recommend this product. Kudos!!!",5
"I needed to replace my Hot Tools ceramic tourmaline flat iron that bit the dust after a year or so of use.  I loved the Hot Tools iron but thought it should have lasted longer.  I limped along using an old flat iron for a few weeks until my hair look terrible.  I did my research, found the HSI and its great reviews and decided to give it a try.  WOW!  I shared with my co-workers that I'd ordered it and brought it to work for everyone to check out when it was delivered.  We used a coffee break to ""do hair"" and everyone agreed that hair was silkier and more shiny after just one use.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and I love how my hair looks and feels. I straighten after washing and drying and my hair needs only minor touchups for days until the next shampoo.  The unit is easy to handle and use, love the swivel cord and adjustable heat control.  The only drawback I've seen, albeit a minor and manageable one, is the controls seem awkwardly placed.  I don't really have a better suggestion for where to place them but in my opinion their placement is odd.  May just be me.  I'd give this 5-stars on performance and price.  Great investment for anyone wanting to purchase a professional quality flat iron at a reasonable price. The Hot Tools iron didn't hold a candle to the HSI!",5
I've done plenty of reviews of hair products and was ready to try something new. I did my research and found this flat iron and thought it was a must have. After seeing the fabulous reviews on this company I knew I would be getting a good product and in the time it was promised. They did exactly what I thought they would do and am extremely pleased with their services. Definitely recommend this company for anything they have to offer.,5
Last month I purchased the HSI ceramic flat iron from Amazon. I did some online research before purchasing this product. The price was GREAT. The flat iron works great and doesn't scorch my hair.  I always have a good experience when ordering from Amazon.,5
My hair is very thick and course and extremely curly.  This iron is so good that I only need to run it through each section once and I'm done!  It cut my styling time in half!  It's sleek design feels great in my hands too. I'd reccomend this item to everyone with hard to manage hair.,5
"I've never owned a flat iron before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but after seeing my friend's hair after using some expensive straightener I decided to purchase one for myself. Unfortunately I couldn't afford anything expensive, but it happened that I found this HSI iron for a really good price and I purchased it. I received it very quickly, nicely packed and loved it after the first use. It didn't pull my hair, went very smoothly through it. The temperature control allows you to set it at your desired level. I've got the great final result in practicaly no time. I highly recommend this flat iron.",5
Pretty good product...temperature selection and indicator light are nice.  No tangle cord also a bonus.  It hasn't broken on me yet and I've had it for about a month.Update:  I've had it for a year and even taken it with me on a few trips.  I use at least once a week.  Still not broken...pretty good.,4
"My old flat iron was at least 3 years old and cost about $150. I didn't think it was heating up properly anymore so I started to look at new irons. I found the HSI 1"" ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron and I'm so glad I did. It heats up super-fast and just glides through my hair. I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far it seems to be a great product at a great price! Hope you like it too.",5
"This is a great iron and for the price. I've used many irons and this is one that I must say works to straighten my hair to a silky shine and smooth straight. I have very Thick, coarse hair but this iron does the trick. I am completely satisfied with this product.",5
"This product arrived very fast. It came with a really cool case and a glove to prevent burning. In the past, it had taken me hours and hours to straighten my hair, with this HSI it only took 40 mins....which seems long, but my hair is VERY VERY long and very curly. I would recommend this product immensely!!!!!",5
"I love this iron! It has professional grade plates but comes with a wonderful price tag. I wasn't going to get a cheap drugstore version because I wanted to curl the bottom of my hair every day and this iron does it just right for a great price, rather than a $200 or $300 salon grade flat iron. It also straightens pretty well as I have straightened out my hair after having it in a tight braid all day. It has a wide variety of temperatures from ~200 to ~400 degrees F so it works for all hair types. I highly recommend it and will be sure to buy this one again if mine wears out in a few years!",5
"I had been a loyal customer to HAI hair irons for years, but unfortunately, with as time went on their products became less dependable and of poor quality. Finding a new iron was not easy but I decided to give this one a try because of all the good reviews and it's affordable price.What i've found so far:It heats up quickly and it gets really hot.I don't use the glove that it comes with (but i've been straightning for years), but it could be useful.If you don't have a huge section, you don't have to go over it multiple times.I love the pouch it comes with. You're not supposed to put it in their while its hot but it's nice to keep it in there when not in use.I won't give it 5 stars because 1)I don't know how long it's going to last, and, 2)sometimes I feel it leaves my hair a little frizzy. I used the serum it comes with, but mostly all it does is smell nice.I have thick, black, curly hair. In case that helps anyone with their decision.I reccomend it, the price is good and so far, the iron is good.",4
"It has been a very long time since I have bought a hair straightener, but I am happy so far.  The straightener arrived a day early, was packed carefully, and came with a few features I didnt realize (including a cute red pouch).  I have only used the straightener once, but the day I used it, I went outside and it immediately started raining.  I only had an umbrella and figured my hair would be ruined, but it actually stayed straight for three more days (I was traveling).  The only thing I didnt expect was that the straightener was a little heavier than my old one (some Conair model from probably 5-10 years ago).Hope it helps!",5
"I bought this after my Chi iron broke. I've used the Chi for years and loved it, so I was a little worried about changing brands. I chose this one for the price, but after using it I would buy it over the Chi even at the same price. While they both work well at straightening hair, I think this one does a better where I want a little wave. Mine came with a case, a glove, and a little bottle of Argain oil - I couldn't ask for more!",5
"I had been trying to use a 2"" Conair flat iron I purchased many years ago, but it kept snagging and pulling my hair out. I decided to take a chance on this unit even though I thought I needed a 2"" iron. I have long hair. I was immediately in love! It heats up almost instantly and glide smoothly through my hair with not snagging. It now takes me less than 5 minutes to make my hair smooth and straight with no damage. I also really appreciated the sample bottle of the Argain Oil. It was just what I needed for my dry fine hair. I will be using that again.",5
"I bought this flat iron as a back up to my Chi 1 1/2"" and to do my bangs.  I was a little leery because of the low price but took a chance because of the great reviews.  I am so glad I did!  I now use it for all of my hair.  It does great for curls and they stay all day!  I would absolutely recommend this flat iron.",5
"Quick delivery, excellent product. This is a wonderful hair care product. I have thick, long, natural curly hair, with this iron I can go from curly to silky straight in no time!!",5
I bought 2 of these for 2 of my daughters for Christmas this past year.  One of my daughters accidentally dropped it and the plate cracked and she only had it for a couple of weeks.  I sent an email to HSI and explained that the plate on the flat iron had cracked.  After one or two emails they sent me a message telling me that they would take care of it and a new one would be shipped within the week.  They came through on their promise and I truly appreciate their wonderful customer service!  My daughters are very happy with their new flat irons!,4
I love my HSI flat iron! It heats up in seconds and is easy to use. It leaves my hair smooth and soft. I would highly recommend it! I have no complaints. Great customer service as well.,5
My girlfriend love it!!!. Now she can straighten her hair quicker than ever. The glove its very useful to grab the hair when your are using the iron. Comes with a bag.Highly recommended!!!.,5
"This is the best flat iron I have ever purchased. I was prepared to spend upwards of $100 on a Chi or Babyliss flat iron.  But when I read the positive reviews on this cheaper model, I decided to give it a try.  The positive reviews are RIGHT ON!!  This is a fabulous buy.  Doesn't ""pull"" my hair and leaves it straight and shiny.",5
Works wonderfully!  I paid $100 plus for a flat iron that I bought at the mall and misplaced it.  I needed one quick and so after reading ALL the great reviews on the HSI I thought I would give it a try.  It is great!,5
Fast delivery. Exactly what was listed. Great quality and works amazing.  I love the travel bag that comes with it and the glove...no more burning my hands when I straighten!,5
"It came on time. It works perfect. We have used only once, no problem yet. If there is I will later update my review. If not updated, then that means I am happy with the product.",5
"This flat iron was just what I was looking for. It is light weight, easy to use, and does a fantastic job. It straightens and smooths without drying out hair.",5
"I'm a hair stylist and the HSI flat iron has been wonderful. I can use it on multiple hair types thanks to the adjustable temperature. I just love this flat iron and so do my clients, they especially love the HSI argon oil for their hair and how smooth it comes out.",5
"Although I bought this for my daughter, I may have to buy myself one as well.  I rarely straighten my hair because I am mixed and it is so curly that it takes forever to flat iron.  I have an Instyler, but even that takes forever.  Well, I have made a new best friend in this flat iron!  It straightens my hair quickly and easily, and my hair is shiny and beautiful when I use it! I love it, and the price makes me love it even more.  My daughter wanted a Chi for her birthday, but after reading the reviews for this product, I decided to go with it figuring it would be worth it to try because of the great price.  My daughter loved it and is happy that I didn't go with the Chi.My advice is to get this flat iron before the price goes up!  It is worth well over what it costs!",5
"Shipment was received promptly.  Nice presentation, iron was in a satin bag.  Works like a charm and thanks for the free Tresomme!!",5
"I purchased the HSI flat iron after my 4 year old used my CHI to do her barbie's hair and ruined it. I have had the HSI flat iron for almost a month now and have found that it works just as well as my old CHI. It heats quickly and straightens my hair with just one run through. It included a protective glove for your hand, but I have not had to use it. I have not noticed the temperature on the external parts of the flat iron becoming to hot to handle. I was also able to purchase it at a great price, which was an added bonus. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new flat iron.",5
"This product blows the Chi straightener out of the water. My hair is straight, soft, and healthy within minutes. Also, my hair stays straight for longer, so I don't have to restyle it the next day.",5
"This product is so amazing. Different temps,  couldn't be happier with the product.My hair stylist was absolutely jealous.  I am sure she will buy one also",5
"So, I just got this and let me tell you this is a fantastic flat iron. It made my hair smooth, flat, & shiny! :)I have med-thick somewhat wavy hair and I only have to go over my hair 2x and viola great hair. This is one of the best purchases I have ever bought.You will not be disappointed. I love my hair now:)",5
"I  am very pleased with the hair straightener and it's ease of use.  It heats up quickly and makes it quick and easy to style my hair.  I haven't tried the oil yet, so can't comment on that yet.",5
"AWESOME flat iron for the price!!! My Chi flat iron recently stopped working and I purchased this flat iron to tide me over. I am so pleased with this one that I think once my Chi flat iron is fixed, it will remain in the cabinet as a backup.",5
"This straightener is fantastic. I was a little nervous when I ordered this because I had never heard of this brand before. All of the great ratings is what made my decision. I am so glad I went with this choice. I have had my Chi for 5 years. It still is working but I could tell it wasn't having that ""oomph"" it used to have. While searching for my next one I came across this one and was shocked by the low low price! With 500 5 star ratings I had to give it a shot! I have had it now for 2 weeks and love it! It literally takes 30 seconds to get ready for use! It is so quick! It leaves my hair so soft and silky! The only thing that they could add to make this the best out there is add a setting to where the hot iron would cut off after so long...just in case some one was to forget to turn it off! :)",5
"I really love this iron...what I really love is the fact that you don't have to go over the same hair twice to straighten, which will really help to keep hair looking and feeling healthy!  The Argain Oil is great and I think that it's a great idea to include it with the purchase of the iron...I'll definitely be buying more Argain Oil when it runs out!!",5
"I am very pleased with the HS1 straightener.  It lives up to the promise of the high heat and the smooth tourmaline plates.  I had a flat iron prior to this, that was a good iron, lasted about 3 years and I guess I dropped it a few times too many, and I paid over $100 for it, but this one for approx $50 is so much better, and the Argan oil is great.  I had never heard of the Argan oil before this.  Even without the oil though, you get straight, smooth hair, with no frizziness or flyaways.",5
"Amazing flat iron!! I'm use to using my 2"" wigo flat iron and loved it - it got misplaced after we moved so I had to get another one.  I was apprehensive about going to a 1"" but saw the HSI and read the reviews so decided to try it out ... I'm glad I did!! It's a great product - I have long, curly, thick hair and this iron glided through my hair effortlessly! I didn't have to go over my hair more than once for it to straighten it either! Also, it doesn't pull my hair out a lot like others I've used - don't get me wrong it does pull but only once in a while not w/every glide! Plus, I was surprised to find that I got the glove and storage pouch w/it so that was nice! As I thought they only came w/the $70 bundle but to my surprise they came w/mine too!! If you're looking for a well made flat iron that actually works this is the one for you!!",5
This was a great item. I love it. Very fast shipping and at a good price as well. would recommend if want a good iron at a great price.,5
It came in earlier then the date so i was excited about that..i love this hair straightener i always wanted a chii but this works just as good at a wayyy b9etter price thanks!,5
I bought this for my girlfriend after listening to her complain about her other one breaking. I know nothing about hair straighteners but I came on amazon anyway and looked at ratings on this item and apparently they were all dead on. She is in love with this thing. I am not basically a hero over a $50.00 hair straightener. Perfect transaction.,5
"so not only does this flat iron smooth out my hair AND my daughter's hair who has very thick, frizzy, wavy hair, but it stays straight for days...i think my fave part is the fact that i can straighten my hair, put it in a ponytail all day and when i let my hair down i dont have that ""hairtie bump"" i love this flat iron :)",5
"Very good iron but I bought one a couple years back from Sally's that was comparable for about $50. Tech tools, I believe is the brand. Honestly, can't decide if my HSI is better or not. Definitely is a little bulkier than my other one is. I'm not dissatisfied just not totally wowed.",4
"I read the reviews and was worried about the quality of the manufacturing. But since the price was about $50, I decided to take the risk. (I know many products come out of the same factory with different labels and cosmetic differences and figured this was the same type of deal.) It arrived quickly and in great condition. It works well and feels solid. No clicks, buzzing, noises or quirks. I have no complaints.I've used a GHD curling iron for about 3 years now and wanted to try a smaller barrel. (1"" vs 1.5"") The smaller width is easier for me to put a curl into my hair. Both straighten quickly, beautifully and leave a gorgeous shine. It's nice to be able to adjust the heat so now I go down a little and save those heat degrees from my hair.Bottom line is if you want a top line flat iron, do try this. It works as well as my $250 one for a fraction of the price. I'll post updates periodically on its durability.",5
"This is the first hair straightener I bought and I wished I got it sooner. I love it, I think it's better than getting a hair curler since this allows you to curl your hair too.",4
"I bought this straightener for my daughter because our other one finally died.  This one is so nice!  Our other one was nowhere as smooth as this one is.  Your hair glides right through it, and you can adjust the heat settings so you can find just the right temperature for your hair.  It works much faster than I thought it would.  We are very pleased!",5
"having fairly straight hair naturally, i recently got a haircut that requires a bit more styling than just letting it air-dry (as i have most of my life). i've always been a bit afraid of too much heat-styling, and after a lot of reviews decided to go with this iron.i love it! the packaging was amazingly cute and high-quality. i love the little travel bag that came with it. the glove is a nice touch too, though i don't really use it. the plastic outside the iron does not get very hot, so i don't have much fear of burning myself while styling. it also heats up pretty quickly, and i like the adjustable heat settings as well. overall, a great first product!",5
I love these flat irons!!!  My daughter has natural hair and they got her hair super straight and they even made her hair look healthier!!!  I love using them on both of us and I will soon be ordering another pair as a backup pair!!!!  I am so in love!!!!,5
"This is an overall great product. Makes myhair silly smooth no more fly aways or damagedhair. Would recommend to people with even the toughesthair, mine is very thick and wavy. Great great productfor a fraction of the original price!",5
This hair straightener gets hot really fast and the outside remains very cool so you don't have to worry about burning yourself. I also am very happy that the cord attachment can rotate so the cord never gets tangled.I am pretty happy with the product!,5
"I was kind of skeptical because of the price, although I went ahead and bought it. I tried it and it left my hair very nice and straight and shiny! My sister who has very course even liked it because she has a difficult time straightening her hair. I would definitely recommend it to my friends when they are shopping for a new straightener.",5
I heard about this iron and saw it on sale I had to try it out. when I first got it I was shocked with the speedy delv. I turn it on and WOW! I LOVE IT...my hair had this great shine and body. I have found my hair new best friend lol. Oh and my hair is thick and no relaxer but I like to wear my hair straight. Get this iron you will not be dissapointed it works wonders...,5
"My daughter just graduated from a very well known beauty school and as she attended she received the very best equipment, i.e. brushes, curling irons, straightners, blow dryer. This Flat Iron is even better than hers. It heats up within 60 seconds, for those in a hurry. And the way it straightens it uncomparable! WE recommend it for anyone who demands the best.",5
"I was a little hesitant getting this product because I hadn't heard of the brand before. I bought it in confidence that the other reviews I read were true...and they were! I love that this flat iron has adjustable heat settings. I have thick, Asian hair and it works wonderfully on it. You get that salon finish after each use. The red fabric case that it comes in is also very useful for travel. All in all, I am really happy with the product and the seller shipped it to me in record time. Thanks!",5
"This flat iron is of excellent quality!  It heats up fast, straightens hair, and comes with a cute red satin case.  The price is just right.",5
"This HSI flat iron is exceptional. I have wavy, frizzy hair and it works perfectly. I had to try it out a few times to get the hang of it, but once I did, it was easy to use.Thank you so much, I highly recommend this product.",5
I love this flat iron it makes your hair feel so good and the oil that comes with it smells good and works really well. I would buy another it is a great product and it came at a great price.,5
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  She actually requested this iron by name and made it very easy for me to shop for her.,5
"I love this flat iron.  It replaced a Chi Ceramic Ionic Flat iron that was several years old.  It wasn't a tourmaline ionic flat iron & this HSI is absolutely the best.  This flat iron made my hair much more shiny & silky feeling compared the Chi flat iron.  And, this was a great price.  Highly Recommend!!!",5
"I've used a farouk chi for the past 5 years and so far like my HSI better. I opted for the HSI after running into problems with finding a REAL chi on amazon- it is nearly impossible to find one for under $200 that is not a fake. The pros of the HSI in my opinion are that it doesn't pull my hair as much as the chi and is much more affordable. The cons: it takes much longer to heat up fully and cool down, about the same as a good quality curling iron. It also is a little heavier than the chi, so not as convenient for travelling purposes. Overall I am very satisfied with this product.",4
"I use the straightener everyday, does a great job straightning my hair but leaves my hair very dry. Not bad for your money.",3
I love this flat iron!  I can't believe I found such a great item at such a great price.  My FHI iron broke and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a replacement so I went with this one because the reviews were so great.  Well worth it!  Would definitely order again.,5
"This is a very nice iron for the price.  It takes some adjusting to get the correct temp, but once you find it, no problems.  It does sometimes snag a hair or 2, but otherwise very good.",4
I wanted a good professional straightener but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg -- this one works great for the price. excellent buy. would recommend to others.,5
"I bought this iron to replace my Chi, which I've had for about 4 years. I was looking for a new iron that wouldn't damage my hair as much as the Chi (my hair would usually smell burnt after using it). This iron doesn't necessarily cut down my styling time, but it doesn't damage or ""fry"" my hair at all (even though I put the temperature on max since I have a lot of hair and it's really thick). The iron glides through my hair without pulling any strands. I've used it to flat iron and curl my hair. It does a great job at both and it leaves my hair soft and smooth after straightening it.It's true what others have said about the indicator light. Sometimes it won't turn green at all, or it'll turn green and then read again. This doesn't really bother me though. I don't even check to see if the light is green; I just start using it after about 30 seconds or so. Overall, I'm very happy with this iron and so far have no complaints.",5
"This is the first flat iron that I have purchased that makes my hair nice and smooth.The iron is easy to operate, but it does get very hot.  My next purchase is going to be the stand for the flat iron.The last iron I purchased was very expensive and is not as good as this flat iron.  I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.",5
"I love this flat iron. It leaves your hair so shiny, and silky! It will also make a great gift for someone.",5
"I was gonna buy the one sold by Herstyler to match my flat iron but I am SOOOO glad I did not spend the $40 bucks for it!  This one is made of good quality, heavy duty and can also be used either on the counter or mounted on the wall!  I really like it and am happier it is off my counter to prevent cracking!  Cannot wait to try more of your products!  '",5
We have been very satisfied with this product thus far. It lives up to the excellent rating it has received so far. We hope to use this product for a long time.,5
I am very please with the hair straightener. I have used it almost every day since I bought it. I recommend it for daily use (with a heat protective serum for your hair). Great product.,5
"My oldest daughter wanted a new straightener for Christmas and I saw the reviews for this one were so positive that I decided to give it a whirl.  Well, not only did she absolutely love it and say it was by far the best one she'd ever used, but her sister started using it and wanted one of her own.  I had just purchased a Chi for her sister but she said this one worked even better.  I purchased a second one for her and now she uses it all the time and LOVES it.  She says she doesn't have to straighten sections more than once to get it to look smooth.  Just one pass does the trick, which means it takes half the time to do the job.",5
"I was very skeptical about ordering this flat iron because I had not heard this brand before. However, the price was very enticing. I used it twice already and I am extremely happy. I have very long curly hair and the HSI flat iron does the job right away. And a huge A+ for the design: it does NOT pull your hair! The small oil sample they sent me smells very good but I have not tried it yet. I highly recommend this product.",5
I have really thick hair and this iron takes care of it in no time.  I finally feel that I have control of my style.  The temperature settings are easy to adjust and my hair is left feeling smooth and looking shiney.  I liked the little bottle of oil treatment too.  This is well worth the money.,5
"This item was my best by yet on amazon, I got this for my daughter as a christmas gift and it work wonders i'm so happy with this investment.",5
Finally...I am not spending hours waiting for my two teenage daughters to finish straightening their hair! The price was reasonable and the product works extremely well.  We have been buying cheaper brands for years but these work faster and allow them to guide the straightener without burning their fingers.  We were very satisfied.,5
"I have pretty thick hair and it used to take me almost an hour to dry and straighten my hair.  I would have to straighten it with a brush and then use my iron to complete the job.  I hated having to do my hair!  Now, I can just dry my hair, without a brush and finish with the iron.  It took an hour chore down to about 20 minutes.  And, it works very well.  My hair looks better than it did when it took me an hour.  I don't know if this is just the difference between a normal, non-salon-type iron and a nicer, more expensive iron or not.  But, it was definitely worth the money!",5
Sent this to my best friend for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Great value and a great straightener that heats up fast and keeps hair smooth and shiny.,5
I got this Flat Iron as a Christmas gift for my niece. She has it for a couple weeks with no complaints.,5
"Wife loves it and uses it not only to straighten but curl. It is made very well. Seems sturdy and for my sake hopefully it will last forever..If you need a straightener, get this one!",5
I bought this flat iron as a x-mas gift for my girlfriend. She has used a couple of different flat irons and could never find one that she liked. She says this is the best flat iron she has ever used. It came with a glove that you can use so that you don't burn your hand and she loves the Argain oil. Thanks HSI for making me look like a shopping expert in my girlfriend's eyes. I would recommend this product to anyone.,5
My daughter got this flat iron for Christmas.  She could not be happier that she got one.  I like the fact it has an automatic shutoff just in case you forget to turn it off for any reason.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the dial to turn the setting is in a hard place to reach; otherwise it has been a great present.,4
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas! She absolutely loves it!! Now looking at buying one for myself! Shipment was fast and efficient, and great customer service.",5
"This flat iron is a great one.  The HSI 1"" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron is a great tool for smooth, sleek hair.  Since having my second child, my hair has decided to curl, and this flat iron has become a daily necessity.  It heats up to temperature quickly, is lightweight, and is a great price.  I'd recommend it to anyone wanting that healthy, shiny, straight look.",5
A nice professional iron straighter. Buy it and your hair will appreciate it. Used it a few times and no problems o far.love it.,5
Bought this straightener as a gift for my sister in law for Christmas. And she loved it. Said it was an amazing straightener. Would recommend for sure.,4
The product is a good size and feels very sturdy. It heats up quickly and does exactly what it is meant to do!I recommend this product for anyone looking to get a great hair straightener! My sister loves it.,5
"This is a great flat iron. It heats up very quickly and straightens (or curls) the hair effectively leaving it smooth, shiny and soft. My hair is naturally wavy, dry and frizzy. I live in Arizona where the super dry climate makes hair really hard to manage. I consider any flat iron that can tame hair living in Arizona to be superlative! And this one does it. I have straightened my hair and also created big ringlets quickly and easily with this iron.The iron has a dial to regulate the temperature of the iron from 140 to 410 degrees F. There is a little light on top which is red when you first turn it on and which changes to green when the iron has heated up and is at the temperature you specified with the temperature control dial.It also comes with a nice heat proof glove to handle your hot hair without burning your fingers, a very cute heat proof pouch made of red satin, and a tiny bottle of Argan oil. All very nice.I would definitely recommend this flat iron.",5
"I was a little hesitant before receiving this product however, when I received the tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener I was very pleased at how hot it gets in a short time. If I had to say something it would be that I wish it had a shut off timer and grips at the tip to hold when straightening the hair other than that, ""Love It"".",5
"My daughter in law has long and extremely curly hair.  She said it normally takes 45min to straighten.  The first time using this, she was done in 20!Great product at a great price,.  Was shipped with a  cracked plate but customer service was nice enough to exchange.EIGHT MONTHS LATER-Sadly, within 8 months, one side is already broken.  It makes electrical crackling noises and no longer gets hot.  If I wiggle the plate, I can get it to work in a pinch, but it quickly goes cold again.Not worth wasting your money on.",2
After reading a lot of the mixed reviews. I decided to go ahead and purchase this item.  I had another ceramic flat iron that fried my hair.  It still looked broken and damaged no matter how I styled it.  I have used this several times now and my hair actually looks healthier after being straightned with this flat iron.  I am happy I listened to all the positive reviews.  The only negative about this is that there is not an automatic shutoff if left on.  Thanks for a great product.,5
"This is a very nice flatiron, works very well and does seem to be professional quality. I am not at all disappointed and would buy it all over again.  The iron is sturdy, has a good length cord with a swivel, which is a must.  It heats up very quickly and to a maximum intense heat although the heat is adjustable.  I like that the power light changes from red to green once it has heated up and is ready.  Very nice product and the protective sleeve is pretty nice too!",5
"Product is amazing.Oil leaves hair shiny without the greasy look.GREAT PRICE. I will never buy another CHI.The case is an added plus, so adorable.",5
I have been searching for a flat iron that actually works on my naturally curly hair...and I finally found it! I really cannot believe how well it works! It takes only about 15 minutes to straighten my hair when it used to take about 50 minutes using my old one. Thank you for this amazing product!,5
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MA0QY2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleMy Daughter loved this flat Iron.....  It came right in time and packaged perfectly....Thank You so much... She was so excited as her old Chi had all kinds of problems...  I am really happy I researched and found this one...  She used it right away and said that it worked really good and she was thrilled.....,5
I absolutely love this product....it was just what I needed at the right price and professional quality. I'm African American and I was using the Instyler for about a year and don't get me wrong it worked well but I needed something that could give my hair a nice shine and sleek feel and the HSI Professional flat iron did just that! Never has me hair been so bouncy and shiny with just one stroke of my hair shaft. And I can curl my hair with it too. It saves me sooooo much time I will be purchasing a back up soon. Thanks for this great product Amazon!,5
"I got this for my wife and she loves it.  I was weary of how good it would be considering the deeply discounted price (and compared to the prices of other professional-level options), but figured it was worth a try - and this product did not disappoint.  My wife has very difficult hair and she said this iron tames it in under 15 min. (which used to take her over an hour with her old iron).  It also arrived in the mail faster than I expected.",5
"Purchased for a gift & seems to be perfect.  Arrived on time, easy to use, packaged nicely.Had read all the reviews & this seemed to be a top performer.",5
"This is only my second flat iron I have ever owned, but I really love it! I have short hair only a little past my ears so I really only use it on the sides, but it does a great job in straightening it!",5
"my wife does her hair with it, WAY BETTER THAN THE CHI, she curls and straightens her hair, I highly recommend it as an anniversary or Christmas gift",5
This is a very nice professional quality hair iron. The velvet bag is a nice touch to store the unit in. The holder for it is a must buy too.,5
This was the first flat iron I purchased and I wish I'd bought it earlier! I recently got a bob haircut and needed a straightening tool to keep my hair from flying all over the place. The salon recommended a $275 GHD iron and after doing some research I decided on the HSI. I only wish I had bought it when my hair was still long. I highly recommend this product! It arrived quickly and the red pouch is a nice bonus.,4
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  She has really wavy hair and this took the curve right out of it.  Heats up quick and gets the job done.  She's happy....so I'm happy.,5
I was very pleased with delivery of the flat iron.  Promt service and although the oil was not included in the package it arrived the next day. Also happy with the product.  This is my first purchase of a flat iron and so far it is good.,4
"This flat iron went above and beyond my expectations! It is hands down the greatest product I've ever owned. Quick heat up, reaches hot temps for flawless straightening and a solid luxury product! Look no further",5
"The HSI 1"" ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron works fine. It did not live up to what I was expecting and I think my friend's CHI is a little bit better. I like that the temperature can be adjusted, however I find that I use the hottest setting anyway. Just so you know, I have fine hair but a lot of it and it is curly. This product does snag my hair sometimes, but that seems to happen with every flat iron I've used. Overall I do like this flat iron as it gets the job done and my hair is quite shiny and soft after I use it. One thing I don't understand is the light. When the iron is turned on the light is red and at some point it turns green, but even after it has turned green it will change back and forth from red to green. I don't know what that means, but it still works fine.",4
"Surprisingly great!The reviews for this item were pretty consistently great but I was still somehow expecting an iron that was LESS good than a Chi. It exceeded all of my expectations and is my all-time favorite hair straightener.I have no complaints about the iron whatsoever (and I have very thick wavy hair that takes at least 45 mins to straighten all the way through).It arrived in a box identical to the picture, and has been keeping my hair looking great for well over 6 months.I couldn't recommend this more.",5
"Everyone told me to buy a CHI but didn't want to spend the money, the HSI received great reviews and for good reason...it's AMAZING! My daughter is mixed and has very thick, curly long hair...this is a ""one pass"" operation.  That's all it takes to get straight the first time.  I love the free sample of argan oil they give you, unfortunately I cannot find the exact same to buy so I purchased Moroccan Oil.  The two combined are amazing...tames the frizzies and keeps her hair straight with little to no touch ups till next wash.  You won't be dissappointed.",5
This was a very high quality flat iron. It was a gift and the recipient was very pleased with it and with the free bottle of Argain Oil treatment.,5
"I got this as a early Christmas present from my Boyfriend and let me tell you its AMAZING! He purchased it a week early because he thought it would take a wial to get here but it came so fast! :} I use this straightener every other day and its always leaves my hair shiny and silky ALL DAY LONG. I use the Brazilian Keratin therapy flat iron spray before I straighten and it helps a great deal also.I have the Fluffy, Body envy, wavy hair that doesn't like to stay straight all day and ends up waving up as soon as I exit my house, but this straightener keeps it pin straight. It also heats up sooo fast. Usually with my old straighteners, after parting my hair in sections I would still have to wait until the plate heated FULLY! but as soon as I plug this beauty in, its done BEFORE I'm done parting my hair. It usually took me a hour 2 get All of my hair straight but now it only takes me 20 mins.The only thing I don't like is that because the plates get so hot I have to ALWAYS use the glove. It also has a habit of taking its time cooling down after u use it and it takes some time waiting for the stubborn Lady to settle before storing.But I rather have a straightener hot and kicking rather then one that's warm and stinking! lol Corney I know.What I also like about this straightener too is that it doesn't leave the smell of burnt hair behind. Even using good-smelling heat spray, my other professional straighteners always left that horrible smell behind, and this doesn't. Whatever good-smelling spray I put in my hair before straightening its stays that smell, I even tend to lightly spray my hair with some amazing perfume after straightening as well, to give it that long-lasting sweetness all day long!My hair also tends to get greasy quicker right after straightening, but with this straightener I feel like I just came back from the salon all clean and fresh and it stays that way all day.My hair is sooo much healthier after I got this straightener, I haven't seen one split end or dry frizzy strand since I switched.I would DEFINITELY recommend buying this straightener if you have had the same problems I had for YEARS but all is solved because the HSI has saved my hair, and will save it for more years to come :} <333",5
"I was looking for a professional iron that would really straighten my very curly hair.  I have found it.  HSI does it.  This morning I let my hair go curly until it was completely dry, then straightened it.  After I was done, I didn't look like the same person that I started out as!!  Curly to Straight, love it.",5
"I was pleased with the looks and price of product, I am still undecided about the preformance. It doesn't seen to work as well as some of my flat irons in the past. My hair seems a little frayed after each use. But if you consider the price...you get what you pay for.",4
This straightner works great!!! It gets very hot and makes it easy to style your hair anyway you want. It comes with a glove which is nice because it does get hot. All and all its a really nice I would definately purchase another one.,5
"I have wavy hair that drives me nuts, so most days I use a straightener.  My old straightener was worn out, so I read reviews and settled on the HSI Tourmaline model.  I am very pleased with the quality of this straightener, especially for the cost.  It has easy-to-use temperature controls, sturdy handle with good grip, and it comes with a nice case.  It works great on my hair, and can even be used to curl the ends.",5
I got this flat iron as a gift for my wife & she keeps raving about how well it works!  There is a noticeable difference in the softness & sheen of her hair since using it vs. the cheap model she had before.  I think she would agree that this is a very recommendable & quality product.,5
"I have had the same straightner for a long time and it was horrible, took so much of my time and was damaging my hair.I just recently purchased the HSI 1"" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat iron and I love it! I am kicking myself for not buying it soonerWas a good price. Was a little nervous that it wasn't working that good but apparently I just needed to change the setting to higher temperture. Itdid take a little bit longer to heat up to ready but saved so much more time b/c Im not having to repeat the same sections of hair as with my other flat iron.I didn't get the flat iron holder, wish it came together. I have not yet gotten to try the argain oil",5
"I was very pleased with this flat iron. It is an upgrade from the last brand I had and it straightens much quicker and easier. That said, I do not have curly hair to begin with - but it makes mine poker straight very easily.",5
"This little thing works wonders! Heats up fast and keeps my hair smooth and not damaged looking like my old Walgreen's straightener did. I'm a guy and have a long fringe, but even on the parts of my hair where it is short I can still get in there and straighten it with this. Very pleased with the fast shipping too, would recommend to anyone looking for a great and affordable (when it's on sale, got mine for $44) straightener!",5
"Best straightener I have ever owned. My hair stays straight all day and it actually feels so soft. It doesn't pull my hair out and it honestly only takes me 5 minutes to straighten my whole head of hair and my hair is THICK and FRIZZY! All other straightners left my hair still poofy and a bit frizzy, but this one doesn't! YAY!!.Only problem: I have only used it twice but the green light never goes on. It stays red, so I don't know if this means it never gets hot enough or its never ready? This kind of worries me...Great product though. Hopefully mine doesn't have some sort of defect.",4
"I've had many flat irons and this one is by far the best. Gets very hot and straightened my hair very quickly leaving it shiny,  straight and frizz free.",5
I have been using this flat iron for about a week now and like it so much better than the Chi I had been using. This one glides over my hair much more smoothly and gives a nice shine. Excellent heat up time. My only complaint is about the temperature selector. It's a small knob located near the hinge inside the iron. It's a little awkward to make adjustments when the iron is already hot.,5
"I have always used a Chi fla tiron, but when I was shopping for a new one, I saw the HSI and read the reviews.  All reviews were positive and the price was lower, so I ordered it.  After receiving the iron and trying it out, I was sold!!  It straightens my hair perfectly and I like that it has a temperature control setting.  My hair was silky and smoothe after straightening.  The iron comes with a beautiful carrying bag and trial bottle of conditioning hair treatment. I would definitely recommend this flat iron!",5
"I bought this flat iron to replace another ceramic plated one that I had. I was hesitant about buying a new brand, especially at this price but the reviews were good so I thought I would try it. As soon as the iron arrived I had to test it out. I have really tight ringlet curls and thin hair. When I blow my hair out I give Chaka Khan competition, but never the less it is not corse and straightens fairly easily with a good iron. This iron heats up very quickly and works very well. I have only had it one week so I cannot say how long the ceramic plates are going to last. The only thing that I am really upset about is that the textured surface of the iron hurts my thumb and palm of my hand after continuously running the iron through my hair. Thank-goodness they give you a heat glove so you don't have to hold it that far down.",4
"I was just about to return this, when I read a review in another area from someone who had the same problem with this exact iron - she plugged it in, turned it 'on', but it would not heat up.  The person said to PRESS THE RED RESET BUTTON FIRMLY.  I did that and, now - tah dah - it works!!  (It's too bad it doesn't say to do that somewhere in the instructions.)  I love the swivel cord, and it's a longer cord than my last which makes it easier.  Plus, it doesn't snag my hair.  Now I am happy.  Yay.",4
This is the only flat iron that will straighten my difficult hair!  It does not leave my hair frizzy like most other brands do.  I like the different heat settings and the lightweight iron.  Definately a great purchase at a reasonable price.,5
"I was very happy with the fast, and reliable service offered.  The hair straightener is working great, and took less than a week after purchase to come!",5
"My daughter and I have very thick, curly hair but like to straighten it sometimes.  We have had a cheap straightener for a few years that would eventually get our hair pretty straight.  I decided it was time for something better, so got this one, and it works wonders.  It heats up fast, and straightens much better than the old one.  I would recommend this to anyone with curly or thick hair!",5
"I bought this for my daughter, so I can only go by what she tells me. This straightener cuts the time she needs for doing her hair by at least 25% maybe more. She loves it and for her hands it's very comfortable to use. She's only had it for a couple of months so we don't know how long it will last. If it works well for a couple of years or so, well rate it as being perfect. Time will tell.",5
Bought this straightener for my teenage daughters and they love it. They both have wavy/curly hair and it works just as well and better than the high-dollar straighteners we have bought in the past.,5
I never owned flat iron before and before I purchased this one I did my homework. It is perfect for my needs.,5
I really like this flat iron.  I am a african american and it straighten my hair with one swipe no more than two at the most.  It heats up really fast.  Don't waste your money buying a expensive one buy this you will not be disappointed.  The packaging was very impressive too.  It came with a red bag great for traveling. I would recommend for anyone who wants to straighten hair fast.,5
Great product...made my hair so smooth...and I have tried many products...thank you! Would recommend to my friends. Used it for the first time yesterday and enjoyed how quick it smoothed my hair,5
"This flat iron is amazing!! The best I've owned in fact, better then my CHi, my Kpak reconstructor, my Paul Mitchell and my FHI. It leaves my hair with a silky, smooth finish that my other irons have not even come close to. Truly impressive, feels and looks like a healthy, soft new head of hair, my stylist doesn't even come close to the finished look that this gives. Amazing!!",5
I was using a chi iron but it was only 1/2 inch so I wanted to buy one that was a little bigger so that it would not take so long to do my hair. This iron is great! It is very easy to use and does a wonderful job.,4
"I purchased this flat iron after reading the reviews and deciding to part with a 10-year old, unweildy 3-inch iron. So glad I did! This iron is so much better than I thought any iron could be. It talkes no time to heat up, is easy to maneuver, and works great. I love that the switches are not on the handle right where you hold it, as they are on my curling iron. I have thick curly hair that is frizzy daily. This iron takes so much less time to straighten my hair than my last one and leaves it looking like it is naturally straight--definitely a professional grade tool. Great purchase at a great price!",5
This flat iron works really well! It heats up very fast and leaves hair smooth and straight! I would definitely recommend it! And the shipping was incredibly fast! It was here before the estimated arrival date! Thanks so much!,4
"This is a great product. My other - very expensive -  flat iron died. After reading the reviews for this, I decided to purchase it.  Not to mention it was being offered at a steep discount and had better overall product reviews.  This flat Iron  heats up fast  and is easy to use. The cord does not get tangled and the heat bars do a wonderful job of straighten my hair and/or  adding curls. I woud recommed the HSI 1' tourmaline to anyone who wants great looking and shiny hair. The seller is top notch, fast ship and the product arrived early. What more can I say - It was a win win!!!",5
"This is the BEST flat iron I have ever purchased.  I was so surprised when I received the flat iron as it came in a red carrying bag.  It was so much more than I expected for $44.00.  It has the quality of a professional in the features, look and feel.  I have never heard of HSI before but will purchase other items made by them due to the quality of the craftsmanship.  The adjustable heat controls, flexible cord and smooth plates.  My hair is shiny and this iron is so easy to use.",5
"I'm very pleased with this flat iron. Heats up QUICKLY. I have medium length hair with stubborn curls/waves and this iron works wonderfully on it. It doesn't seem to dry out and ""fry"" my hair like my old iron. My hair feels soft afterward.It was everything I expected after reading so many wonderful reviews. And at that price? You'd be crazy to buy anything else.",5
Heats up super fast and straightenes my naturally curly hair very well. Other straighteners that i have used will make my hair straight but still super frizzy. This one makes it feel silky smooth. After i read all the reviews i decided to go with this iron and i am very happy i did.,5
"Todava ella no lo puede creer. Rpido envi, excelente calidad y un precio sin competencia.La caja y todo lo que viene dentro de ella posee un acabado de lujo.",5
"I am very satisfied with the HSI ceramic hair straightener. It heats up in under a minute and glides through hair very smoothly. The only hiccup throughout the entire process was that the tracking system kept saying the straightener was in Miami even after it shipped (earlier than I expected). Overall, it's an excellent product and having gone through roughly 3 other straighteners, am absolutely enthralled by this one. Other reviews make mention of a gap formed by the straightener when clamped, I didn't see any evidence of this in my straightener, hopefully those customers had their minor defect resolved.",5
I love this flat iron as it is everything that it promised in the advertisement.  It was delivered promptly and it is beautifully packaged.  The product is very smooth on the hair and leaves the hair with a silky feel to it.  I have not tried the Argon oil yet as I wanted to try one thing at a time.  So I still am using my regular hair hair products with my new flat iron.  I find the flat iron very easy too handle and maniuplate on my hair.,5
I was reluctant to buy this product because of the huge discount.  I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived!  It works better than I had hoped!  I would recommend this to everybody looking for a flat iron!,5
I bought this iron when it was 44.00 and was  worried about the quality. I figured if I didnt like it I would return it. I am happy to say I will not be returning the iron any time soon. I love the iron. It heats up fast and handles my hair nicely. Even with out blowdrying my hair first it turns out great. This was a great buy,5
"I got this straightener for my daughter, who was coveting my very expensive straighter, thinking that she'd probably use it once and then go back to using mine. Wrong, she loves it! It's a great straightener at a great price...so glad she's finally leaving mine alone!",5
"I'm a novice to the hair straightening world, and I am very satisfied with the flat iron. It heats up very quickly and works well. I especially like that the heat is adjustable so I don't feel like I'm cooking my hair.",5
"I have a Chi and I couldn't help but grab a great bargin and try this out.  IT IS AMAZING!!  I literally feels like it softens my hair, it gives it a smoothness I haven't got with any other flat iron. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!",5
"This is the best flat iron i have ever used. I have thick, coarse, curly hair and most of the flat irons I have used have required the highest setting of heat to get my hair straight. The problem is that not only did it not get my hair totally straight but i had tons of damage and couldnt really afford to do it more than once a week. I set this on medium heat and it leaves my hair super smooth, this particular flat iron also comes with the argan oil which I put on before and makes my hair much easier to straighten. LOVE it and if mine ever breaks I will order the same one again.",5
"I thought about investing in a new hair straightener for awhile now as my old ceramic one never really cut it for me.  I have long, partly curly partly wavy hair and always found that it took way too long to actually straighten my hair to the point of it actually looking straight (and staying that way) and would only pull out the straightener for special occasions.  My sisters have always purchased CHI straighteners, but they were too expensive for my to justify (well over $100) and they have gone through multiple straighteners in the last few years.  After reading the reviews on this, I decided to try it since it was reasonably priced.  This straightener works fantastic!  I can fully straighten my hair in about 10 minutes and it maintains its smooth, silky straightness for the whole day!  It works much better than the CHI and I would highly recommend it.  Best hair straightener on the market!",5
My daughter and I are totally thrilled with this strsightener! It heats up fast and leaves our hair sleek and shiny.plus it has areally long chord that doesn't tangle. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality product for a great price!,5
"I love this item!!  It make my hair straight and smooth!!  It heats up quickly, and the red storage bag it perfect for travel!",5
Great product. I have coarse curly hair so it is hard to find straighteners that actually work on it. The straightener worked awesome. I put it on the high setting for my hair and it was great. It comes with a great little storage bag. Very pleased with the straightner.,5
"My daughter has very curly hair and it usually takes an hour to straighten it, with our new Tourmaline flat iron, straightening her hair was done in less than half the time. I like how quickly it heats up too.",5
Flat iron was all I hoped it would be. It heated up fast and quickly straightened my hair. The temp setting is great,4
The flat iron is AWESOME... I could not have asked for anything better. I love the heat setting and the storage bag. It heats quickly which is great for a busy mom.[...],5
This straightens my hair making it smooth and shiny. It doesn't smoke or burns the hair. My hair feels silky and doesn't get caught in the edges as my previous flat iron did. I would recommend this to everyone. You won't need a curling iron as this curls even better. Thanks.,5
I have tried other straightners bu this one works and keeps your hair shiny and straight all day!! I would recommend it to anyone.,5
"It worked like a dream for about 9 months, but then it just stopped working one day. I probably had it up too high for too long and overworked it.I have thick curly/frizzy hair, and it did wonders. I recommend this product, just be careful with the settings.",4
"I am so happy to find a great flat iron that doesn't cost $$$, but treats my hair the same!  LOVE LOVE this flat iron, took it traveling and used it at home as well and I couldn't be more happier.  Does not fry my hair like my last iron did, and is soooo easy to use especially with my shorter hair.",5
"This is my first flat iron. I had a gift card for amazon, so my price range was limited , but this transaction was great. I got my order quickly, and I have very straight hair. Great first iron, so far.",5
"I have been using this flat iron for about 1 month and so far I'm happy with it.  I've had two Chi's, one which stopped working after 10 months and the second around the year mark.  I'm not hard on them but I've heard this same complaint from friends that own Chi's.  Hopefully this is better.....fingers crossed.",4
"Have had it for 4 weeks. Works great no issues. Very good quality product. Even if it only works for a year people cannot complain about the price. Sure you might get a bad one but that happens in every product line market in the world. People that are not happy with this item maybe should have thought before buying such items on Amazon. Great Item, Great Value...... I recommend the purchase of this item 100%.....",5
"After reading about possible fake CHI Irons on the internet (she was wanting one), I showed her the reviews on the HSI 1, and she agreed to get it instead. She likes to use it, and the tourmaline plates are very smooth and parallel to each other. The heat control seems to work great, so in conclusion: Very happy with this product.",5
This flat iron is as good as the reviews claim. Heats up very quickly and does an excellent job on my hair. I have thick course hair and it just combs thru and straightens fast. Leaves your hair shiny and feeling healthy. The Free ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave in Treatment is incredible. Smells fantastic. The bag that comes with the iron is thick and seems made well. Very happy I researched before buying one at my local superstore.,5
I don't have much experience with flat irons because I have straight hair but my hair stylish suggest I get it to create a sleek look. I was going to buy a CHI flat iron but the HSI one got good reviews and had a good price. I've used it 2 or 3 times and it seems to heat up quickly. I love the argan oil that comes with it. It makes my hair soft and shiny.,5
"This iron is easy to operate and works quite well.  Like the adjustable heat setting.  Comes with a travel bag, too.",5
The straightener works incredibly well and heats up quickly. It also stays warm while you are using it--something other straighteners I've used have failed to do. I absolutely love the swivel cord as well. It arrived soon after ordering it and came in perfect condition. Great product for a great price!,5
"I don't typically review products.  I have had bad luck with hair products in particular.  Now that has changed.  This Tourmaline ionic flat iron leaves your hair looking and feeling like you went to the salon.  Believe me, I am a minimalist when it comes to styling my hair-if it doesn't work quickly and have noticable results, then I let it wilt in my product pile.  I read all the good reviews, liked the price and tried it.  I am very happy with my purchase- wish it wasn't bedtime so I could use it after my shower!  My only other comment is that I use this product with a professional grade hair dryer ( I use a Solano) - together the salon tools made my fine sometimes frizzy hair sleek and stylish with oh-so little effort.",5
I wasn't sure if this would work as well as the CHI but it is one of their products and I can tell you I'm not disappointed!  It works great and I get a lot of compliments.  Money well spent!,4
"This a great straightener, my old conair infinitely broke and i was in search a replacement. After reading a lot of the reviews, good and bad, i decided to give this one a shot. Having thick and heavy hair, it becomes a challenge for me to straighten my hair. This straightener did the trick. I even curled my hair, the curls were full of body, and bouncy, the best part they lasted. This is a great buy and would recommend it to everyone!",5
"LOVE IT!!! So happy, my hair got straightened so quickly, which is rare because I have really thick curly hair. There was almost no waiting time for the ceramics to heat up and it straightened my hair so much better than my old straightener.",5
I am new to hair straightening and but I have always heard about the CHI. I didn't really want to spend that much $ on something that I didn't know if I liked it. This is the economical way to do without sacrificing the quality. I use it with the Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray. My husband loves my new hair as well as my 6 year old son. I get compliments all the time about my hair on how shiny it is and how healthy it looks.It came with the oil and the glove so I don't burn my hand with hot hair.*****This is a must buy if you are considering a flat iron*****,5
"I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing and using this flat iron for the first time. I have never heard of the brand HSI (I was ready to purchase a Chi until I saw the price/reviews on this one), so I didn't know if it would be good or not. But I just used it for the first time yesterday and I got SO many compliments on my hair. It heats up relatively quickly, goes to very high temperatures (I didn't even have to go up to the highest temperature even though I always do!), and I straightened my very curly hair in TWENTY MINUTES. It took me an hour to do so with my old one! I also have a lot of hair and it's not short; when curly, it's a few inches below my shoulders. My hair is silky, very soft, and it STAYED STRAIGHT. With my old straighteners, it would always have waves in it by the end of the day but today, with second-day hair, it is STILL straight! Ridiculous. I love this product, and would definitely recommend it. Its value is much more than the price here.",5
"This hair straightener is great...I've had quite a few over the years and paid way more money, this is one of the best i've ever purchased, at a much more reasonable price.  Shipping was super quick, I highly reccomend.",5
The product arrived on time and was what my wife was looking for. She is happy with this flatten-er / straightener.,5
"This is the first professional flat iron I've used and I have to say that I'm really please with its quality and how well it works.  I have wavy/curly hair that frizzes in humidity, and the flat iron has done a really great job of straightening my hair.  Love it so far!",5
My girlfriend likes it better than her old chi that broke! It is thin enough to style but also provides great shine! Comes in a very professional packaging and looks like something bought for $100+! Great product and seems like it is built to last!,5
This item showed up on time and in great condition. It is by far the best hot iron I've ever owned- it heats up and cools off in less than a minute!,5
"Needed a new straightener. Most of the CHI's out in the marketplace today are cheaply made fake clones, there is no guarantee you are going to get a good one. I decided to try out the HSI. Great unit, good quality, every bit as good as a real CHI that I have used in the past. Buy this one and be happy.",5
"My package came immediately! It was great, the product worked perfectly when I tested it and not a single piece was missing. Overall 5 stars!",5
"I have purchased about 10 flat irons over the years and this is the best out of all of them. I only have to do one pass through and my hair is immediately silky straight with lots of body...in fact, it had a salon finish and looked like it was professionally done! Great buy!!",5
"I love my new flat iron. I like that I can set the temp. My daughter has thin fine hair and doesn't need as high a temp as I do, with much thicker hair. Also very quick heat up. Love the travel sleeve, comes in handy when I need to throw iron in travel bag right after finishing hair.",5
I have used a Paul Mitchell straightener for about 2 years-love it....but it finally died. I bought 2 others and had to take them back-they ripped and pulled my hair and just did not get hot. this one though is amazing! I have thick naturally curly hair and this straightener does the trick! It is very comfy to use and gets super hot-hair is shiny and sleek. I cannot say enough good things about it and the price was just unbeatable!!!,5
"I just received this flat iron the other day and wanted to try it out right away. I bought it after I had searched on the internet for the best priced iron with one of the highest ratings here on Amazon. I tried it and I am so pleased with the results! I love the sample of serum they added with it! I have very thick, wavy, and unmanageable hair, so I was a bit skeptical before buying this product. But I'm sure glad I spent the $45 for it. I haven't heard of this brand before, but I will continue buying any other hair products they sell.",5
I bought this flat iron for my daughter - Sh has long thick hair and this flat iron works great for her hair. She has had not issues and said it works better than her other iron.  I am very happy with the purchase and the price was fantastic compared to so many other flat irons out there.,4
"Great value for the price, straightens well, love that the on button is on the inside where it can't be accidentally shut off, I was always doing that with my other straightener. Heats up fast and stays hot!",5
"I had a CHI for 5 years, but it blew up when I tried to use it in Ireland. Not the CHI's fault. I couldn't afford to replace it so I began looking for other options. I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try. It works AMAZING! It is absolutely a steal. I have very thick wavy hair and most straighteners don't work well for it. This one does the trick. I hope it will last me 5 years like the CHI.",5
This is what I need to fix my hair.  It is easy to use and very light.  The result is a professional looking hair!  I love this flat iron.,5
I have used my HSI flat iron for 1 week now and it's amazing.  This works so much better than any store flat iron.  It now takes me 15-20 minutes less time to straigten my hair.,5
I was looking for a new straight iron after my chi broke.  I read several reviews about this brand and have been very pleased!!This is a great iron and I love that you can control the heat setting!,5
"So I got this flat iron based solely on the reviews its been getting (and maybe the price didn't hurt either lol) . And let me start by saying that I have owned well over 10 flat irons and I must say this is definitely one of the top ones. I love the fact that you can control the heat, the packaging was awesome and you can tell it was brand new, the fact that it came with a glove and oil was a bonus.",5
Bought this product based on reviews and for the price it did a terrific job. My hair is very kinky and this product made it very straight.  Received lots of complement on how my hair looked and it was very soft.,4
I am enjoying my new flat iron...it heats up really quickly!!!! The carrying case is an added bonus.  This was a great deal....,5
"I ordered this flat iron and was so happy when I received it so quickly.  I have had a chi in the past and it did not last a year.  I used this iron for the first time and love it.  It is easy to handle, heats up quickly and works better than the chi I had.  I would recommend it and an happy i ordered it.",5
This straightener was a great price for what I was looking for. It doesn't pull my hair like others that I have had. Works well for straightening and curling.,5
"I already have straight hair, so I didn't buy this to do heavy-duty straightening, just to keep things in check.  It does a perfect job for what I need, but I have certainly used better in the past. It heats up fast, you can adjust the temp, and the light turns green when it's ready. It's got a good clamp and does the job quickly, but you still need a product in your hair to make sure it stays straight. The cord is plenty long and the storage case is nice, the plug just doesn't fit inside.  Packaged nicely with a glove and sample though!",4
I ordered this product and am so glad that I did.  It heats up fast and does a wonderful job smoothing my hair.  There is a light indicator that lets you know when it is on.  The heat is adjustable to fit your type of hair.  The cord seems sturdy and swivels to avoid it getting twisted.  It does not pull my hair and easily glides over it.  I would recommend this product to anyone that doesn't want to spend a small fortune on their flat iron hair straightener but wants a good product.  Good value.,5
"If you are even considering purchasing this straightener, stop thinking about it and just do it! I thought I had a great straightener and was really upset when it broke, but this product is a million times better. It leaves my hair soft and naturally straight looking, not artificially pin straight or stiff. Best of all, it takes much less time than my old straightener. I feel like the price is really a bargain. Trust me, you won't regret it!",5
Flat iron works great and the price was perfect. I was surprised that the price was reduced from about $300 to $50.,5
"I was extremely pleased with my purchase. The price was fantastic and the delivery was on time. The flat iron is all I had hoped for. It heats up quickly. It straightens and flips with one stroke through my untamed mix of curls and wave. The handle stays cool. The cord is long enough to share the bathroom mirror while my 10-year-old brushes her teeth in front of me, yet it never tangles. I would highly recommend this product and this seller.",5
"I was very pleased with this flat iron. I can get my medium length hair sleek straight in about twenty minutes!The argan oil helps too. Now I actually look forward to straightening my hair... Very, very happy!!! :)",5
This is the best hair straightener i have ever had.Shipping was very fast.Highly recommended .It is light weight and heats up very fast.,5
"After reading reviews of this product, decided to give it a try.  I was amazed.  It is wonderful.  So much better than my Revlon.  Liked it so much I bought a second for my daughter for Christmas.",5
I bought this product after research for too many stores...I saw the same product at $200...great price and great results,5
My CHI broke and i didnt have the $ for a new one.Saw the reviews and ordered this one. Works just as good as my CHI and half the price. Great product.,5
"Gotta say, wonderful product for the price.  My wife says: ""I have been very happy with this.  I was a little concerned that it would not get hot enough, but that has not been an issue.  I haven't even been using it at full heat.""  Don't want to cook those little hairs!",5
"I love this flat iron! My hair is fine and a tad wavy and currently styled in an a-line bob. This iron is easy to use, straightens beautifully, doesn't leave my hair full of static. So happy with this product that I've just purchased my second one!",5
"then, really, it can get through anyone's! I have long, thick hair...and lots of it. I used a cheap straightener for a long time, mostly just for my bangs because it took FOREVER to do my whole head, and my arm was so tired by the end, it never even looked that great. I tried out my sister's straightener, which she paid over 100 dollars for, and there was a way obvious difference...I knew I needed to get a nice one of my own. I shopped around a lot and read a lot of reviews before I landed on this one...and I don't regret it at all. I was going to pay the 100+ if I really needed to, so for the price, this one is even more awesome. It took far less time to do my whole head, and my hair feels silky and soft. Don't over pay for a nice straightener...this one will get the job done!",5
Really love this flat iron. I think its better then they CHI I've used. I love that it comes with extras! Really happy about it.,5
"this is a terrific product at a great price. I am going to buy one for my daughter as well. didn't care for the red silk package and couldn't figure out what to do with the glove and flattening syrup, but that's okay",4
"Product works good, gets hot enough and doesn't take long at all. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a like product.",5
"Great flat iron - love that I can control the amount of heat so my hair never ""cooks"".  Very easy to use, quick to heat and my hair finishes smooth.  Easy to curl hair under or with a flip.",5
"I love this straightener.  I had an inexpensive model ($15) from a major retail store.  I did not know that compared to this one, it was junk.  About 2 years ago, I up-graded to a $30 model from a beauty supply store.  It was a little better, I thought, but,didn't have rounded, floating plates and left creases in my hair unless I turned it a certain way.  I bought this HSI model (a month ago) instead of the other popular model that starts with a ""C"", based on other reviews and price.  I must say for approx $50, this model is superb.  It does not crease my hair or leave lines. I have naturally wavy super fine hair.  It didn't come with a Biosilk sample but rather an HSI argan oil sample - which most of the time I forget to use.  It heats up in a flash and the travel pouch is super handy to put it in after each use.  My kids are in my bathroom a lot so the pouch is a major plus for me, I put it away each time, while it is still hot - so they don't burn themselves.  I would definitely recommend this product for someone not wanting to spend $100 on other models.  I don't think you will be disappointed.",5
I ordered this hair straightener from amazon and must say I am very pleased  with its performance.Received order in about three days after I placed order.This straightner gets nice and hot .I have curly hair and this does a terrific job. Would definately purchase again.,5
"My old flat iron would take forever to heat up. The HSI flat iron heats up very quickly. I'm still learning the settings as to how much heat I need since I've only had it a few days. The things I was looking for in a new flat iron was how long it took to heat up which I already mentioned that it heats up very quickly. I also wanted to know how smooth it left my hair which it does an excellent job. It also glides thru my hair very nicely. The outer part of the iron stays cool so you don't have to worry about burning yourself. All in all, I'm very pleased so far with my purchase.",4
"I have naturally curly hair so it can be difficult to straighten completely, this iron does a great job though. It heats up in less than 2 minutes which is very nice.",5
I am thoroughly impressed with the product.  I use it everyday and it straightens my hair very well.  I like the temp. settings and the tangle free cord.  Everyone should own one!,5
"I've had a few straighteners in my day and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I had my hair in a pony tail all day and this baby got the kink right out, first time! No more frying my hair to try and get it straight! Easy to use, comes with a nice glove in case you have sensitive hands and also comes with a nice cloth bag for storage. Long cord and very light! I also love how you can control the heat, no more on/off! I would recommend this to anyone who is frustrated with how expensive a good straightener is, what a great price!",5
"This flat iron is ok....I don't think it is better than chi, but it's great as a backup or to use for travel.  I use it at the highest setting, and it straightens my hair just fine without pulling.",4
I love this flat iron. It heats up really quickly! The adjustable heat is great and it didn't fry my hair.,5
"Shipping was quick! I anxiously awaited the straightener as mine was getting quickly outdated. I am more excited to dry and straighten my hair then I ever have been. Straightener is just as good, if not better, than the CHI my hair dresser uses. Absolutely worth the money!",5
Good product. Straightens well. Heats quickly and l love the swivel cord. Catches on the ends of my hair a bit but no too bad. Overall good purchase. Delivered quickly!,4
"I am definitely satisfied with the product. It heats up super quick, and straightens/curls my hair easily. I have thick, course hair and it works great. The only thing I don't like about it is that it does get hot in the area above the plates. But... They included a glove! It didn't even have that in the product description and it was in the box. The free sample was an HSI brand of argain (they spelled it that way) oil, not Biosilk, but I really don't mind that. The packaging was nice. It came with everything described and more. I would recommend this to anyone.",5
"HSI is a brand that I had never heard of.  I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this item, but I'm glad that I did buy it.With my other straightener my hair would get caught between the plate and the plastic.  I don't have that problem with this one.My hair is a bit wavy, fine and thick at the same time,and without much definition, with the HSI straigtener I get sleek, straight hair and with a little product, I have texture and definition.I would highly recommend getting a fresh hair cut first.  Dry, dead and split ends that are straightened are not pretty.This straightener heats up quick.  It comes with argan oil, which I don't use because my hair is fine and it absorbs the oil very quickly and makes it flat.  There is another product that I use, TIGI Bed Head After Party.  Makes your hair incredibly soft and silky.The only con about this straightener is that it does NOT have a auto off timer if left on for too long. Other then that, it does the job very well.",5
"It's basically a good tool with all the little touches included (heat resistant glove, storage pouch) but like another reviewer had said, there is no free bio silk sample included as described.  There is another sample product instead.  The iron heats up very quickly but it feels very heavy compared to others I've used in the past.  It's fine if you are using it to just straighten or pulling the iron downwards.  However, if you are using it to flip or curl, your wrist will get tired very fast.  It's better to use a traditional curling iron for that.  Overall, it's still a good product for the price.  I would recommend it.",4
Got this at a fantastic price and  am thrilled with the performance so far. My old straightener has nothing on this one. Highly recommended.,5
"I have used a Chi flat iron for the last 2 years and borrowed my friend's Remmington in the past.  The results do not compare to that of the HSI.  The HSI is wonderful for all hair types especially curly. My hair is a medium thickness and naturally curly. The HSI did a better and quicker job of straightening than the Chi. Plus as it heated up, it was easier to hold than the Chi throughout as a result of the grips and grooves that are all over the handle of the flat iron.  Additionally, the heat glove that is provided can be used if your hands are more sensitive.Overall, if you have curly or wavy hair, this is the straightener for you.  It heats up quicker, straightens faster, and is easier to hold/use because of the groove-design on the product itself.  I would highly recommend!",5
This is an awesome straightening iron.  It heats up fast and I love that you can adjust the temperature (something the Chi cannot do).  You can hold the ends without burning your fingers and the plates just slide through your hair.  My hair gets really straight and shiny everytime I use it.  I am so very happy I ordered this Straightener. I will be recommending it to everyone I know!,5
Amazing flat iron. Heats very quickly and straightens my hair perfectly (I have awkwardly wavy hair). The oil that was included for your hair also works extremely well to smooth and add shine. Highly recommend!,5
"This straightener is the best! I love it. It makes my coarse wavy hair smooth and soft. The glove is gigantic and the ""free biosilk sample"" is not biosilk at all. In fact it says ""argain oil"" but I am assuming they mean argan oil?Regardless, buy it! You will not be disappointed.",5
Purchased the item here at Amazon. Great product. Came with a storage bag for travel as well as a free sample of oil battle. Too early to tell how long it will last. Initially the quality looks very good and works like it should.,4
It's one of the better ceramic straighteners I've used.  I've gone through about half a dozen lower priced ones trying to find a good one and this is the best one I've used.  As good as the ones in the salons for $100+,5
"only used it once and im pretty happy with it... never used a flat iron so can't really compare it, but it met my expectations the first time time.",4
"Easy to use and handle, heats up quickly and works very well especially for the fantastic price.  Includes sample size Bio Silk treatment that really helps create an even smoother, straighter and silkier style.  A well made silken red cloth bag is included to encase the flat iron and everything comes in a glossy, study and gift ready box.",5
"I am very pleased with the quality of this iron. Works very well, has a longer cord than others ive used",5
"THIS IS A VERY SATISFACTORY FLAT IRON. I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THE ABILITY TO SET THE TEMPERATURE..IT SEEMS LESS DAMAGING TO THE HAIR..MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE WEIGHT..I FIND IT HEAVIER THAN MOST, BUT SAVING THE HAIR MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LONG RUN.",4
"I love this product!  It has a heat dial that allows temperature control.  It heats up quick and does a very noce job.  It was the perfect replacement for my old hair straightener (Which I had,had for 5 years!  I think I'll be keeping this one around for a while.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.",5
"I had my Chi Flat iron for 5+ years and it started to slowly go out on me. I was a bit skeptic about purchasing a brand I'd never heard of, so I reviewed (several times on different site) HSI compared to other brands before my initial purchase. The price was good and the reviews, even better. I received my item really quick, two days after I placed my order. It came in box with a nice red pouch! It didn't come with the free Bio Silk sample as stated, but I wasn't too bummed about that. Instead, came a small sample bottle of some HSI straightener solution. I'd immediately put it to the test and it worked really well! It heats really quickly and it does its job! I have only straightened my hair though, not curl it yet. I don't see why it wouldn't create nice curls. There is a light that changes from red to green and back again; I believe it's an indicator of some sort, but doesn't affect the hot iron. Overall, great quality, great product!",5
"This straightener works great.  I have no complaints about the product, but I did not receive the BioSilk sample like advertised.",5
Works just as it's advertised. Glad I didn't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a decent hair iron.,5
"This flat Iron heats up very quickly and makes my hair silky smooth! It is a great deal, and I will purchase another for a gift for Christmas!",5
I ordered this product for my daughter.  She did all the research and chose this flatiron.  She likes how quickly it heats up and how flat her hair stays once she's straightened it.  She would recommend this product to a friend.,5
This is the best product and a fabulous price.  It is truly the best flat iron I have ever used.  And it came with a fabric case as well as free bio silk sample.  I am beyond satisfied.  Shipping and delivery were speedy.  Thank you!,5
"This is the best flat iron, by far. I had another professional flat iron and it doesn't even compare with this one. This heats up extremely fast and stays hot. It takes very little time to striaghten my hair. LOVE it...huge time saver in the early morning. I would highly recommend this product. The price was amazing and it was here before the promised date. Great service from this company!",5
"This flat iron is a good product, heats up quickly, and stays hot. Easy to hold and I like the swivel cord, no more tangles.",5
Bought 2 of these straighteners hoping they were better than the Chi irons we previously owned and I was completely satisfied.  They are great and are much better!!,5
"I purchased this flat iron for my daughter's birthday.  What she loves...the floating plates, does not pull or catch her hair when she irons, keeps it smooth and not frizzy, heats well...she LOVES IT!  She recommends to anyone!",5
It heats up quickly and does a decent job straightening hair. It takes a long time to fully straighten hair though.,4
Ever since I have started using this iron people have been complementing on how well my hair looks. The iron really does a great job of straighting my hair. It looks smooth and shinny after ever use. My hair is not breaking anymore! Love it! A must have! As you get older your becomes more dry and dull. This iron makes my hair look fabulous!,5
"I was looking for a new straightener when I ran across this one.  After reading the reviews, I knew this was the one for me.  This is, hands down, the best straightener I've ever used!  I've tried several, and my most recent one before the beloved HSI, was a cheapy from good ol' Walmart, which left my hair full of static.  The HSI, however, leaves my hair so soft and shiny, with no static.  Plus, it straightens the first time.  It heats up super fast, so I can go from bed head to super sleek in 10 minutes flat.",5
This HSI professional hair straightener was as advertised and was a great value!  I also recieved it in a very timely manner.  My granddaughter is very pleased with it!,5
This is a great value!  Heats up fast! I would buy this same item again.. It is for my daughter and she uses it better then I do..WELL after 2 months of use the ceramic has become loose and the company WONT stand behind the item,5
"I just got my flat iron yesterday and oppened right away, my hair was a mess and let it heat to the max and to my surprise it worked like a charm, i have very thick, freezy hair after using irons from walmart and just wasting my money with them i decided to go for this one and coundt be hhappier ....if you are lookign for a professional iron and dont wanna expend a lot of money go for this one , is GREAT !!!",5
"I'm quite impressed with the value of this tourmaline flat iron. My order arrived before the estimated arrival(shipped to San Jose, CA) and included a flat iron, red satin pouch, glove, manual, and a 5ml bottle of HSI Argain oil. This is my 3rd flat iron and so far the best value. I blew my last iron while travelling abroad due to voltage difference. This is a decent product, it glides smoothly on my coarse Asian hair and the iron heats up quickly.",5
I love this flat iron.'d definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good hot iron that doesn't damage your hair. I liked the sample of oil received with the iron.Love it,4
"This flat iron is amazing! It was incredibly cheap and does salon-quality job. I have had 2 CHI irons before this and they worked well but died after a year or so, and cost $100+. This hair straightener was cheaper than the CHI and does 10x the job the CHI did. My hair is smooth and shiny and straight after using, and it does not fry it like many do. I would recommend this iron to any and everyone!!",5
"It says something in the instructions that there is some ""getting used to"" time involved with using this iron, but my wife said that this was not the case at all.  She pulled it out of the box, plugged it in and was done in a few minutes.  She's very happy with this purchase.",5
"This is my 3rd hair straightener in the last 2 years and by far this was the best product in terms of quality, value and effectiveness. I really like my hair super straight without feeling like I'm totally frying it. Other products I've used were either not straightening my hair or causing it to get too burnt and dry. I've been using the product for the past couple of weeks and it's far exceeded expecations especially when you take into account the price versus a Chi. My boyfriend, who sometimes doesn't even notice when I've cut my hair, actually made a comment about how nice my hair was after I used the HSI. That's good enough proof for me!",5
Great flat iron for the price. Heats up super fast and gives alot of shine. Truly a professional styler. Also comes with a nice carrying bag. Would recommend highly.,5
"Great product and even better deal! This hair straightener blows the Chi out of the water. I have super thick hair, but with one swipe with the TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON, my hair is straight and lays perfectly!You will LOVE it!!",5
I really love this flat iron. My hair looks healthy and shiny again. I also noticed it takes less time to straighten my hair compared with my previous flat iron.,5
"I have VERY curly frizzy hair, I bought this for my daughter, but I've ended up using it because I was curious to see if it would work for me since nothing else I've tried ever had. My hair came out like never before! It was so silky and smooth... We are very pleased with this product!! :)",5
I love love love this straightener! I will never ever ever buy another walmart straightener! Glides through my thick hair and leaves it shiny and smooth! It's amazing! I received it in less than 4 days and it came with a case! I recommend getting this one!,5
This flat iron is awesome - especially for the price! Heats up quickly and works super fast. I love it!,5
"I love this flat iron. I have biracial curly semi-coarse hair and for the past year have been growing out years worth of relaxers. I like to straighten my hair in the cooler, less humid months of the year so I need an iron that would straighten my hair and make it look like I have a relaxer without having to repress everyday. This does the trick. When I'm finished my hair is silky and shiny and holds the press perfectly. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good hot iron that doesn't damage your hair. I liked the sample of oil received with the iron, it smells great and a little goes a long way.",5
I like this flat iron because it has an adjustable heat control.  I have fine hair so being able to control the amount of heat is important.  As a bonus it comes with a nice travel bag and glove sample of Bio Silk treatment.,5
"I am new to using flat irons.  My first purchase was of a very inexpensive one.  I decided to try the HSI flat iron because of the reviews from other customers.  It performs much better than my current one.  Honestly, I need more practice with it to give an accurate review.  I will say that it heats  up quickly and rids my hair of ""frizziness"".  I feel sure that I will love it after learning to use it.  I think it is a great product for the price.",4
"I have been using the same chi straightener for 6 years now and when it broke I was terrified to try something new and worried that nothing would compare to the chi at the end of the day. However, I decided to take the risk and try a new brand and when I saw the amazing price of this HSI product as well as the other raving reviews people left I was sold. After receiving my new straightener I can safely say this is one of the best purchases I have ever made on amazon. It comes with a pouch and glove which I found adorable but, more importantly, the straightener leaves your hair smooth and works like magic without requiring you to go over strands multiple times. It doesn't leave hair looking fried or otherwise damaged and I'd even say I like it more than my chi.",5
"I like the flat iron. It works well. However, I have really thin hair so most flat irons work well for me. The only problem I have is the lack of automatic shut off. I thought all flat irons nowadays had that. I assumed mine did and left it on while I took a nap accidentally.TLDR: NO AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF, SO BE CAREFUL",4
I am so happy that I went ahead and purchased this product!! My hair is very thick and wavy and my previous straightener was not able to get all the bumps out! The HSI has been able to get my hair very straight and soft I love it!! .. And the price was a bonus!!!! :) I would definatley reccomend it!,5
"I have a super thick and course hair.  My salon gave me rave reviews about the HSI which sells for about $300.  I bought it on amazon for an awesome price.  I am satisified for the low price.  Would not have been happy to have paid $300.  Really, it works just as good as my 5 year old Chi.",4
My ceramic flatiron is better than I had hoped. I really like that the temperature is adjustable. My first flatiron did not have this feature and I felt that it was damaging to my hair. It seems to be very good quality and is beautifully packaged.,5
after much research i stumbled on the HSI it had nothing but good reviews so i decided to try it im so happy i decided to get it this is the best flat iron ever its way better then the one my hair dresser uses.,5
"This flat iron works really great, and if you have natural hair it works even better. Definitely worked out good for the price and I think it's the same or similar to what my hair stylist uses.",4
Before I bought the HSI flat iron I had spent soooo much money on different ones trying to find the PERFECT one.. All the other ones would fry the ends of my hair and leave them crunchy!!! Plus I have super thick naturally curly hair. I actually used the flat iron for the first time after going to bed with wet hair and literally only had to go over my hair once & not multiple times with the flat iron!  I finally convinced my husband to let me buy this one.. Simply because I was tired of spending more money trying to find the right one (I had 5 that just weren't what I wanted) I just KNEW this one would be perfect and it is!!! After I flat iron my hair it is smooth and NO fried ends!! I'm absolutely in LOVE with this flat iron & I recommend it to EVERY woman that has the same problem as I do! Plus the oil that I had recieved with it smells AMAZING leaves my hair so shiny & soft! Thank you HSI for the BEST FLAT IRON EVER!!!!,5
Love this straightener! Very happy with it. Came the day after I ordered it in a very nice box with a satin bag! I was pleasantly surprised :),5
"This product is amazing! I've always used Hot Tools or Chi, and I wasn't sure what to expect from HSI but this straightener is amazing. I have thick, curly hair, and it straightens beautifully. It keeps my hear shiny and smooth.  The price was amazing, the product was amazing, great packaging, incredibly prompt delivery. One of the best online purchases I've ever made, definitely found ""the"" straightener!",5
"This is my 2nd HSI.  I've never found a flat iron that works as well as the HSI products.  My hair is long, to my waiste and it looks so healthy and shiney since I've been using the HSI flat iron.  The last one got left at my boyfriends house in Oregon, so I needed another one, because I won't be seeing him again.",4
"I have been reviewing several flat irons once I had a chance to test one out in a mall.  They said it was a ceramic flat iron and therefore won't damage the hair.  I have hear of Chi before but they are super expensive.  The one at the mall (it was one of those kiosks/cart vendors) wanted $128 for it and I didn't recognize nor did I pay attention to the brand.  Therefore I went and searched for one that had lots of good reviews.  Chi was up there in price, but I don't do my hair on a regular basis therefore not about to pay that kind of price.  At the same time, I did not want to get a bad one and damage my hair the times I did use it.  Looking for a happy medium here.  That is when I found this one, HSI ceramic flat iron that sounded like it did it all, great price, great reviews.  So I tried it out and it was good.  It got hot real fast (turned it on while I brushed my teeth, when finished, it was hot hot hot) so not a big deal with waiting for it to turn on.  I started to go strand by strand and worked it well.  I need more practice with it, but once I get a handle on how to use it well, it should be a breeze.  Highly recommend using the glove so not to burn hands/fingers.  Overall for the price of this product, you cannot go wrong.",5
"I was looking to buy a new straightener because my old one suddenly quit working. I had a Conair Infiniti which I really liked. I had already been thinking about buying a ""professional"" model, but didn't want to pay the cost of a chi or a mall kiosk one. So I decided to give this one a try, you really can't beat the price. The good things about this straightener, besides the price, is that it doesn't pull or snag my hair. It does very little damage, and makes my hair look smooth, shiny, and healthy. The drawback, it doesn't get as hot as I would like. The control knob says it is supposed to get to 410 degrees at the highest setting, I don't think it is getting that hot. My hair is thick and wavy, and it does take twice as long to straighten my hair with this iron than it did with my old iron. I would say that I'm happy with it overall, though it may be better suited for someone with thinner hair. One more thing, if you order this item and need it in a hurry, don't choose the free shipping option because it will take at least a week to get it.",4
"Since this was my first flat iron purchase, I did some research before purchasing.  I am very happy with the quality and performance of this product.  Definitely worth it and it arrived earlier than promised. Great customer service!",5
"I am in love with my new HSI Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron!  It heats up quickly, only requires one ""swipe"" over my hair, and after using for about two weeks, it hasn't caused any drying or damage to my hair.  The HSI Argan oil sample is awesome, too!  I've been using it every day...not just on days when I plan to use the flat iron. My hair is soft and smooth, but not oily at all.  I had been looking at flat irons for several months (price checking, comparing, etc.), and I'm thrilled with the one I ultimately decided to purchase!",5
"I have used it once, very satisfied and easy to use and light weight.I do recommend this product and very good price too",5
I bought this thing for my daughter and she absolutely loves this product. My fiance has a Chi and she says it works much better. Great little gift idea. It comes with a red velvet bag for traveling and protection. We highly recommend this product. Works great!,5
"I recently cut my hair and love the way this flat iron lets me style it. I wish I'd invested in one years ago...I didn't know what I was missing! I've been using a large barrel curling iron to straighten my hair for years and this does it so much better. The heat control is fantastic, I can use just enough heat to get the job done without frying my hair. You gotta get one of these!",5
I love this flat iron!  It works great!  The day I received it in the mail it had been raining all day.  I had straightened my hair twice that day already with my old flat iron and so when this one came in I immediately tried it out.  It worked great!  I love how I can adjust the temperature...I couldn't do that on my old one.  I didn't have to straighten my hair the rest of the day!!,5
"I ordered my HSI on a Thursday afternoon and received it on Saturday. A friend recommended I get a CHI but the reviews were so good for this that I thought I would take a chance and try one. I have straightened my hair a couple of times so far with the HSI and it seems to work very well and my hair doesn't look or feel fried like it did with the cheap flat iron I was using.It even comes with a nice satin case.It was a nice change of pace to only have to go over each section one time to get it straight, especially since my hair is super thick and curly!",5
I love how it heats up super fast and I don't have to keep going over the same strands of hair over and over again. It looks great with just one swipe. Although it wasn't the bio silk serum it was an argain oil. Which is fine since I don't plan on using it. And it comes with a cute holder bag for the flat iron which is awesome and it also includes a glove so your fingers won't get burnt. How considerate!,5
Bought this product for my daughter-in-law who wanted it for her birthday.  She is very happy with it and has pretty long hair.  Would definitely recommend this product.,5
wife needed a hair straightner while on a trip to US. product is fantastic and price is great.Will buy again from Blue Novelties. It was a no hassle ecperience,5
"HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENERThis is my 3rd flat iron.  But this one the best of all, perfect for my hair, handy and easy to use, and very affordable. 'love it!",5
"Item came very quickly, works well on my shoulder-length hair for straightening and flipping.  Haven't tried to curl yet, as I am not quite that talented on my own hair! Like that the iron came with a heat-protective glove to wear on the hand that is handling the hair, makes it easier to handle the pieces while they are hot. Overall I like this iron very much.",5
As described . Straightens without damaging. My hair looks smoothe and it doesn' take too long to style. For the price- this is superior- no need to break the bank with designer names.,5
This is a great quality straightener for the price.  You cannot beat the value.  All the little extras were nice as well.,5
"The product is very comparable to the chi I bought a year ago. I think I liked the chi better, functionality wise, but it got fried, so I would prefer to spend much less money on a product that does the job just great(only complaint is that is smells strange when hot and doesn't heat up as fast as a chi). Otherwise, I love it!",4
"Nice presentation, able to adjust desired heat. Good quality product. Definitely recommend this product. Free bio silk sample included. Glove and storage in silk included as well.",4
"We received our product on time, and everything was as expected. We are very happy with our order and will order again in the future.",5
"I ordered this product on Amazon when my 4-year-old Chi began to lose its effectiveness on my thin, semi-wavy hair. I wasn't sure what to expect because I couldn't find that many reviews on the HSI straigtener (besides on Amazon) but I decided to try it out for the affordable price. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it -- good packaging, a sample of argan oil (which I love!), but most importantly, the straightener definitely lived up to my high expectations! I like that it has a temperature dial unlike the Chi so I can use the lower heat for everyday use (to minimize hair damage) and a higher temperature for days when I need perfect hair. It is definitely easy to use and I have no complaints whatsoever! It takes me only about 7-8 minutes so straighten my hair now so it saves me time in the morning too. It is a good buy and I would definitely recommend it!",5
This product performs exactly as I wanted. It heats up quickly and it is small so it works well on short hair.  It has a high enough temperature to work on my coarse thick hair.It came in a brand new box with a pouch and some oil.,5
This straightener heats up so quickly.  It is smooth and leaves hair perfectly straightened and curled at the end if desired.  I highly rcommend this product.,5
"This flat iron works amazing!It has great reviews, worth buying. Especially for this great price. My hair looks great, has great shine to it and loves how it curls. If you're looking for a great deal, this is it!.",5
"I just have to say that if you are looking for a straightener for your hair, this is the one to get. No joke! My hair was horrible, frizzy, and totally out of control. (I feel like I'm doing a commercial). After I used the straightener my hair was soft, sleek, and I actually looked like I had hair on my head and not a head full of disgrace. Seriously, I am so glad I read up on this product and bought it. Thanks a million... b/c my hair means EVERTHING to me.",5
I have had this flat iron for a month now and I love it! Great product! I recommend this product to everyone!,5
"Purchased on a whim, so glad I did. It has madea huge difference in the texture of my hair, itstraightens faster than my previous flat ironand straightens better then my old one as well.I am very happy with it and would recomend.",4
"I used to have a CHI Hair Straightener but lost it.  When I found this product online I was skeptical, because I had always thought the CHI was the best brand ""out there"".  To my happy surprise, I actually found this HSI 1"" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron for a great price and think it is the same if not even better than the CHI I used to have :-)",5
"This flat iron is awesome for the price.  I was looking at the CHI and FHI models but after reading the reviews on this iron I figured I would give it a try!  It works amazing, leaves my hair soft and smooth.  I have long hair and can usually flat iron my whole head in about 5 minutes!  Great product.",5
The product arrived as described. I have had no problems with the flat iron. The flat iron does a great job on my hair.,5
My friends have been trying to talk me into a fancy (non WALMART) flat iron for years.  I finally did it thanks to amazon and the reviews.  I'm glad I did.  I don't like fixing my hair for more than 10 minutes and now that is not an issue.  This is one great iron and it comes with a kool little red silk-quilted bag.  And my hair stays straight!I love it.Dana,5
very happy with it so far - have used it once but no pulling on hair and my hair is beautiful,5
"I was unsure after reading some of the mixed reviews. I was looking at the Herstyler that I saw at the mall which was 3-4 times more than the HSI. I absolutely love it! It leaves my hair straight, and super shiney. The pouch it comes with is a fantastic accessory.",5
"I had a HAI flat iron that finally went after 10 years, with the economy being the way it is I did not want to spend $130 on a flat iron, however, I very much wanted the quality of the $130 flat iron.  I found it in the HSI.  My only complaint is that it does not glide as smoothly across my hair as the HAI, but the result is the same!  I have thick wavy hair and this flat iron makes it soft, smooth and straight.  I love it and would definitely recommend it!!!!",5
"It doesn't pull my hair like my CHI iron did and it has a temperature setting. The price is nice, too!",4
"Before buying this product I read a few reviews about this product. Most of them were saying that the straightener worked well. Now I agree. It makes my hair shiny and straightness it pretty quickly. The handy pouch for this flat iron is great too. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look more attractive, shiny and manageable.",5
"We have been using the straightener for about a week, and it is working well.  We weren't sure, based on the price, but are very happy with the product so far.",5
"I've had a horrible year with my hair.  So much humidity.  I would see women with beautiful silky hair and be green with envy.  I asked my sister-in-law what she used and she suggested a professional flat iron, but to be very carerul not to damage my hair.I am thus far pleased with this flat iron.  Still practicing with it, but the results have been exactly what I expected.  Nice not to be a ball of frizz head any more.",5
I am very impressed with this flat iron.  The item shipped very fast and was packaged very nicely.  I am very impressed that it came with a storage bag and a glove to guard against the heat.  I also love the sample of Argan Oil.  The flat iron works very well.  It is nicer than my Paul Brown and Chi hair straighteners.  The price was unbeatable and I would highly recommend this product.,5
"I bought a $25 straightener in town and couldn't keep using it because it got too hot and didn't have a temperature control feature. It was actually burning the ends of my hair. So I turned to amazon to find a better alternative. The HSI straightener has temperature control (although it only shows the highest number on the dial, so you have to experiment with getting the right setting). The temperature control and on/off switch are inside the handle, which may seem inconvenient, but in reality, it keeps me from accidentally changing the setting during straightening. The unit heats up quickly and has an indicator light showing it has reached the right temperature. The HSI seems really well built so far and I'd highly recommend this model.",5
"Like most people that buy things, we all generally read feedback left by purchasers. I just received my package a few days ago and have been using my new flat iron everyday. So far I love it. It's really heats up fast. For the price... its a great investment.",5
"this is the best flat iron I've ever owned...similar to that of which my stylist uses on me.  heats quickly, doesn't pull hair and has numerous heat settings to choose from.  would definitely recommend.",5
"I really like using this hair straightener. It feels very smooth as it glides over my hair, and the results, even by a rather novice hair styler, are great. The design of the straightener is very nice, it is easy to hold and move about.I also like the adjustable temperature control. I use it at a middle of the range temperature for my hair and it holds the heat very well.Overall, I would totally recommend it, I have fine, fly-away hair and it makes it look so much better.",5
The Flat Iron & Bio Silk Sample is Awesome easy to use and comes with a nice pouch to store it in.,5
Works great. Lots of compliments on my hair since I've been using it. The case is very useful because I'm always on the go. The best part is that the cord is long enough and is on a swivel so it doesn't kink. Just ordered a second one as a gift for a friend.,5
"After reading the reviews for this flat iron, I figured I didn't have much to lose with it being on sale.  I must say that I am ultra impressed and agree that the HSI is at least as good as, if not better than Chi.  I love it!  I highly recommend purchasing the stand as it saves counter tops and creates that true professional feel. Thinking about ordering a second one.",5
"This product is awesome!  I have very wavy hair, borderline curly, and this flat iron makes makes me look like I have naturally stick straight hair.  My hair is very thick, but I am able to do each side with just 3 layers.  I get so many compliments on my new hair!",5
"Shiny, silky straight hair at last! I'd been holding out, trying to decide which flat iron to buy, and I decided on this one. The reviews all indicated this was the way to go and I can't agree more. I am so thrilled with my purchase. It arrive before I expected, as indicated with the oil to try. I love the multiple settings. It doesn't fry my hair, just helps create long straight shiny glass that I'd wanted. I haven't ever used another flat iron to compare but if you purchase this one you won't be disappointed. Yay! Thank you!",5
"First time owner of a flat iron so had no idea which one to choose.  Went by the reviews and they couldn't have been better for this brand.  Am still learning how to use the flat iron, but am very please with all aspects of it.  Would definitely recommend this brand for anyone looking for a quality flat iron.",5
Great product. My hair is shiny & silky. Other flat irons don 't leave my hsir feeling so good.well worth the money!,4
"Just purchased this hair straightener and really like the way it curls my hair! Yes, that's right, I bought the straightener because it claims it's for curling and flipping as well as straightening. I have another one (different make)that I use only for flattening my unruly hair, but can't use that one for curling because it is too large and flat. I have medium length hair that is medium in texture and thickness but has become a little bit wild with the years...(very curly grey hairs), so I saw this as a chance to change my hairdo up a bit. It heats very quickly and is easy to use. I like the way I can flip my hair up at the ends and wear a 60's style flip do. The curl seems to last for a couple of days and I can touch it up if I need to. Be careful of the tip ends of the straightener though; they are very hot if you don't put your fingers in the right place (hence, the 4 star rating). I suppose you could get a heat glove (they are also sold on Amazon)and I am thinking of doing just that. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It's a great product for the price!",4
"The HSI 1"" Ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron was all it was advertised to be. It heats quickly and stays at a constant temperature, no having to fiddle with the thermostat or wait for minutes for it to be ready to use. Hair styling is a snap and can be done in less than 3 minutes without damaging hair. It's a great product.",5
"Just upgraded from a Wet/Dry flat iron to this HSI and I LOVE IT!  My hair is very thick and naturally curly and it took no time at all.  I love the shine and the silky texture this iron produces, my hair never looked better.  It was shipped super fast and in perfect condition!",5
"My daughter was skeptical that this reasonably priced straightener would work well on her long, medium thickness hair. She uses it to straighten and make waves in her hair and is always pleased with the results.  We like it so much we are considering ordering another so we don't have to share.",4
It has been great for curling and straightening hair. Hair stays straight until washed when using a heat protective spray. Heats quickly.,5
"as a hairstylist, I know the good brands of irons. This one is a steal at the price, cheaper then we can even get it at the supply store. Great Flat iron! easy company to work with.",5
"I was very excited when my iron showed up on my doorstep a day before its earliest expectance, waiting for arrival is a huge part of the experience. i opened the box and found several neat gifts that came with the iron-a very nice and attractive silky protective pouch, a small bottle of argan oil to make my hair eve silkier, and others. the best part is that the iron itself is excellent quality. i love it, and ive had quite a few irons in the past. this is one by far my favorite.",5
"The HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron allows the user to select the heat intensity from a dial on the inside of the iron.  It also has a protective coating on the outside of the iron so the user does not burn their hands.  This is one of the best flat irons I have used.  The Chi, which is extremely expensive, can not compete with this HSI flat iron.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you are on a budget.",5
This is by far the best straightener I have ever owned. I would highly suggest getting his one over any of he others. I have tried four on Amazon and hey all quit working a few months later. Ths one is built better and so far performs just as good as the day I bought it.,5
I love this straightner... plain as that. I've used crappy drug store straightners and finally got something real. I love it so much. I love the grip and the heat and how smooth it makes my hair. Awesome straightner. :) Fast shipping too!,5
"I have straight fine hair and bought this to combat the frizzies/fly aways that I get with the summer humidity.  I'd only ever used a friends straightener which I used on High.  Stupidly, I tried the HSI on High the first time too and nearly fried my hair.  It gets HOT really quickly.  For me, a more medium heat works perfectly.  I am already able to curl my hair with it, flip it out, etc.  It is a great tool and was a great price.  I wish I could give 4.5 stars only because there is no auto off on this iron and I nearly melted my counter by leaving it on all day the first time I used it.  Otherwise it is awesome.",4
"This Tourmaline Flat Iron Straightener is great!  It heats up instantly and leaves your hair smooth like silk.  It is nice having a cord that rotates - such a nice feature.  Being able to select the temperature for your hair type is such an added bonus.  Purchased three, one for each daughter and one for myself.  Would definitely purchase again!",5
"I love this straightener!! Heats up super fast, minimal time to straighten, and makes super cute curls!! :) I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality product at a great price!",5
"I love this hair straightner. My hair is about halfway down my back. My HSI has my hair straight in less than ten minutes. I would highly recommend this product to everyone, especially since it works so well and is less than $50.",5
"so far this straightner is perfect, i have long hair wavy hair and it took less then 10 minutes to straighten my hair..my hair felt silky smooth...i would definitely recommend this to anyone especially for the price..",5
"This is honestly a fantastic straightener! Shipping was very quick, and I was excited to use it the moment it was delivered to my front door.The box was lovely; inside was the straightener in a red satin adorable case, a heat protectant glove, and a tiny bottle of argan oil. No bio silk sample, as said in many other reviews.I had upgraded from the $19 one I purchased at walmart... and looking on Amazon, it was between this and a Chi. I've used a friend's chi, worked well, but very hot. Other reviews said their's did not last very long. I thought about it, and finally decided on the HSI. Very happy I chose this! Excellent heat, not completely frying my hair, and my naturally wavy hair is perfectly straightened, and smooth and shiny afterwards.The drawback is that it does not glide through the hair as smoothly as the Chi, but that could be just me.I would recommend this to a friend. Great price, works amazingly. Love it!",5
"Buen producto pero la verdad es que la publicidad exagera un poco en cuanto a que no es un producto magico como lo presentan ya que al pasar por una vez la plancha no queda tan liso rapidamente como muestra el video, Yo me tarde 1 hora alisando el cabello de mi esposa y eso es un martirio, ya que la plancha esta muy caliente y el cabello caliente te quema la mano que no esta protegida con guante. Sin embargo mi esposa esta encantada con los resultados, y es logico ya que ella no hiso el trabajo. Asi que la recomiendo aunque como dije anteriormente NO HACE MAGIA!",4
"This item was just as described! I have been researching a number of flat irons, and I am extremely happy with my choice of the HSI. I also own a GHD and a Chi...this is extremely comparable to the GHD and works just as well if not better. And it's just a fraction of the price! I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly hair and this works wonders!",5
"This is an excellent product at an incredible price.  My only complaints are that the ""free Bio Silk Sample"" was actually a different product which had already been opened.  The broken seal on the bottle caused the styling product to leak out and leave a stain on the cloth carrying case that came with the iron.  This was a minor problem and should not dissuade the choice to purchase the iron.  It also included a glove to be worn when using the iron as it get quite hot and there is a burn risk.",5
I bought this due to the good reviews and was not dissappointed. I have never had any luck using a flat iron. I thought I was doing something wrong. Now I realize that I only needed a good quality product to produce the same look as my stylist at the salon!,5
I ordered this straightener without ever hearing of this brand and just by reading others reviews. Luckily for me this turned out to be an awesome product. I have naturally curly hair and it's very fragile from coloring and straightening it. This straightener worked on my hair in just 1 or 2 passes and it makes it so shiny. It heats up quickly and makes my busy mornings much easier because I don't have to take as long doing my hair. Fabulous straightener!,5
I purchased this flat iron through Amazon and received it in less than a week. This is an easy to handle flat iron that heats up quickly and does a great job straightening.,5
"I went online b/c I wanted a 1"" flat iron and was going to get a Chi, but I saw this deal.  I read the reviews and was like, why not give it a shot?  I love it!  I gets hot w/o burning your hand.  Unlike some of the negative reviews, I did not have a problem closing the plates over my hair at all.  The ceramic plates actually closed quite tightly over my hair and, as I've switched to titanium on my larger flat iron, it was an adjustment for curling.  I found that this was less of a problem for smaller strands.  However, the curl was really nice and held well.  I do not use a flat iron w/ an automatic shut off and, as somebody with long, thick curly hair (I use the flat iron to get a sleeker curl) I need a few minutes to straighten and I do not want a flat iron that I have to keep restarting, so the lack of that feature did not bother me at all.  My friend with waist length, curly hair (she owns about 5 flat irons) also used my flat iron when we were recently in Vegas and she also loved it.  She made some comment about it making your hair shiny.  She said she would expect it to be much more expensive and she plans on going online and looking for it.  The plan was for this to be my curling/ traveling/ back up flat iron (I have a bigger, more expensive one), but I could see it replacing my other flat iron.",5
"The HSI is truly amazing. You won't go wrong when you buy this product. I like it so much I am buying another one. One for my home and one to keep in my camper. It straightens your hair quickly and leaving it beautiful and shiny. I love, love, love this product...Thanks,C.S.",5
"I have been buying cheap flat irons for years and finally bit the bullet and bought one that has good reviews.  I have been using this flat iron for a week or so and I love it!  It heats up quickly and has a visible ready light.  The only problem I had with this flat iron is the temp control is situated in a spot that is hard to get to and read.  Other than that, it works like a dream!  The heat proof case is nice also for traveling.  I would recommend this flat iron for anyone looking for a professional quality flat iron, but not willing to pay professional prices!",5
The flat iron is great. The glove a great bonus as I have bad rashes on my hands so the heat does not hurt my hands.I am new at using a flat iron but this was easy to use and my hair looked great. I have curly hair and this worked great.,5
"I was very nervous about buying a new flat iron. I had a professional Fusion flat iron that a stylist friend of mine got me at cost & it made my hair look amazing! When it broke I wasn't sure what to buy because of all the options & costs. I assumed I would just get a Chi because I was so familiar with the brand, but did research anyway.This iron had great reviews & it sounded promising, but I had never heard of the brand before & that made me nervous. I sat on it for a couple of weeks & then I just decided to go with it & trust the reviews. I am so glad I did!! Once again my hair looks amazing! I have spent a lot of time swimming this year so I'm really looking forward to seeing the magic when my hair is healthy. Great product, would definately buy again & recommend it.  :)",5
"My daughter has long, thick blonde hair that will not straighten with the cheaper curling irons and has tried many.  I found the HSI on Amazon, ordered it along with the holder, it arrived in four days even with standard shipping.  I was afraid the iron would get too hot and melt her bleached hair.  We smoothed a bit of the oil sample that came with the iron on her hair and in five minutes she had beautiful, glossy, healthy hair. It was still straight the next morning too. Just amazing how well the iron worked with so little effort!  Also, the controls are on the inside of the handle so it won't turn off while using it.",5
i bought this flat iron just to have an extra one to keep at my office or for travel.  It works beautifully and you can easily adjust the temperature.  I have fine hair so I use at the lower temp.  Love the free sample of HSI Argan oil bottle included in my purchase.  Very pleased overall!,5
This flat iron is more than the seller claims. It does everything and more than those priced twice as much. If you want style without damage buy this item. Best on the market.,5
I have not used every flatiron like some reviewers BUT I've used enough to know what does and does not work. This works... plain and simple. I have thick wavy hair and this easily straightens it in one pass. And my hair stays straight through the day. For the price (I paid 45 with free shipping) there is not another iron on amazon that compares:),5
Love the HSI Straightner!! Recently purchased this product because I wanted to try something new and it has already replaced my many Chi straighteners and for a fraction of the price! Highly recommended!,5
"I purchased this as a gift for my g/f and she loves it! She came from and GVP flat iron that started to fail on her. The packaging and build quality of the HSI was surprising... so surprising that if I had hair I would have tried it out! ;-)Overall, this is a fail safe gift that the recipient will be more than happy to receive. BUY IT!",5
"This flat iron does an excellent job. I love the look and feel of it too. It came with a storage pouch for travel, which was a nice touch. The seller has also been amazing in terms of service, they followed up within days of receipt to make sure I was pleased with the product. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars...there does not appear to be an automatic shut off...not that I will ever leave it plugged in but it is just a nice back up. If it exists on the flat iron, it is not stated in the owner's guide. Otherwise, think this is an excellent flat iron for price and I looked at a lot of them ranging from ($50-$140). Very pleased with my purchase.",4
"I just bought this flat iron after owning three Chi irons.  So far, I think it is just as good as the Chi.",5
"This straightening iron is great! It heats up very quickly & smoothes my naturally wavy/frizzy hair with just one pass of the iron. It also comes with a protective heat-safe pouch & a glove to protect fingers.This easily compares in quality to my chi, however, it is waaay more affordable. Great product at a great price!",5
I love this flat iron!  It doesn't fry my hair and heats up really fast.  It also comes with a nice travel bag!,5
"I have owned many straighteners in the past but none have kept my hair in such good condition. After buying a cheap ISO for about 15 bucks, I had so many split ends and my hair was so dry. The HSI is the cheapest straightener that will still keep your hair healthy. I use mine just about every day!",5
"This flat iron feels solid, heats up quickly, really nice quality.  I was about ready to spend $175 at my hair salon for a GHD but figured I'd try this first and return it if I was unhappy.  It's an awesome flat iron.  I'll be interested to see how it holds up over time.  Comes with a heat resistant pouch.  Heats up ultra-fast.  I'm not knocking GHSD, from what I hear they're amazing, but this was less than a third of the price  plus I am worried about GHD knockoffs.  I had never heard of HSI (as far as I no they're not well-known) so no issue with knockoffs as opposed to the big names like CHI, GHD, etc. The results are fantastic and long-lasting on me.",5
I purchased this HSI iron and I absolutly love it! I have thick curly hair and I have used CHI and Paul michelle irons before but the price on this this one i thought i would give it a try. It only took me me 15 mins to strighten my hair and this iron did a wonderful job no snaging or frizz also does a great job curling under as I was straighting my hair in the end my hair was soooo soft and with a little pomade no fly aways this is a great choice if you are looking to purchase a new iron :),5
I had a flat iron that I hardly used because I didn't like it and didn't know how to use.  I went in for a haircut and my hairdresser used a flat iron on my hair and I really liked the look so I decided to get a better flat iron to try out.  After seeing other reviewer's comments I decided to get the HSI product.  I really like it.  It's a quality product that feels great on my hair and makes my hair look great.  I can quickly heat it and run it over my hair for a sleek look that looks like it could have been done at a salon. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone and at a great price too!!,5
I've used other flat iron hair straighteners but this one is the best i've used yet.  I've already told my family and friends about it.  It is a great product,5
"I did a lot of research on flat irons and am delighted with my choice. This iron is of light weight, heats quickly and extremely easy to use. I love the shine it leaves on my hair. It's a powerful iron and at the right price.",5
Great product - exactly as described.  First time I've purchased a flat iron hair straightener and this works great.  My hair is thick and it handles it nicely.,5
"Here is my daughter's review: ""Absolutely amazing! Works well every time! The Bio Silk also makes my hair really soft. I will definitely be buying more of that. However, I won't be buying a new straightener because this will last me a long time.""Straight from a teenager's mouth!",5
"I totally love this flat iron. I've used quite a few...FHI, Chi, and a bunch of other silly ones. This is by far the best of them all in my experience. I only needed one pass on the length of my hair to get my sections straight. I didnt need to go back over it 2 or 3 times. My hair is very smooth and silky straight with a lot of movement. I  didnt have any heat spots or get the sense my hair was burning like it normally does with others. I also loved the cute red bag I got and the HSI argan oil. I used the argan oil as my heat protectant...I'm not sure how pure it is or if its just a serum (does anyone know?). Either way it was a nice cherry on top. I looked all over google to see if I can get the bigger bottle. I'd be happy to get my hands on it! The swivel cord was just right, the length of the cord was just right. I love Tourmaline/Cermaic Technology and my hair does too as evidenced by the many compliments I got after getting this flat iron. My single problem is that the heat dial does not have more numbers. I'm not looking to fry my hair and I don't like guessing. It only has the highest and lowest temp settings. I'm not a fan of that. Other than that, good product.",5
I wanted the CHI but wasn't willing to shell out the $$$. This straightener works really well and the price is very reasonable. I have super curly hair and it cuts my straighting time in almost half.,5
"This iron is better than the Chi I used to have. I've had it for 3 months, use it every day, and am very happy with my purchase.",5
"I love this flat iron!!! I wish I could attached a picture so you can see the amazing job it does on my hair I have curly hair and it takes out all of the kinks once it gets really hot. One of my best purchases on Amazon!!! I got the package ontime and also a lil gift of oil..Little small lol but I will really try it this weekend when I wash my hair! I did a lot of research on buying a flat iron, for the price and product this was a steal!",5
"I love this flat iron.  I had the chi for many years when it stopped working.  The first time I used this flat iron, my hair was perfect - something I haven't seen since I had my hair styled professionally.  This iron is hot which I need for my thick, frizzy hair.  The Bio Silk sample was great.  I have been using the chi serum for a while, and it worked just as well without the strong smell.",5
"A very effective and well made flat iron.  Works on both my fine flyaway hair my mother's coarse wavy hair with beautiful results.  Heats up very quickly, has a lovely heft and balance when held in the hand.  Does not feel or look flimsy.  I can't believe I paid so little for an iron of this quality!",5
I think that this iron is better than the 3 chi flat irons I have owned.  I have been very happy with it.,5
"This flat iron gets really hot nice & fast so my thick, wavey hair is manageable after I use it. Either to curl or straighten, it's fast & easy!I love it!!!!",5
"Before i purchased this product all i knew about it was from reviews, never heard of the brand, yet i decided i might as well try it out. So glad i did, this is probably the best hair straightener i have ever owned. Heats up super fast and hot, and has a little light to tell you when its ready. Most straighteners take up to 30 minutes to straighten my whole head, this one completes it all in half the time. Even comes with a travel case and a bottle of heat protection. Probably the best thing to get on amazon.",5
"My sister has this flat iron and I used hers a few times and fell in love with it, so I had to buy my own. This is the best flat iron I've ever owned and it works great on my hair.",5
"My flat iron mysteriously died so I needed to make a decision and buy a new one fast. I knew I wanted and ionic and I also knew it would be expensive. I was surprised to find one that looked exactly like what I wanted for such a good price; I figured even if I wasn't happy , no big deal. Well I actually am very happy! This flat iron came in a beautiful satin bag with a heat protective glove and a sample of argan oil. The bag is pretty and keeps everything in order when it isn't in use. The oil is silky and makes your hair shiny but doesn't weight it down at all. And the glove is useful especially of you need to lead the hair section around the closed shell of the iron with your other hand for waves and curls. As for how the iron works, I love it. It doesn't fry my long, fine, wavy, processed hair, so I know it will be great on others! I really lucked out. I would definitely recommend this iron; it was an excellent purchase and the seller was also kind and professional.",5
"I love this flat iron! It is easy to use, has a wide range of heat settings, a swivel cord, and is light weight which helps in doing flips and curls. I highly recommend it!",5
"I bought this flat iron to replace a CHI, that broke.  I have to say, I was a devoted CHI user, but after using the HSI a couple of times, I have a found a new favorite.  I have gotten several comments on how great my hair looks, and I have noticed that even on the second day after I flat iron, I need to run over my hair again just minimally.  I love that it has a temperature control.  I received a sample of Argon oil, instead of the Biosilk, but since it was a free sample, that was fine with me.  I also had a glove included in the box.  I'm guessing it is a heat protection glove, but I couldn't find anything about it in the paperwork that came with the iron.  I have not needed to use it, as the flat iron does a great job of keeping the heat on the plates.  I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone looking for a great flat iron at a wonderful price.",5
I have really thick hair and this works great for me. I also wear my hair in a ponytail often and this gets rid of the bump from that. The indicator light is great so you know the iron is hot enough before you start straightening. Great price for a great value.,4
I have very fine hair and was worried this iron would damage my hair.  It has adjustable heat settings which was perfect to make sure my hair didn't get too hot.  It's easy to manipulate through the hair and smooths it quickly. Love the bio silk sample that came with it too!,4
"I love my HSI Flat Iron. I have curly thick hair and always spend a longtime to get it nice and straight without the dried out look. I had a Chi before the HSI, and the HSI works 100 times better than the Chi!! My Hair is always smooth and Silky when I'm finished using! Not only does the HSI make my hair look and feel great it came with a travel case and a heat glove so I wont burn my hand! I love this and anyone looking to spend less money for a good product this is the one!",5
"Wonderful flat iron! Works perfectly for myself and my daughters who agree with me this is better than the CHI straighteners we had previously. My daughters have thick hair and I have curly hair and all of us get a soft, straight, silky result after using the HSI. Highly recommend!",5
"Great product for such a good price. Used to use a very base model of straightener, wow, didn't realize what I was missing. I live in a humid state and it still stays straight. I also have a meannatural wave and it keeps it all in line. I would highly suggest. :)",4
"Flat iron works very well, and the price is great too.  My friend bought three of them, for herself and her daughters. The flat irons are great quality.",5
"My dad bought me this flat iron after a long time of deciding on which new one to get. We didn't want to spend this much but its so worth it! It replaced my 1 1/2 inch conair infiniti. That one stopped heating up randomly. Anyway, this one heats up fast, like under 30 seconds, the heat is consistent, HOT, and its easy to squeeze. I like the little red bag it came with, although I don't think the bag is heat-proof. Over all, great flat iron! The only thing is, you can't see exactly what tempreature it is because it has a dial instead of a digital display. That doesn't bother me or affect how well the iron works so it's fine.",4
I bought this for my daughter since her salon-purchased one ($110 - at cost 2 years old) had just quit.  This is one of the best deals EVER off of Amazon.  Her hair NEVER hangs up or snags on it.  It has worked perfectly since purchased.,5
Great flat iron! Great price! Heats up fast and does it's job! Worth more than I paid. Shipped faster than estimated date. I give this iron 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!,5
It arrived sooner than I expected.  I used it before I went to my cousin's wedding. Everyone thought that I did my hair in the hair salon because the result was terrific.  I loved it because it was easy to use.  I totally recommend it to my friends.,5
"I just used my straightener and I LOVE it!!!It straightened my hair perfect, heated up quickly and stayed hot. So simple to use, and actually straightened my hair a lot faster then my old hair straightener.",5
"Really like the straightener. Gets very hot, very fast and doesn't pull on my hair. I miss my old flat iron, but this one has been a great replacement!",4
"Very good flat iron. I have long, thick, naturally curly hair so I can't use cheap flat irons. This one works great. My hair doesn't end up frizzy or only partially straight. Price is good too.",5
"My wife's CHI broke a couple of months ago. The on/off button itself came apart. I opened it up and found out the switch was built into the greenboard, so I wasn't able to fix it myself. Insetad, I read the other reviews and opted to get her this flat iron as a replacement. She's been using it for about 5 weeks now. It took some getting used to and adjusting to find the right temperature for her hair, but after repeated questioning to assure myself that I made the right choice, she has affirmed that It works just as well as the CHI. The style is very nice, the item has some heft to it and I don't think it is poorly built. Overall, I think it is a solid investment and I know she's enjoying it. I have heard zero complaints and she uses it daily.",5
This iron took me about 5-10 tries before I really liked it.  I think it does not run through the hair as smooth until it's been used a few times.  I am still undecided if I like this HSI more than the CHI original flat iron.  It was a good buy and does work really well.,4
"I got this product a few days ago and the packaging was awesome, it felt like christmas when It arrived at my house. I plugged it in and in like 15 seconds it got completly hot, The box the straightner came in included a random glove. It arrived quickly also, quicker than stated so I was very pleased! :)",5
"I wanted a chi, but found this on a great deal on amazon. I got it and have been pleased with it. It does get very hot very quickly. I do have to run it over the same spot a few times before it's all flat, but it' probably due to my hair. I have it set on a higher heat level and love that you can adjust it easily and it heats quickly.",4
This is a good straightener if you want something temporary. I mean I started straightening my hair one day and the the top plate totally came off and burned the tip of my finger! (Thank God it didn't catch my entire hand) I kept it in a secure place even kept it in the original box. Please save your fingers/hands,1
Because it pulls your hair out when you use it. The side of the irons are not flat enough and it causes damage to your hair by ripping it out.,1
the plates do not get as hot as the advertisement claims.  cools down quickly as i'm straightening my hair.  does not stay hot.,1
I had an expensive model for quite a while that broke. This got good reviews so I thought I'd try it. My old iron left my hair smooth and shiny. This doesn't go through my hair as smoothly and does NOT make my hair shiny and soft.,2
"It's about as good as a grocery store flat iron. Compared to my stepdaughter's Babybliss, this does not cut the mustard, or straighten the locks. They sent me another HSI, in case something was wrong with the first HSI. Same exact performance--sub par. I have thick, coarse, frizzy, colored hair, so I need a good flat iron.",1
"Bought this item and was defective, hair kept getting caught in a gap on one side. Returned it and bought a Solia instead and I love it! Had to continue using the HSI over and over vs the Solia which left my hair straight for days! I owned a Chi before but broke within two years, bought another and the same thing happened. Buying another Solia for my daughter!",1
"I was a faithful CHI customer for 10 years.  After I had 3 CHI flat irons fizzle out in the period of one year, I was over that brand.  I read reviews for this flat iron and I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!! The quality is equal to, if not far superior, to that of a CHI.  I was also impressed with the packaging (received a glove, argon sample, and a carrying case).  My hair is silkier and I am able to straighten my hair in record timing.  I also like the heating feature of the iron so I could play with the temperature setting.  I have fine hair and this iron is perfect.  Buy it, you won't regret it.",5
Was highly disappointed with this flat iron. I purchased this because of the great reviews it got and was trying to save some money but not purchasing one of the more expensive products on the market. Big mistake!  All this flat iron did the entire time I used it was pull at my hair. It was painful. So grateful that Amazon makes returns soooo easy.,2
"I've use this flat iron only three times so far, but I love it!  My hair is straight, silky and shiny, without the burnt smell that my last flat iron was leaving.",5
"I found this straighter due to the outstanding reviews of my fellow amazon reviewers.  I had to see what all the hype was about. I've been using this straightener for about a month and I love it.  Doesn't damage hair and works very fast and efficiently.  Replace your old, outdated straighter with this and you will not be disappointed.",5
"This is a nice flat iron.  I am a natural blonde with mid-back length fine hair, but have recently made the change to coloring it red.  Any heat styling can cause the red pigment to fade faster, so I'm glad this iron flattens hair the first time.  I only need to go over it once!  It heats up fast and goes from low to over 400 very quickly.  With other irons that I had purchased from department stores, I was using the high setting, but I did not need to with this one. The iron has a good weight, not too heavy and not too light.  The plates are super smooth, and I haven't had any pulling or catching of hairs.  The plates also have a little spring to them so when you squeeze the hair it puts the right amount of pressure on it.  The 1 inch width is perfect for me, wide enough to do my hair quickly, but not so wide that I couldn't do my bangs easily too.It has a decently long cord that swivels to prevent tangles which is nice.  I would give it 5 stars except for the new safety fuse box added to the plug (test/reset buttons).  This makes it difficult to plug in a hairdryer and irons at the same time unless you have multiple electrical outlets or an adapter for adding a plug.  I also don't need the satin case that comes with it, but some people might like it.  For the $39.99 I paid, this iron blows others completely out of the water.  Great value for that price!!",4
"I purchased the flat iron August 1 of this year.  It then started having issues (not heating up) in October, and too late to return it back to Amazon.  I contacted the manufacturer two different times, the later part of October and the first part of November.  A message came up saying they would respond back within 48 hours.  Never was able to fall back on the manufacturers warranty after 2 1/2 months of use.  DO NOT BUY FROM HSI AS THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.  I have had other brands of flat irons and have never had one die as soon as this one did.",1
Received this for a birthday gift as I am trying to grow my hair out It heats up very quickly and only takes me a few minutes and my hair is done! I don't like to spend a lot of time on getting ready in the morning as I have to be out the door by 530 so this a great product for me,5
"I was skeptical about ordering a product that I had not heard a lot about. I last owned a CHI that I used for 2 years and paid 130.00. I recently cracked the electrical box unit that plugs in to the wall. I bought one at a mall kiosk a couple of weeks ago, brand name ""Royale"", was as good as my Chi, but 2nd time I used did not heat at all. I sent back and they will be sending me a new one, however I thought I would get a less expensive back up meanwhile til it came in. I found your flat iron  ""HSI "" on Amazon and read a lot of good ratings, so I ordered.  After receiving it is by far better quality than either my Chi or the Royale, and works on my hair as good or better than my previous irons.....not to mention the value was fantastic! I would recommend this product to anyone and the satin case it came in will make it great for traveling as well! HSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE HEAT CASE & GLOVE. DUAL VOLTAGE 110/220V.",5
I have never used a flat iron before and this was easy to use and really made my hair look great.  I really loved the Argan oil that came with it - made my hair really soft and shiny.  Easy to use instructions and great to have the glove so that you don't burn yourself.  I would recommend this product.,5
Great price fast delivery. Excellent straightener. I recommend  this hair tool for women with hard to straighten hair.  It heats up quickly and feels like a well crated tool.,5
"I have EXTREMELY curly hair. They're bouncy and everywhere. Recently, I got a hair cut. And sadly, this stylist cut my hair TOO short. It looked terrible. So I tried straightening it. It looks beautiful this way. However, I didn't have a straightener of my own. So being an online shopper I decided to buy one off amazon. I've had it for a few weeks now, and I love it. I use it at least 3 times a week, and it gives the same awesome performance, every time. I look forward to continuously using it.",5
"I love this item.  I was skeptical about ordering this item, and meant to save it to my wish list.  I accidently clicked purchase by 1-click through Amazon.  I am so happy that I did so.  For the price, this beats my Chi!K",5
"I was a bit skeptical about buying this product, as I have always been a chi owner/user. I must say that this product exceeded my expectations! My only complaint is that is is a bit more weighty than the chi, but definitely works as well for nearly half the cost. Will purchase this product again, and highly recommend it!",5
"I am very please with the quality of this product. It seems not only very durable, but it is also not an ugly appliance on my vanity. It works wonderfully on both my fine and slightly curly hair and my daughter's very long and very curly hair. The glove that comes with it is a necessary and useful addition especially for straightening someone else's hair. I could not ask for more from this product.",5
Does a great job straightening my hair. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I was also impressed with the storage pouch that came with my hair straightener.,5
First time buyer of a flat iron and I couldn't be happier.  Adjustable temperature control ensures you get the amount of heat right for your hair.  Easy to operate and comes with a sample of HSI Argan oil that is excellent!  Highly recommend if you are in the market for a flat iron.,5
"This is the best flat iron I've ever used, makes my hair nice and silky... I'm African American and have really long hair, I also have two daughters with long hair and this iron did the wonders for us. I will be ordering two more for my girls, because they love it so much. Great product at a great price!!",5
this flat iron is very sturdy and gets very hot! I think this flat iron works better that the Chi i have been using. The price is great! My only suggestion is that they install an auto shut off timer.,5
This is a great product.  Almost like the ones they use at a salon.  My daughter likes me to use it on her because it is cool to the touch and won't burn her ears.,4
"really cannot believe this flat iron is only $39.99. It is worth every penny. I have used other flat irons, the INSTYLER, and brushes to get my hair straight. This works better than anything I have used-PERIOD.I have below the shoulder, wavy, frizzy, thick hair. I have a lot of hair. I can flatten my hair in 5-10 minutes with this and it stays straight for 2-3 days.Would not hesitate to buy again or tell my friends This is the One.",5
"This flat iron works so quickly and is far better than the GoldenHot one I paid twice as much for. Well worth the money. They also included a free sample of their argan oil, which I prefer to my usual brand from my salon.",5
"After researching irons and reading reviews, I ordered the HSI Ceramic Flat Iron.I previously used a Chi and was happy with it for many years. I was hoping the HSI would work just as well. To my surprise, the HSI iron exceeded my expectations. It is a superior product. It feels great in my hand, heats quickly, and straightens my course, curly hair with ease. The packaging was great, and the glove and oil was a surprise gift. I checked the iron out with my Paul Mitchell stylist/educator, and he concurred - HSI makes a great iron. To top it off, the price/value was fantastic. Amazon came through again - value, quality and free shipping. I highly recommend this flat iron - you will not be disappointed.",5
"I received this product in a timely manner and was excited to test it out.  I had gone through all the reviews and thought this would be an excellent addition to my hair care routine.  I already have the CHI and the Wet-n-wild from wet 2 straight and so I hoped that this would be a lot better.  When I used it it was no better than those that I already had.  My hair being that it is extremely curly, I was not satisfied to with this product at all.  It did nothing spectacular with my hair and it took so long for me to get it to a reasonable straight. I guess I set my expectations too high for this product because it didn't even curl the way I had expected.  Although it came with a small bottle of argan oil and a safety glove, this product did not help me the way I had anticipated.  Maybe this iron is for straight or wavy hair.",1
"I didn't expect anything amazing for the price, but the temperature settings don't even appear to work, which is annoying.  Pretty sure the green light is almost never accurate, and sometimes the light will randomly switch back to red while you're straightening.  I have super-long hair and I get paranoid about frying it, so I like to find the perfect temperature and stick with it....tough to do with this straightener.  The plates also catch a little : (",2
"I wish I could have liked this but honestly I've had better straighteners.... My hair does not stay straight with this. I went out and by a few hours later my hair was a total mess, no longer sleek and smooth. It hurts a little to hold it, it feels kinda cheap when I clamp it. There's like this little squeak. Just invest in a GHD from sephora, it's much better and worth your money.",2
"I have had many straighteners in my years and I have invested a lot of money throughout the years.  I received this product last week and so far it has proven to be average.  It does it's job, but not up to my standards.  I was hoping for more, but can't complain too much.",3
"During a recent visit, my sister convinced me that I needed a flat iron.  I've heard a lot about the Chi, but I still had visions in my head of the horrible flat irons of the 90s that somehow managed to pull, burn, and tangle your hair simultaneously.  My sister had a Chi and let me borrow it and I was amazed at how well it straightened my curly hair.However.  The price?  It's a little beyond my budget.  So, I turned to Amazon to try and figure out if there was something comparable that wouldn't flatten my wallet as well as my bangs.Based on the reviews, I chose the Hsi.  And I am very happy that I did.  It performs just as well as my sister's Chi, but at half the cost (maybe less!).  I use it almost at the highest temperature setting and it only takes a minute to heat up completely.  It's nice that it has an indicator light to let you know when it's ready to go.The plates are great.  They don't pull at all and glide smoothly over my hair, even when it's a frizzy mess.  It takes no time at all to get everything smooth and looking nice.The straightener comes with a small bottle of Argan oil, which smells nice and smooths on nicer.  There's also a glove that you can use on the hand holding the hair to keep your fingers from getting burned.  That's a nice touch.  A red satin bag is also included for the straightener.All in all, I'm very happy with the Hsi and I'm glad I purchased it.  My hair is too.  And my husband.",5
"To illuminate as to my hair and its needs, I am South Asian and have very thick hair. And there is a lot of it.My hair texture tends towards dry and coarse, and on flatirons with temperature control, I keep the dial turned up to high.I had a CHI flat iron prior to this iron, and after reading the reviews, I think my expectations for the HSI were too high.  I think this iron would be great for someone with normal to fine hair. The HSI does the job, but for smoothness and ease of use, I still prefer CHI.  Price-wise, this iron is a great deal, and it definately does straighten- or curl- my hair well enough, but to compare with CHI, I have more flyaways and a ""drier"" texture to my hair. (This after using the iron with the CHI silk infusion, which by the way, is a great product!)",3
"I bought this product to replace a chi that I had for several years. This straightener is ok and does straighten hair, but I do not consider it the ""best"" on the market. I do not like the way it feels on my hair and I do not think that it makes my hair look or feel soft. I will shop around and I will pay more to replace it with something more appropriate for my hair and style.",3
It takes ages to heat and does not maintain the heat. Ive used other straighteners that leave you perfect in 2 minutes. This is not one of them.,2
"The HSI flat iron is the best!  I used to hate  straightening my hair everyday because it took 30 minutes to straighten all of my hair, but now that my HSI was mailed to me I enjoy styling my hair!  My hair is left VERY soft and silky and the flat iron glides across my hair and never pulls it.  Now that I have my HSI, it takes way less time, AND my hair is soft and straight.  I  HIGHLY recommend  the HSI and I hope that you will be able to experience how great it is.  (at a very low price also)",5
"I am very pleased with the quality and performance of my HSI Ceramic flat iron. It heats quickly and straightens the hair without pulling or frying it. I have fine hair, but like the straight look and this flat iron does a great job. I also like the swivel cord feature and the feel and weight of the iron. Excellent product and great price!",5
"i LOVE this straightner. This is the first HSI that i have ever owned. Normally i only will buy Chi's, because they are the only one that i have found to work with my hair, which is naturally thick and curly. But i decided to give the HSI a try as i have heard of them before, but didnt know anyone with one. Well i happen to need one ASAP, and seen this one for a WONDERFUL price so i went ahead and bought it. I now LOVE it more then my CHI....=) The Shipping was fast and was shipped out the next day after my order was placed, and i placed my order at 830 at night! This does not put your hair, or make it frizzy like most other ones! I will definatly be buying another one soon for a backup!! =)",5
"I totally love this flat iron!  I had a Chi that quit working in less than a year, so I replaced it with this iron.  Not only is it better, but cheaper by leaps and bounds - I picked it up when it was $49.99.  It's a great product at a reasonable price.  Cant beat that...",5
This was a holiday gift for my daughter. so far so good !works great.... fast delivery. GREAT price.thank you !,5
"I thought I'd ignore the reviews. Big mistake. The item doesn't heat up to the stated heat. When I'm done, it looks like I haven't even used it on my thick hair. Plus, the green light that says it's ready switches to red every time I open it. Definitely not worth the price. So sorry I wasted my time and money.",1
"Having been blessed/cursed with wavy hair all my life this isn't my first flat iron but this will definitely be the last time I buy an HSI product. I was looking to replace my faithful Solia flat iron that I have had for 5 years and which in the last few months had been needing higher temps on it to get the desired result (385F). Looking at the great reviews on this flat iron and considerably lower price I decided to go with HSI. I just got it in the mail today and decided to try it. My true test of a flat iron is how quickly it is able to flatten out my hair when its dry and give a great finish, however since I had washed my hair i decided to go the more traditional route of using it on towel and blow dryer dried  but still moist hair (usually the best results and the quickest). I turned it to 385 F (an estimation since the dial has only two reference point 140F and 400F) let it heat up until the indicator turned green and started using it. By the time my hand had started cramping 5 minutes later i had only done the front 2 inches of my shoulder length hair. I switched over to my Solia which did the rest of my hair as easily as it always has and am returning this one immediately. This is the fastest I have EVER returned anything on Amazon. So don't waste your time and money because what you save on money for the iron you'll shell out in buying wrist splints and Ibuprofen for the cramping",1
"i got this for my wife and she said it wasnt getting hot enough to do anything so i asked for a replacement one which they sent right away, but it was the same. now were having problems getting a refund for it when it was sent back to them over a month ago.",1
"When I recieved this hair straightner I was really excited. It came and was exactly how described by the seller. I used it two times and it worked great! However, on my third use I was using the straightner and it was not working as it had the previous two times. Turns out one side of the hot plates was not working at all. Do not buy, it is a waste of time and money!",1
"The item that I got was a defective. After I leave it on for the highest degree setting, it only heated up a little above room temperature. I could even touch the iron with my hand and didn't feel too hot to touch.Returned the item and I am waiting for refund.Trusted on the high review ratings...but I guess I am the only unfortunate one??!!",1
IT'S AWESOME ! I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR AS MUCH AS IT DID BECAUSE I'M AFRICAN AMERICAN BUT IT DEFINITELY PROVED ME WRONG IT MADE MY HAIR SOO SUPER STRAIGHT . I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE OF ALL RACES !!,5
"I really loved this straightener. Functionally, it worked perfectly. My hair is thick and wavy, yet this straightener always made it smooth and straight. But now it's broken.I've had it since the end of September and today it stopped working out of nowhere. It was working fine just a couple days ago. I didn't do anything to it. And yes, the outlets are working and I've hit the reset button about a dozen times. Ugh!Really wish it would lasted at least a year! C'mon!",2
"This is a great professional grade flat iron for a great price.  I just started using this a week ago an have been very happy.  It straightens my hair and I can use it to curl the ends if I don't want it stick straight.  It heats up very quickly and has a little light on the side that starts as red and turns to green when it's ready.  There is a heat dial and on/off switch.  My only complaint is that the dial and switch are on the inside of the iron, right next to the hot plates, a little strange for when I am trying to turn it off and not burn myself.",4
"I ordered this straightner after my cheap one from Target broke. After reading the reviews on Amazon and price shopping I decided to get this straightner. For $44 this was one heck of a deal! I've been using it for only a few days now. It did come with Argan Oil instead of the ""biosilk"" as it advertised but I was fine with that since Aragn Oil has become my go to hair product. I'm a bit disppointed with the product though. Yeah it gets the job done, but I was expecting something from a product that is worth $299. My cheapie from Target does just a well of a job as this straightner. It heats up slower than my target one, and doesn't straighten as well as I was hoping and I practically have the dial almost all the way up! I have medium thick hair and I have to run this straightner through it a few times more than what I should be. So while the price is great for the product and it's pretty much what I would spend at Walmart or Target for a straightner anyways, I'm just saying that if you're looking for a ""salon quality"" hair straightner I would go ahead and buy a Chi or ISO...",3
"I was looking to replace my Chi straightener and after researching online and on Amazon, decided on this one. At the time, my hair was long - to the middle of my back - and since it's fine, it's difficult to style. This straightener dragged across my hair instead of gliding across it, and also pulled at it, and it bent the ends under instead of curling them under. So, I had to pay to ship it back.",1
"Having read the reviews of this product, I purchased it for myself late last year.  The product worked quite well, up to and until the plates cracked and broke accidentally.  This product has a one-year warranty and when I contacted the manufacturer for a warranty replacement, I was told that accidental damage is not covered as this is a ""salon grade"" appliance and they will not replace my product.  DO NOT BUY!",1
"After my chi nano flat iron broke I decided to try another brand out. I have thick & wavy hair and after reading all of the excellent reviews for this flat iron I thought how can I go wrong with this one? WRONG! This flat iron is cheap, can not keep a steady heat setting, and constantly snags my hair. Every section I tried flat ironing it would snag my hair at the end. Maybe if you have thin hair this flat iron may work for you but otherwise save your money and time and keep researching....because this flat iron is horrible.",1
"I was wondering why this particular hair straightener had such high reviews..I've used a Chi all my life and a Sedu once and it was good, but I thought it would be nice to try other hair straighteners after I gave my Sedu away. I listened to the masses and purchased the HSI hair straightener. I wished I listened to the bad reviews...the straightener grabs onto your hair and does not have a smooth ceaseless movement that I associated with using my previous Sedu and Chi.  My hair didn't look vibrant or shiny after one go, it actually looked more dry and frizzy. Do not buy...I immediately returned it and went back to buying a Sedu hair straightener, which works great.",1
"When I buy something in Amazon, I always buy it new so I expect to receive something NOT used, NOT broken and NEW. I couldn't believe that as soon as I opened the box I saw broken seal, so I thought well .... I opened it and saw traces of oil on the flat iron, I checked the plates and one plate was chipped. I mean, SERIOUSLY???? It was not even working properly...C'mon guys, I'm buying something new! I'm Paying full price and everything.I'm returning the item ASAP! The worst shopping experience EVER.",1
"We bought this product and had high expectations because of the many glowing reviews.  I would not say that it worked any better than the $20 straightener that I had had for years and is still working well.  But, this morning, I heard a POP! and it is no longer turning on.  I have had this product for about 6 weeks, and of course, it is past the return window, so unless the company will allow me to return this, then it was a big waste of money.  I will update if I have any success.",1
I received a used one so had to send it back for a replacement.  Haven't used it yet because it's a gift.,1
"Thought the flat iron would work a little better, but maybe it's the humididty these days.",4
"I bought this straightener after my Jibere Tourmaline died after a faithful, yet monogamous 7 years (my current longest relationship, RIP). I still don't want to talk about it... I was enthralled when the box came to my door after not being able to straighten my hair for nearly a week (that's like a decade in hair years). I may have even danced & squealed like a high school girl being asked to the dance as I plugged it in... It's all quite vague to me now. As I opened the box, I remember the silkiness of the red travel bag it comes with being like that of the finest silk, fit for only a queen. With expectations high, I gently clamped down on my long black hair, and pulled the HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron through it... The clouds didn't part, heavens pearly gates didn't open, and the choir of angels didn't start their rendition of ""Hallelujah"". I then debated the thought that maybe I didn't give the HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron enough time to warm up. After all, the excitement of receiving it on my front door step may have deterred me from the sound logic that Rome wasn't built in a day, and just like Rome, the HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron must have needed more time to heat up. Just like the beginning of any relationship, I gave the hair straightener more time to get it together. After several minutes passed, with one swift but steady move (like that of a ninja), I once again pulled the heated plates through my hair...  The purest form of disappointment then began to flood my pearly gates and drowned me and my hair in its sorrows. Not only did it not work, but it also ripped my flowing hair from my scalp. The HSI Professional 1 inch Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron has now become something of the passed. It remains a dark chapter in my life that I would like to continue to keep closed and I think you should debate this fate as well. If you want sloppy seconds (and I mean SLOPPY), be my guest. But if you're looking for a hair straightener fit for Gods, I recommend looking somewhere else.  Moral of the story: There's nothing like your first... -Devo",1
"This flat iron will straighten your hair, though not with the smoothness of the Chi I've had for the past 5-6 years. It boasts a quick heat-up time which I have found to be an exaggeration. The indicator light is red while heating then turns green when your desired temperature us reached. Sometimes the light never turns green; although I use it and it does a fair enough job on my hair. However, I would not purchase this iron again.",2
"For some reason, this isn't working for me.  I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair, and it is wavy, not curly.  Have a natural wave in the back, which I wanted to straighten.  Just doesn't work for me.  I am going to get my hair cut, and try again.  Hopefully it will work with shorter hair?",1
"It looks as if if all of us who have recently purchased this item have been getting a defective one.  I've used almost every flat iron out there ranging from inexpensive to extremely expensive.  The Chi has been my choice for years.  This one came nicely packaged, but the iron was awful.  The material over the plates was peeling off, took a long time to heat up, snagged my hair, didn't straighten well, and heavy and uncomfortable.  My $20 Conair worked better.  I am very disappointed.",1
I bought a HSI Flat Iron for my daughter for christmas and she kept complaining that it was not working right and that she didn't like it. I just thought it was normal teenage daughter stuff till she was telling her hairdresser about it and the hairdresser said something must be wrong with it because I love mine and it heats up real fast (we were having trouble with that).  I contacted the company and even though it had been over 2 months they were absolutely wonderful to us!  They shipped us a new one right away and it works great!!!  She had used a CHI before but she loves the HSI much better. Now my daughter is much happier and that makes me(mom)happy.,3
"Both my wife and daughter says this iron leaves their hair frizzy.  We've always used the Sedu flat iron in the past.  Owned 3 and two quit working.  Thought I'd try to find another product that could replace the Sedu at a better cost and the HSI flat iron definitely was not it.  Planned to submit a return to Amazon as I received it late last month, but I'm two days past my return window.  Really not liking the Amazon 30 day return policy.  Most stores will go out to 90 days.  Get with the program Amazon, online shopping should be a little more forgiving in this department.",1
Previous model was an expensive CHI which worked good but lately doesn't heat up hot enough.Looking for something less pricey since the competition is everywhere now for this product.The HSI grips the hair and pulls some out.  Couldn't use it more than 3 times before giving up.Fortunately returns back to the vendor via Amazon was no problem and full refund. Thanks!!!!We bought this Revlon model and is way smoother.  Used Revlon now for 6 months and very happy with it.http://www.amazon.com/Remington-S8510DS-Flat-Frizz-Therapy/dp/B008U5XS2O/ref=sr_1_11?s=beauty&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1379019218&sr;=1-11&keywords;=revlon+flat+iron,1
"I was really excited to get this iron after reading all the positive reviews. However, after using it I can say that this is a terrible iron. First, it pulls my hair horribly. Second, I'm not sure the plates are really ceramic. It reminds me of some of the first flat irons on the market from years ago...just hot plates that seem like metal and not ceramic. Third, it took several passes to actually straighten my hair good. My hair was fairly straight to begin with as I had blew it dry with a large round brush. Also, my hair isn't resistant at all, so I'm not sure why it was difficult to get it straight with this flat iron. The iron did get really hot though. There was no slip even though I use a light smoothing serum (something I could use or not use with my old Barbar flat iron and still get good results). This resulted in ""hot spots,"" which is terrible for your hair. If you want a good flat iron, this isn't it folks--not if you are used to the higher end brands because this doesn't compare, at all! Save your $30 and put it towards something better because this is a waste. I am a licensed professional (since 1996) and have used a lot of different irons...Barbar is really good although it does pull some (very little effort and you have straight silky hair)...Chi and Fahrenheit are okay, Keyoseki is good but is a p.o.c. and doesn't last long,  T3--is way over-hyped, Biosilk is mediocre. I hope this helps!",1
"My husband purchased this straightener for me to replace a 6 year old ceramic straightener. I believe it was a mid grade item at the time. Anyway, I ordered this because it was on sale as a lightning deal, and hoped it would be an upgrade from my hair tugging old one.Firstly, I want to say I have naturally curly hair, just below my shoulders, medium thickness, and I do not color it. So, it is a pain to straighten, but is healthy overall. The HSI came with a nice storage pouch, and a glove. The oil sample was supposed to come with my product, but did not. The item has a nice weight to it, and the controls are easy enough. When I turn it on, it heats up quickly (has a red light that turns green when ready).With that said, I found that the HSI got hot, but did not stay hot. I think that I straigtened my hair with the light red the whole time, simply because every swipe I did lost the heat it had stored. I had to make quite a few swipes to each section to straighten my hair, and I felt it was staticky afterwards.I first used this item at night before bed, and I noticed that it did not hold its the flatness after bed that night (I may toss and turn alot, but my hair shouldn't be curly again in the morning). I re-straightened it in the morning, and it held it ok until later in the day. I did not notice any crazy amount of hair-pulling with this, but a few strands did get stuck.So, overall, I guess it works, but I don't think I will keep it. The heat loss alone makes me dissatisfied. What good is a temperature control dial if it doesn't maintain it's temperature. Even though it is a decent deal price wise, I would rather buy an iron that I can use long term and be happy with. I believe I will be returning this.",3
"This item was not made well, i have frizzy hair not really thick more like thin and it would not straighten it at all. This product i thought would be amazing because of the views but it was not at all. Also the argon oil i thought would be a little bit bigger and it was so small. I always used a CHI and i wanted something cheaper. I should of stuck with the CHI because it lasted me 4 years and so now im going buy another CHI and have to spend allot more money but better quality. There is one thing i can say though is that AMAZON is amazing with returns i got back my money and shipping i paid within 5 days and they emailed me and everything when it went back in my account so i must say amazon customer service is fantastic! but if your looking for a good hair straightener go for the CHI anyone is great and Paul Mitchell i heard is great too. :)",1
"This product had great reviews so I ordered it but I am not very happy with it. The straighter is great, it doesn't snag or pull my hair at all. The only problem is that is doesn't stay heated while I use it.  It gets annoying letting it reheat while trying to get ready for the day, I just went back to using my old one.",2
"I bought this straightener on sale for $56. Lucky me, my old cheap one broke in time to catch this great deal. Its amazing! I love this straightener, buy it! :)",5
"This flat iron definately straightened my hair quickly so that is a plus. But, it did leave my hair with split ends after a few days of using it. It did make my hair a little frizy but over all it is a good straightner for the money. I will try turning the heat down to see if that helps with the frizziness. OVER ALL, IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.",4
"I am black and have THICK curly hair. I did an asymetrical chop in October and when I read about this straightener I wasn't sure about it but c'mon 30 bucks? You can't beat that. I was originally looking up a ghd straightener and that was a bit out of the budget so I went with this one. I washed my hair with motions for natural textures heat styler shampoo and leave in conditioner. I was too lazy to blow dry my hair so I just brushed it out til my curls weren't as tight (I know this is lazy but I did it cuz I'm the WORST when it comes to straightening my hair: takes too long and my arm hurts blah blah ya know the struggle lol). When I sectioned it out and got to straightening it worked! HSI did such a good job that the results were as good as if I used my friends ghd (I've used her ghd multiple times and I liked how it treated my hair but hers doesn't have a heat dial like this hsi does yay!). The size is 1inch but I was afraid that it was too small and I'd be sittin FOREVER straightening my hair, but nope! It took the reg 2-2.5 hrs of straightening (I have really curly hair mind you AND i didn't blow dry my hair cuz I am lazy lol so thats why it took forever). The next day to retouch my hair it only took about 30-45 mins and I was so happy! I was flippin my hair and gettin fancy with it! I did a few curls here and there lol but to end this LONG review I LOVE IT!!! BUY IT YOULL BE HAPPY! OH the free argan oil is a small foil pack, I thought I was getting a botlly lmaoo but its still a good deal!",5
"ACCORDING TO MY WIFE, IT DRY'S HER HEAR.  A GOOD IRON LEAVE THE HAIR SHINY AND THIS ONE LEAVES IT DRY",3
I was very excited to get this flat iron after reading reviews here on Amazon. I decided to buy this and try it myself. My hair is normal and fairly straight. It was quick to heat up to the max 410 degrees and the LED turned green once heated. I noticed that as I began to straighten my hair it felt as if the heat started to drop. I'd look at the LED and it was at Red again. My outlets were just fine and the cord on the straightener was intact. The plates are not as smooth when doing your hair. It felt like it was tugging my hair.Got my money back for this purchase. Amazon does have great Customer Service :),2
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas..  It stopped working Jan 15th!  I can't return it because I'm passed the return window!  I guess this has taught me not to buy electric items on the internet!  UGH!,1
"Structurally this is a good tool; however, it does not hold a candle to any Chi Straighter! I decided to purchase the HSI Straightener after my Chi of 4 years stopped working in some electrical outlets. I decided to give a new product a try. I decided on this one due to being a best seller. I wonder how many people have returned it! You get what you pay for. This straightener took 3x as long to straighten my hair then the Chi and I have chin length hair!! I had to keep going over my wavy hair and it was on the highest setting! My advice, spend a little more money! Although I am saddened my Chi didn't last more than 4 years, I will buy another Chi! Probably in Pink!!",3
"The one I got was in a very bad quality that when I close it on my hair, the spring wont open it fully. I find this thing to be bad in quality. I don't use mine anymore, I bought another one.",1
I purchased this product as a gift. My daughter-in-law was thrilled with it. i don't know anything else about it. I just gave it three stars because i don't know anything about it as I said it was a gift.,3
Read the reviews and thought it was a good buy but my wife was not happy with it at all. She said it doesnt get hot enough. She was used to a Chi tho so I guess you get what you pay for. Its all what your used too. I wouldnt recommend. Will be returning.,1
"I decided to buy this for my wife because it has fairly good reviews when her hair iron burnt out.  She originally had a Chi.  Unfortunately this is nothing like the Chi, it takes much longer, doesn't have as good of a finish... overall very disappointing.  The unit we were provided may just be weak or not working properly since deliver..but regardless I wouldn't recommend.",1
"I have been using a CHI straighten for years and finally it died, so after reading some of the reviews and seeing the price I though I would give it a try.  I returned it the next day.  I have very curly and very thick hair.  It takes about an hour to straighten it, so time is important, I don't want to be standing there even longer.  This straighten didn't even get half as hot as my old straightener did, and I was going over sections of my hair 4-5 times.  It took forever to straighten my hair.My advice spend the extra money and get a better quality product.",1
I have used a chi and Conair flat irons and wanted to try HSI and this sounded like a good offer but I was very disappointed in the product.  my Conair that I got @ cvs for @$25.00 does so much better than this item... seems like it is poorly made or the product is made of cheap material.,2
"The metal plates tug on stray hairs when im sliding the straightener down my hair. Thats annoying. I guess its a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of product. I really didn't want to spend plus $80 for a hair styling tool so now im stuck with a mediocre hair straightener. It does the job.",3
"The flat iron plate is short, only 3-1/2"" long, which is not stated on the packaging.  Difficult to use in real life.  The free Argan oil sample advertised is misleading.  The advertised sample shows a bottle.  What you get is a flat, one-use squeeze-out packet.",1
"This is a nice, heavy flat iron that gets really hot.  However after using it for a while, my hair was in horrible shape.  The ends were all split and my previous flat iron never caused that.  I finally quit using it and went back to my previous one.",3
"I had assumed an item that was purchased so frequently and given such high ratings would be great. But this straightener does not heat up as it claims. I have a Fifteen dollar straightener I purchased from Walmart that gets hotter than this one. Hopefully it does the job anyway as I have course, wavy hair :)",3
This flat iron is not professional grade. It pulls your hair and causes dryness. It does not glide down your hair smoothly. I would not recommend this purchase. you get the quality you paid for - cheap.,2
"The fact that this iron does not have an auto shut-off feature is a huge disappointment. I bought this to replace an old Revlon flat iron that I used for years, and it would shut off after 35 minutes of use to prevent fires.This one does not. Very unusual for hot irons these days, it is almost standard for safety now.",2
"I decided to get this flatiron instead of the Chi because it has solid ceramic plates, and the Chi didn't, were just coated. It was hard to find a flatiron with solid ceramic plates under $100.  Also like that it is digital and has automatic shut-off.  Heats fairly quickly, hair feels sort of softer after using.  Haven't used the oil that came with it yet.  Still having trouble using it curl my hair, I have thick, course, and curly hair, but tends to get frizzy in summer. Still have trouble at the highest setting.  My friends Chi seemed to work better on my hair, even though it just has coated plates.",4
"I bought this flat iron because of all the great reviews, but buyer beware!  I've had many flat irons prior to this one, and after all the amazing reviews I thought I would give it a try.  This iron pulls your hair it does not flow smoothly through your hair like the chi.  I would not recommend this flat iron to anyone I know.",1
"So I read all the good reviews about HSI professional, and decided to upgrade by buying this straightener. But I was disappointed the first time I used it. I have pretty much silky but frizzy hair which is wavy. The first time I used it, it took me double the time to straighten my hair. I let it pre-heat and when the green light flashed, I started using it. Every 30-40 seconds the light would switch back to red (heating stage). The second time I tried using it , I switched the temp setting to full heat (though I doubt my hair needs such a high temperature), I still faced the problem, where the light would switch between red- green, and it took forever for my hair to straighten. This product is definitely going to be returned.",1
"I bought the iron thinking it will be a great replacement for my old remington flat iron, since I have heard a lot of positive reviews about it, but l was wrong. I tried to use it, and it was terrible,  it was pulling my hair out so bad that I had to stop using it and finish straightening with my old iron. The plates are not aligned properly, it has a big gap on one end when you close plates together, unless you press it very hard. I liked the design and size otherwise. I am going to return it.",1
"The product plus the box picture shows dual voltage for worldwide (110-240V) use but the product it self is labeled as 110-120V.Amazon refunded money and reordered another one, however the new hair straightener also is listed as 110-120v only. Either the product is mislabeled or the box is misprinted. It seems no one can inspect the product at Amazon to verify voltage.Update: Seller finally contacted me and assured me that the product is is 110-240V but it was mislabeled by the manufacturer. Ended not taking it overseas so I will never know if it's Dual voltage.",3
"Title says it all, item didn't even work upon arrival. Returned for a refund. Didn't order a replacement as item didn't seem well made, cheap plastic.",1
I got it thinking it was a great deal seeing as how it was originally over $150 and I got it for $40 but it sucks. I have curly hair and it snags my hair and doesn't get nearly as hot as my $40 one from target that I bought 2 years ago. Definitely a fail,1
I used the Chi for many years and it was destroying my hair!  It only had one heat setting and that was blazing hot.  This along with the Argan Oil makes my hair so soft and smooth.  Best thing I decided to do.  Saving my hair now!,4
"I have owned several straighteners from a lower end, all the way up to a higher end Chi. I was in need of a new iron, badly. The one we have now is starting to pull your hair, you know, the one single short hair that happens to always be at the knapp of your neck? WTH? I was a bit skeptical at first as the price was so low. I just kept saying to myself, ""you get what you pay for!"" BUT, I read all of the comments and almost every single one was good. So, I figured what the heck let's see what all the fuss was about, and ordered it. It arrived on time as it stated. When I removed it from the box, I knew just by handling it, it was well made and was going to be an amazing straightener. It also came with a hot glove, a sample of HSI Argon Oil and a pretty red carrying case.  I was finally able to sit down and get some one on one time and I was very, very satisfied. It straightens my hair with one stroke. It leaves my hair feeling like silk and looking even better!  Thank you for making such a wonderful product and making it affordable! I'm going to order some Argon Oil and now I'm thinking about a blow dryer!I would definitely recommend this to a friend, neighbor or a stranger on the street that needed a good straighten!!",5
"My wife received this based on the strong reviews, and it worked fine the first few times she tried it.  The on the third try, it no longer worked.  Wouldn't heat up, regardless of what we did.  We reset the power outlet, and still nothing.Sent a letter of complaint to both Amazon and HSI, letting them know that we did all the standard trouble shooting (resetting the power button on the outlet, etc) and here's what happened:HSI response:  Press harder on the reset button for the power outlet.  (We already let you know we reset it... pressing harder really won't help the defective product).Amazon response:  Print it out, and we'll refund you!  (Only to find out after we sent it back, they deducted $10 off for restocking... what are you restocking?  A defective item?)  UPDATE:  Amazon corrected the restocking fee after contacting them.  Great customer service, and what I've come to expect from Amazon!",3
"I really wanted to like this iron, as it was a replacement for a CHI iron that just quit on me out of the blue. But, it arrived and I immediately put it to work and found that it snagged and pulled at my hair. It may be because the plates don't come together evenly, so some hair remains caught in the plates while other hair is let loose. I am not really sure why, but I can see uneven gapping when I look at the plates as they are pressed together. I need a flat iron that does not pull at my layered hair. It is going back.",2
"I've been using a 2+year old Remington straighter and it was getting a bit squeaky so I decided to try this straightener out since it's apparently amazing with it's 2000+ reviews.I gotta say that I am a bit disappointed with this purchase. The first straighter I received was defective and didn't heat up properly, even at 400 degrees. At the lowest setting, there wasn't any heat, and at the highest setting, it seemed to be at the lowest heat setting. My old straighter has a LED thermostat and I swear it heats up hotter at 320 degrees than this one does at over 400.Also, while I am using the straightener, the light that indicates if it's completely heated turns from green to red. This tells me that while  the plates are together, it shuts off and when you release it, it begins to heat up again. Must be bad wiring or something because even my cheapo 20 dollar straighter doesn't do this.Blue Novelties, the company I purchased this on amazon from was kind enough to immediate ship me a replacement after I informed them of this issue.I got the placement and upon using it, it seemed to work fine on the lowest heat setting so I assumed it would work even better on the highest. This wasn't the case. It started experiencing the same problems as the first one they sent me, light turning red while in use, and not heating up to the degree indicated on the dial. It seems to heat a up a bit more than the first one I received but it still kind of sucks and it takes me longer to straighten my hair than my old, beat up straightener.Overall, I am a bit disappointed with this product. It does straighten my hair after like 30 minutes of use compared to 15 minutes with my old straightener, but I didn't pay 50 bucks to waste more time.",3
"It does what it is supposed to do.  I bought this on a lightening deal and feel that I paid a fair price for it, but it does not have features I would expect it to have given it's list price.  For example, the temperature selector shows that the iron heats to 410 deg at it's highest, but gives you no indication on the dial any other temp at any other point from beginning to the 410 deg mark.  The iron comes with a satin case for storage and a heat resistant glove to assist with certain styling techniques.",4
"(I have type 4 hair w/ some extensions and a keratin treatment:)I decided to buy this flat iron due to the fact that it wasconsiderably 'marked down' and I was in desperate need for one.However, it struck me as odd how this item is only sold on Amazonand is able to maintain an almost 5 star rating with over 2,000 reviews, and it's'dirt cheap' considering it was $300 but is now $40 weird...but, I took the chance and I'm here to say I LOVE IT!I had bought the InStyler a few years back for around $100, but I'm surprised to saythat this HSI is MUCH better! I did notice my hair was very soft and had some shineafter straightening it, but I think that has to do with the factthat I got a keratin treatment more than anything else.Overall: Buy it, it's a good straightener that can also flip and curl. Good buy.",5
"I had to replace my CHI and bought this based on the reviews. It is comparable to the CHI, and a great price. Would recommend.",4
"I bought this straightener based on Amazon popularity, excellent reviews and low price. It is an ok product, probably worth the price but not at all what I was looking for. My great salon grade straightener died after 4 years of usage and the HSI is nowhere near as good. It does not get hot enough (even in the highest setting), it keeps getting cool after every strand of hair I iron which is super annoying and it takes at least 3 times to straighten one strand of hair (and my hair is NOT curly) and it's still not perfectly smooth and silky like with my old one. My old one was way more expensive (closer to $80) but since I haven't bought one for 4 years I thought the new ones are same quality but less expensive now.",3
"I purchased this flat iron to replace my aging Chi. The reviews were great so I decided to give it a chance. It worked great for a couple weeks, but when I got it out to use yesterday I realized the plates were cracked and broken. I had not been rough with it/thrown it around, so I am very disapointed.",2
Excellent device great results on the hairPlain and simple in useBest results when the hair is dry is moistened with water,5
I love it! It was easy to use and I love the glove that was added to protect from heat of iron.  It had an awesome red bag to store  it in as well.,5
I got the straightener very quickly in the mail. I'm usually skeptical about hair products and appliances and wanted to check out this straightener. I'm an amazon prime member and couldn't believe how much this item was. I'm impressed- this straightener makes my hair look professional every time!,5
"I liked the flat iron - results were great.The Argan oil is good quality, howver it is a small portion.",5
I ordered this straightener because my other straightener wasnt doing the job anymore. I really like how smooth and shiny this straightener makes my hair look and feel. So far so good!,4
"This straightener works great! I have thick hair and i wasn't sure if it would work, but after reading the other reviews i thought I'd give it a try and am very pleased. Plus, you can't beat the price!",5
"This hair straightener was bought for my daughter.  She has curly hair, but she has been able to manage her hair very well with this straightener.  It makes her hair shiny and look healthy.  Great product!  Very satisfied with product and with price.",5
Great straightener and an even better price! I have thick long wavy hair and it straightens it perfectly. Wonderful product!,5
"At first glance, this product looks great. However, after using it, I am not completely impressed. First, the straightener takes a really long time to heat up and it also doesn't get that hot. Second, the end of the plates catch my hair and break it, way more than my cheapo Revlon brand straightener. Also, I wish it did have a automatic shut off switch. My hair feels smooth afterwards, but I think it is just because of the sample oil that came with the product. Overall, I feel this straightener is average and wouldn't recommend.",3
"I was really excited because of the thousands of 5 star reviews this thing got. My hair is really curly and fine. After I straighten my hair, it looks great for 30 minutes and then it starts to curl again. I've heard that this straightener tames even the unruliest hair.So, even though I'm a college student on a budget, I splurged $40 on this two days ago and got it in the mail yesterday (my family has amazon prime). The argan oil/carrying pouch were a nice touch. The straightener, however, wasn't that great. It looked used and the ceramic plates were chipped. I emailed HSI directly and told them about my situation. They told me to mail it directly to them for an exchange. First of all, they sent me a defective piece. And now they want me to pay to ship it back to them? No thanks. Returning it to amazon today. I know there are a ton of other reviews talking about the great customer service, but I'm just not feeling it.I'm sure the straightener is great, but I think I'll be buying another brand because of this whole fiasco.UPDATE: I just bought the Remington 1 inch one and it was only $15 (perfect for college students like me). It heats up very fast (it can go up to 410 degrees), is lightweight, and came in pristine condition. It gave me pin straight hair, which no straightener I have previously had could do. My hair was straight even after sleeping on it. I curled my hair with it too! Bottom line: There are many better, cheaper straighteners out there, so keep looking!",2
"I bought this product based on the rave reviews and the low price. I figured at that low price, it was worth a shot. But I now see it offered for several different prices, which I find fishy. I also think all these new reviews are suspicious as well. I'm questioning how legit this company is. Anyway... I did not receive the oil that others are raving about. It came with a cheap looking glove and a red cover. The straightener itself is not all that impressive. It gets hot but after using it once, I can say that I think this is going back. I could feel my hair breaking. It doesn't smoothly glide through my hair the way my CHI does. In my opinion, this is no better than any other $40 straightener you can buy at Target.",2
"I ordered this straightener just a few days ago, and I was so excited to get it and use it for the first time! Shipping was really quick and I was pleasantly surprised that I got my item a day before the estimated date. So finally, I ripped open my package and pulled out my straightener, and it was defective. Everything looked ok and it may have even worked alright, but it has a loose part that was rattling underneath the barrel when I took it out. Who knows what exactly was making that noise, but I knew it wasn't going to be the best product if something on the inside was broken. I immediately got on amazon to fill out an exchange form so I could return the broken straightener for a new one when I realized that I could only get a refund because it wasn't sold by amazon but just fulfilled by amazon. So now I have to return the item, wait for it to process, get my refund, then order and new one, and then hopefully the next one won't be defective. :( and I was so excited.....",2
"Hello, I Ordered on October 27th recieved November 6th (10 days later) with free supersaver shipping. I ordered this item while it was on Gold box deal for 29.99 for my wife. She loves it. Says it made her hair feel very soft and managable. Not like straw like her old one. I'm happy that I picked a good gift this time. :)The item looks and feels very sturdy while being light also. Has an on and off button and temp control that works well. (my wife says)Thank you for reading my review. I would buy another for the regular price 39.99 anytime. Very nice product.",5
"I just got this straightener in the mail today, very high quality, works great! Curls perfectly as well. Feels like I'm practically stealing this $300 straightener for $40!",5
"I just recieved this, not only did it get here quick and as promised, it works great! I have very heavy, very curly hair and this iron straightened my hair like no other Iron I've ever used! Its a very well made, very sturdy product!",5
"I have used many store bought flat irons before and have always been mad at wasting the $20-50 for each one. Many have damaged my hair and don't work as well as the ones at the salon. I got this one on sale from Amazon and was incredibly happy at how great it works. I no longer use any other flat iron and very few other curling irons. This one does it all, straighten or curl my hair, just like the salon. I could not be happier with this product.",5
"This is a great flat iron. It straightens my, thick, relaxed hair in ""one pass""...on medium temp.  I don't have to ""stall"" the iron on my hair. Just one quick pass and my hair is straight. This baby gets hot.  If I used on the high setting, my hair would be scorched, but for super thick or extremely curly natural textured hair this flat iron will get hair straight quickly and efficiently on the higher settings.The temperature control knob/on-off button are located inside of this flat iron.  The temperature control knob doesn't have numeric temperature markings, except at the highest and lowest settings, but it is easy to gauge the temperature ranges best suited for your hair type.  For first time users, I would recommend starting at the low temp and gradually increasing to temperature best suited for your hair type.It heats up in a few seconds. HSI included a thermal glove. They've also included a nice satin storage bag and a sample bottle of heat protectant oil.For me, this flat iron helps stretch my relaxer. It straightens my new growth very effectively. Now, I only need to touch up every 5 or 6 months. I do the whole nine yards in my hair care.... regular trims, co-wash, deep conditioners, protein treatments, hot oil treatments, heat protectants, etc.  My hair can take this heat and stay healthy, but too frequent relaxing will damage my hair. This product is a godsend for me.  HSI is the best flat iron I've ever used.On another note, for anyone leery of intensive protein treatment products, but still in need of a good protein treatment, you may try using raw eggs. Beat an egg, apply to shampooed  and towel dried hair. Let set for 15 minutes...no heat required,(but a plastic cap can be used). Then rinse thoroughly. Follow with a good moisturizing conditioner.  It's a little messy, but its a safe inexpensive fix...much cheaper that products like Kerafuse. The egg treament is very effective for breaking and brittle hair. The egg protein will firm up the hair texture, so following with a moisturizing conditoner is still necessary.  If hair is breaking, one treatment a week is a good protocol. I've had fabulous results using the raw eggs, when I experienced excessive shedding after using a relaxer. The breakage stopped.",5
This straightens hair like a charm! I paid 3x more for a different product and this does the same thing! Super pleased with it.,5
"My beloved Chi straightner died last week.  I quickly got on Amazon and researched hair straightners. There were a ton of options, but I chose the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch because of the awesome reviews and excellent price! I ordered it and received it two days later. It came with a thermal heat glove and cover which I condisered it a bonus because I paid much more for the Chi 3 years ago and it didn't come with anything. It gets hot, but it's not too hot that it damages my hair. It's a great balance.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.",5
"I have thick, semi-curly hair that's pretty unruly. I've used A LOT of straighteners over the years, and so far this is the best! It kept my hair straight all day (even with a little bit of rain off and on), and felt great. However, it really didn't feel that hot, even at the max temp (410), it took me less time to straighten it than usual, but I still found myself having to re-straighten some of the thicker layers a bunch of times. It also heats up extremely quickly (huge time saver) and I got it for an awesome price (39.99 + free shipping) which was great, so overall I definitely recommend this product! My hair is just hard to tame, so I'm sure anyone with a little bit thinner hair than me will have a great experience.",4
This is a really nice professional straightener! The cord is really long and the ceramic plates are really nice. It makes my hair so silky and soft after using it!,5
"I've used several irons (conair, chi, gamma...) and this was my first experience with HSI. What I can say is that this iron is great quality and price. I love it! I don't regret have bought it. I have wavy hair and in just some minutes I can get my hair done, pretty and shinny. And you can also use it to get curls and waves. Absolutely worth buying product! And I love that the cable doesn't entangles easily as other irons do.",5
"I just recently purchased this flat iron after the first use I am hooked. I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. I would often go to the salon and pay $85 or more for the same results that I got with this $40 flat iron!!! The Flat iron heats up quickly and there is an indicator light to let you know it is on. They included a small bottle of Argan oil, a glove and a nice reuseable pouch to keep the flat iron in after use. It also comes with instructions just in case...A great buy and money saver!!!",5
"I bought this to replace my 7 years old CHI. Wanted to try something different. After reading all the wonderful reviews about the product, I purchased it and couldn't be any happier. I love that it has different settings for different types of hair.",5
"I have very course but fine hair (crazy mixture but it's true) that is hard to style.  Add to that I live in Florida where the humidity is a  style killer most of the year.  I have purchased every flat iron i can get my hands on and most of them are okay, but the HSI is the only on that has made my hair smooth and soft for the entire day.  I even wake up with better looking hair the day after I flat iron!",5
"I bought this straightener, and when I received it, I tried it and was immediately impressed. Price was very good, for such a good product. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair, and even this made it pin straight and smooth. Definitely recommend it.",5
I loved this flat iron because it is light weight and works great. Doesn't take long to heat up and it comes with a glove so you don't burn your other hand. My hair hasn't looked this great in a long time. Appreciated the sample of argon oil too.,5
This is the best straightener I have ever owned. It heats up quickly and works amazingly well. My teenage daughters keep stealing it from me!,5
"This is my first flat iron, so I'm not really able to compare how it works with other flat irons. However, I can say that it works very well. It has variable heat control up to 400 degrees, so that it will work on all different hair types. The ceramic plates heat up quickly (less than a minute for the lower temps, which are what I use), and the handle and outside surfaces of the iron remain cool. I really like that the cord swivels 360 degrees so that it doesn't get twisted or caught when you use the iron. Also, the flat iron comes with a glove to protect your hand and a sample of argan oil. Of course, you can't beat the price either. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",5
works well. gets you hair really hot so it hard to hold when styling but gets your hair straight. I hav naturally curly fizzy hair and it takes the high temp.,4
The HSI flat iron works wonderful. The adjustable temp is great for different hair types in the house. The iron warms up quickly and does a wonderful job of straightening. I have VERY curly hair and this iron make short work of pulling those out. Great iron!!,5
"This produce was processed and shipped very quickly and packaged properly., It came with extras such as a flat iron case argan oil and a protective glove. The flat iron works great. I am very pleased with this product.",5
This straightener is AWESOME! I have very curly hair and I get great results in super quick time. I have been struggling with an inferior straightener and wish I'd got this one earlier. I don't even use the hottest setting - it does the job without it so I feel like it is gentler on my hair.Plus the customer service is fantastic. I couldn't be happier.,5
"I was amazed by this flat-iron.  I got professional results that lasts for days using this flat-iron.  It comes with a glove which I came to quickly appreciate once I used it.  It achieved very high temperatures and gets excellent results with minimal effort.  By far, my favorite!",5
"Eventough I don't have curly hair, it's been hard for me to find an iron that gets my hair straightened cleanly. This iron worked really well, heats fast, and has a fair price.",4
I expected the product to be more professional but it was ok for the prize. My chi straightener is still my preferred one.,3
It takes me an hour to straighten my hair usually. I was able to do it in 20 with this product. I can't wait to start playing around with it and use it to curl my hair.Great product!,4
Wasn't sure how this was going to do as it was on sale and fairly cheap. It exceeded our expectations and we have been very pleased with it. Would recommend to others.,4
"I bought this in June of 2011 (last year). I have thick frizzy hair. It worked okay for the first few weeks. The light would turn green to let me know it was hot enough. The green light feature quit working about a month after I bought it.  I moved right around the time I purchased it, so I thought maybe the change in climate was the reason my hair wasn't getting as straight as with my previous iron. It wasn't until I got my hair cut recently and the hairdresser used a flat iron that made my hair silky-smooth that I remembered how a flat iron is supposed to work. This iron straightens a little, but it doesn't really do away with frizz like a good flat iron should and can do.",3
"This is the best flat iron I've ever used, makes my hair nice and silky... I'm African American and have really long hair, I also have two daughters with long hair and this iron did the wonders for us. I will be ordering two more for my girls, because they love it so much. Great product at a great price!!",5
"I got this straightener to replace one that I'd had for about 6 years that finally died on me.  I have extremely thick, frizzy, curly, dry, ""ethnic"" hair and prior to my last iron I was continuously spending money trying to find an iron that would straighten my hair without burning it out. I considered buying a more expensive iron because many of my friends have one of two particular brands and love them, but I saw the rave reviews for the HSI on amazon and decided to give it a shot. I've been using this iron for a bit now and I'm pretty impressed with how well it gets the job done; in my opinion, HSI straightens just as well as those ""good"" irons of my friends that I tried out.  I would definitely recommend it!",5
"Pros- It does get hot, fast. Cons- I've had mine for a year and the ceramic plate is cracked. I was happier with a cheaper Infinity brand straightener that I had for five years. I think I will try a Chi this time.",3
I bought this a couple a months ago for my daugther. She needed to replace her chi.THis iron works as good. Recomended and the price was great.,5
"The HSI flat iron is easy to use, makes my hair look fantastic and is just as good (if not better) than the $100 ceramic flat iron I bought my daughter a few months ago. Looks and feels sturdy and not too heavy. Good quality.",5
"Best deal I have ever gotten. I love this straightener! And for such a great deal.  Also got free product with my order ! Quick delivery as well,  very impressed.",5
"gloves are easy on/off, fit well but giving material which fits different hand types. They cover your hands right down to your nails so your skin isn't exposed to the UV light.  I definitely recommend using them when having your nails done at a salon or at home.",5
"I love this straightener.  I purchased it after looking at all the reviews.  It heats up quickly, stays hot and does the job.  I brought it to work to finish my hair one day and the two girls I work with fell in love with it too.  I have fine strands but really thick hair.  One girl has thick, course, curly hair and the other has thick, fine hair as well.  It works on all of our hair.  I recommend it, especially for the price!",5
"I ordered this straightener as a surprise for my wife.  She loves it, says just one pass through her hair and it's straight.",5
"Wasn't sure if I would like this brand as I have never used it before but I do love it.  It doesn't take long to heat up and it doesn't frizz my hair like some of the others I have used.  This is a superb product especially for the price. I would recommend trying this product, you won't be disappointed. The storage bag and glove are added bonus.",5
Great flat iron! Heats quickly works very well even on my thick and wavy hair... Great deal for this price!!!,5
"I was looking for a really nice flat iron at a reasonable price. After looking at several, settled on this one since the reviews were fairly great and priced very well. Arrived quickly and put it to use right away. Love the option of dialing up the temp when needed, LOVE the extra long cord (I believe it is about 8 feet) as the one I used before was rather short and inconvenient, enjoy having the glove to use and not burning my fingers anymore and the travel bag was a nice add-on that came with the box.  If the iron keeps working as it has been, I will be very happy with my purchase...So far, so good!",5
"This product is worth every cent! It makes you want to become a hairdresser, because you finally have the right tool, to straighten hairl!",5
"Heats up fast and straightens my wavy hair perfectly.  The packaging is very nice, with a silky red case and glove.  Comes with a sample of argon oil, which I love.",5
I am not a review writer but after I used this product I feel to write a review. This is really awesome. I have naturally curled hair and nobody can tell that after I straightened my hair with HSI!!!!!! My hair looks shiny soft. I loved it.But still I'm confused about how to register for 1 year warrenty.,5
"My hair is short and I was able to straighten my thick, curly, coarse hair easily.But the true test was on my sister's hair, which is even thicker and coarser and much longer than mine.  Her hair was mostly straight.  Half way through the job, the straightener wasn't enough.  I think next time I'll have to turn the straightener off and then wait a while to let it cool down again.But it definitely straightened my hair nicely.",4
"I got this as a gift for a friend and she loved it! She is African American and has coarse natural hair. She says that the flat iron made her hair soft, straight, and smooth!",5
It was good with the price. I am satisfied with the product.This was my first purchase on flat iron.It works good to straighten my hair.,4
Lightweight and easy to use. Able to get close to the root . Unlike other flat irons I have tried I am not sweating while trying to use it. Love this product sorry I waited so long to try.,5
"I got this straightner for my girlfriend after her last one melted, she loves it. Nothing bad to say about it but that its a great straightner",5
"I decided to give the HSI flat iron a try after my CHI died on me. Considering how inexpensive the HSI flat iron was, I didn't really have high hopes for it. I figured it would, at the very least, be a temporary solution until I was ready to shell out the money for a new CHI. I was pleasantly surprised! The HSI flat iron surpassed my expectations, making my curly, frizzy hair appear much smoother than it did when I used the CHI. I highly recommend this flat iron!!",5
This is my very first flat iron that i have owned. I have very curly hair and used this product in the morning before work without troubles. The heat is adjustable and the iron was very easy to use even without the glove provided. It heats up in a short amount of time and cools down relatively fast.,5
Works GREAT!!!  I had never used one before and this one is easy and works just GREAT!!!  The description isn't totally accurate because it doesn't say just how easy and well this works...I love my haircut now:),5
"great deal.good price.ive used 3 x already.1st time with argon oil and blow dry, took 2 hours, my hair is really curly and about an inch past my hsoulders, turned out really great, shiny healthy. real cute.2nd time, no argon oil, no blow dry. not that great.3rd time=best. used african hair oil to moisterize and no blow dry but the flat iron did such a great job i got sooo many compliments aand after 6 days, my hair is still in great shape. the ends look good and the roots do too. i think the mosterizer i used locks in and keeps hair from frizzing so easy.those just my tips for actually using it. if you have extra time to blow dry, do it but if not just make sure hair almost dry (i prefer air dry) and use good moisterizer.as far as snags of hair, ive seen lot reviews talk about that. maybe when brand new didnt snag but after first use i definitely notices hair snags.doesnt bother me that much plus i might be rushing or handing my hair rough so i dont really mind that as much.the size and width of it is great for handling. my last chi was not really as ergonomically fit. cord swivels out of way when necessary. easy to flip and rotate around if in rush and all.gets really reallly hot.pretty good deal for 40 dollars.only thing bothered me was after bying this and reading so many great reviews my bff told me she bought one from walmart for 40 that got really hot and worked well, she was happy with it but it was way more girly and had special designs and stuff so maybe if you appreicate more designs something not so basic, check walmart.oh and comes with silky holder and little jar argon for free and glove that i havent used 1x but pretty good package overall.would buy again. and would recommend",5
"This straighten worked better for my hair than a CHI. It makes my hair look smooth and soft unlike other straighteners that sometimes made it look almost greasy. I would definitely recommend this to future buyers. Don't waste money on over-priced straightens that may not work as well.[[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]",5
"Other then the fact it came on time, which is always a plus, I have nothing negative to say about it so far! Just used for the first time and it did an amazing job! Nice touch by the way with the red silk cover and glove. Lets just say that for the past ten years of straightening my hair, i have replaced my CHi 5 times-thats every 2 years!! They just randomly die. Honestly for 39.99 I'm shocked it could be this good..but worth it so far and I debated this for quite some time.",5
"The HSI flat iron straightener is perfect for smoothing the frizz out of my thick, curly hair. My hair is dry and fragile and the lowest setting is just what I needed and the reason I picked this product.  I hope it lasts a long time.",5
This flat iron is amazing and smooth. It heats up super fast and leaves my hair silky smooth:) I love that it comes with a storage pouch and glove! Also the oil  that comes in the little bottle is great for adding shine to your hair. I am very happy with this flat iron and it was a great value.,5
"I've never tried a flat iron before but a friend of mine convinced me to use one. She used her Chi flat iron on my hair and I liked it but I didn't want to spend that kind of money so I looked on Amazon to find one. I came across the HSI and it works FABULOUSLY, just like all the reviews. I have dry, frizzy, curly, hair and I'm always afraid to damage it, but this flat iron makes my hair look and feel soft and silky! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a flat iron but not want to pay the high price. You will end up loving it.",5
"When I bought this straightener, I had originally searched for a replacement CHI (which I had for 5+ years), but this came up in the results. It was discounted like 80% off, which is usually a huge sign for me to stay away, but the reviews were amazing, so I took a chance and bought this instead. It's pretty good. I like the temperature control settings, and it feels very sturdy. However, for me personally, I feel that the CHI iron does a ""better"" job. Don't get me wrong; this iron will straighten your hair, but it takes me between 5-7 minutes longer, which, if you're just standing there waiting to finish your hair, is a little annoying. I also feel as if this iron takes longer to actually heat up, and to re-heat in the middle of straightening. For the huge difference in price, I'm not extremely disappointed I made this purchase, but I do miss my CHI.",4
"I am not sure what iron all these other reviewers received but my iron is cheap and worthless. I am returning it immediately. It snags my hair and it does not get anywhere near as hot as it needs to be. My hair was getting wavy 5 min after being ""ironed"". The worst buy ever. I really thought this was going to be a good buy according to all these ""great"" reviews. I must honestly say that I have bought a better hair iron at walgreens, and that is saying a lot. This thing is cheap junk. Don't even bother to consider this product. I have never ever written a review in my entire life and this product was SO disappointing I actually created a pen name just to write this review. I do not want anyone else to be as deceived as I was. I have thin, wavy, easy-to-manage hair and this was total and complete crap.",1
This flat iron was a complete wast of money.  The third time I plugged it in it was dead. I Tried the reset button etc.  Nothing. Expensive mistake.,1
"The reviews I read on this product were amazing. I got it quickly and it came as described. However, I wasn't 'wowed' with the quality. It is actually the same as my old one in straightening power that I got at Ross for $40. So, I was hoping for an upgrade and a really nice flat iron. Don't get me wrong, it works okay, but I've used much better. I have to go over my hair several times to get it to look nice which I was hoping I wouldn't have to do. But then again, it works well enough so that I don't need to return it. I just wasn't that impressed. I guess I got what I paid for. Just be cautious of reviews I suppose!",3
"I have thick curly/wavy hair and have been straightening it for 3 years now. I had a chi but it died so I searched on Amazon for a replacement and saw the good reviews for this one and ordered it. I'll probably keep this as a ""back up"" but need to order something better at holding it's heat because it takes so long to heat up and then after a pass through my hair it needs to heat up again. I section my hair when I iron it so it's not going through a ton of hair but it loses it's heat right away.Pros:In expensiveDoesn't snag my hair at all (my old Chi used to sometimes snag a strand of hair)Temperature controlCons:Does not maintain heatCools off too fastTakes a really long time to warm upIf you have thin-ish hair with a gentle wave, this may work for you but if you have thick wavy/curly hair this is not your best bet as it takes way too long to heat up and heat back up.",3
"I bought this flat iron because the reviews were so good.  However, it was not at all what I expected. I had to turn it to the highest heat setting to have it work at all on my my wavy hair.  It had a very rough feel, and it was almost as if my hair would get snagged on it with every use.  I prefer the Babyliss which feels nice and smooth and easy to use.",2
Works okay but not any better than one you can get at Walmart.  I have actually used cheaper ones from Walmart that I feel work better. Would not bother getting this brand again.,2
"I LOVE this flat iron. i was looking around for a CHI, but i saw too many imitations and bad reviews, so when i stumbled on this one and saw all the fantastic reviews i thought i would give it a shot. It showed up at my door 5 mins. ago and i tried it out right away. I have never been SO excited about a flat iron in my life. My hair is big, thick, half-wavy, half-curly, and a pain in the butt to straighten. I normally have to go over each 1 inch piece of hair at least 3 times to get it to be flat, and when i used the HSI today, it went over once and made my hair so flat and so incredibly shiny and healthy looking. I did not use any product, the flat iron did it on its on. Don't buy anything else, for 50 bucks, its the best purchase i ever made on amazon.",5
"This is a nice straightener and works better than most store bought straighteners. However, those that claim it is better than the Chi probably haven't used a real Chi. It gets very hot and works fast on my thick/curly hair, however it feels like it catches unless I use the oil product that it came with. When I use the oil it works like a dream!",4
This flat iron is wonderful! I've been using it almost every day for four months and it's performance is outstanding. I'd rate it right up there with the Chi iron my hairdresser uses. It heats up to HOT pretty quickly and keeps the heat coming. You can't beat it for the price!,5
"First let me say that I have not personally used this iron on my own hair as I still have one of the old CHI Turbo irons that I'm still very pleased with.  I purchased the HSI iron for my daughter for Christmas instead of wasting money on the CHI's of today which aren't very good as evidenced by the several that my daughter has gone through over the past couple of years.  The HSI, in my opinion, is on par and possibly even better than the old CHI irons and it's certainly better than the CHI irons made today.  My daughter has thick, very wavy hair and the HSI irons out the waves much faster than the CHI does.  Another thing noticed worth mentioning is that the CHI has trouble taking a ponytail bend out of hair, but the HSI handles that bend like a pro!  This iron gets very hot so you won't find yourself making multiple passes over the same chunk of hair as you must do with the cheaper irons that operate at lower temperatures.  The plates on this iron are very smooth which makes hair happy. My daughter has also informed me that she got great results ironing her hair after she let it dry naturally; that never happened with the CHI.  My daughter also received a CHI iron for Christmas in addition to the HSI I got her; she brought the CHI back.  While CHI may make much ""prettier"" irons, the CHI's of today just don't hold up.The HSI iron came with a protective glove to use while ironing your hair which I thought was pretty neat being I know I've gotten a little ""hot palmed"" when my iron cord got caught on a cabinet.  The HSI iron also came with some Argain Oil and my daughter reports that she likes it, but that's about all she has said regarding the oil.  Overall, this is a very good iron and I have recommended it to others that are looking for a good replacement for the CHI products.  Thank you HSI for making a great iron and thank you Blue Novelties for making this item available at a great price!",5
"You are never quite sure about the product quality or the service you'll get when buying on-line.  Confidence and great value is what I received with this product and seller.  I can already tell it is highly durable, perfect heat, great surface for the hair, and came with a few more amenities than mentioned in the add.  It also came sooner than promised.  Repeat business for this seller is a given.",5
"Ok... So I TRIED to wait until Christmas (it was a gift to myself, since my 2 teens kept borrowing my old one)... I FIRST used this for my famliy's Christmas party...smh....CRAZY!!!! MY HAIR FELT LIKE A BARBIE DOLL'S HAIR!! I DO NOT have bad hair (I am  AM) I take great care of my hait and just wanted my teens to leave me alone and didnt wanna share flt irons with them (im picky!!!)... So I got this on sale and OMG!!!!!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT and want other products by them!!!! IDK what to tell you... BUY IT!!!!! I was in the mirror smiling and COULD NOT believe the results...Last product I uses was the revlon ceramic and tourmaline and it was GREAT!!! This is like AMAZING!!!! and the OIL.... puleaaaaazzzzzz OMG.... JUST BUY THIS AND INVEST IN THE OIL!!!! PROMISE YOU!!!!! My sister, daughters and my youngest daugter friend felt my hair and all they did ws SHAKE THEIR HEAD (and I SMILED EACH & EVERY TIME!!!).... As I said i DO NOT have bad hair at all... This product is FIERCE!!!!!!!",5
"This straightener isn't all it's hyped up to be, it isn't better than my chi straightener.  and it CERTAINLY isn't a $200 straightener. I bought it when it was on sale for $60 luckily. But, is it better than a drug store straightener? probably.I returned this straightener for 2 main reasons: the first one is that I did notice some pulling when I ran the flat iron down my hair while straightening. With my chi it is perfectly smooth, there is no pulling AT ALLThe 2nd reason is that the plates don't evenly distribute heat because when the iron is clamped down the plates do not touch eachother uniformly. When I would clamp this straightener the bottom of the plates would be touching, but there would be a small gap between the top half of the plates.  This makes for uneven heat on your hair.  Again, with my chi this issue is non existent.This straightener is ok, but there is better quality available out there.",3
"The reviews led me to believe that I would be blown away with this straightener.  It's a good straightener, but I think I expected better.",3
"The Iron is pretty good, I feel like it snags my hair more than my last flat iron did. Also the iron is very heavy. You can adjust the heat which might be nice for some but I tend to need it turned all the way up all the time so I could have done without the dial. All in all not a bad flat iron. Good for the price",3
"This straightener really didn't work well for me as I have baby fine, thin hair.  I'm sure it would be much better on thicker hair.  I tried every heat setting but just couldn't get it to something that would deal with my hair.  I also have shorter hair and it's a bit bulky to me.",2
"After several years, my CHI died on me, so I bought this flat iron because of the many great reviews.  However, the HSI did not seem to get hot enough/maintain heat and it kept snagging my hair which is normally very easy to straighten.It was very simple to return and HSI refunded all of my money and that is why my rating is as high as it is.  I ended up going with the Cricket Friction Free Iron from Sally Beauty Supply which was actually $20 less and works even better than my $90 CHI did.  My sister is a stylist and recommended the Cricket to me.Also, the sample serum that it comes with is not Bio Silk as noted in the description, but HSI.  It also came with a glove and a satiny storage bag.",3
"This is an excellent product. It heats super fast and allows you to adjust the temperature. It leaves hair silky and smooth. I use it everyday and it has not damaged my hair at all. It leaves your hair very straight, even of it gets rained on or it is very humid. My old hair straightener left my hair frizzy and if it was the least bit humid my hair would flip in all weird ways but not with the HSI.",5
"I bought this because i saw all the great comments and ratings it had, but idk about it being soooo good like people say. Its okay in my opnion, its not good or bad. I wouldnt pay 50 dollars for this, I would pay 30 the most honestly! It leaves the hair parted when your trying to straighten it sometimes. But yeah i guess im keeping it...",3
"I bought this item as a gift for a professional stylist because of the comments. However, it heats up so much at the handle that it is not possible to finish without pausing. I was expecting to perform close like a CHI given the good reviews but there is no comparison this is a cheap product not for professionals.",3
"I had never heard of HSI before ordering, but I will definately buy any other hair tools that they make. The iron heats up quickly and has floating plates. My hair was very shiny after use, and I didn't need to use any sprays or sheens. With this flat iron, I can curl my hair, flip my hair, and of course straighten my hair. After use, my hair was bouncy and it looked almost as good as when I go to the hair salon. I will save a lots of $ now using this product rather then going to the salon! I love it!!!!",5
"My wife was not sure if she wanted this straightener or one called a chee. She liked the price of this one, and said it sounded like it was similar. After she bought it, she said it was great. She did say it did not get quite as hot as a chee, but that it worked great for her type of hair. (it's thick and really curly)",5
"This is a great straightner! I have coarse hair that is very broken, this tool helps my annoying little hairs flatten completly. Receved it two days after ordering. Would purchase again if needed.",5
"nice and smooth hair straightener... i don't like the plug as you need to reset sometimes. i've had others where you just plug and it goes. you might forget to do that and it's not heating up meanwhile you wasted time waiting. but other than that, it's great.",4
"Definitely glad this was on sale, because the original price was out of my budget.  It does the job wonderfully and puts my other $30 flat irons to shame.  Straightens hair in half the time my other irons did.  Heats up fast, too!  Comes in a great satin bag for storage and easy to pack for travel!  The switch inside the iron is in a perfect spot, other irons I used had the on/off switch near the handle and I'd accidentally turn it off sometimes.  Great product!  Highly recommended!",5
"I purchased this straightener for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  It heats up quickly and straightens much more effectively than her old iron, leaving her hair silky smooth.  When it stopped working she was heartbroken.  The customer service rep. was fantastic.  She took my complaint seriously and even included complimentary beauty products with the replacement iron.",5
Well I just received it and it said that I was suppose to get the argan oil but didn't receive any,3
"I love my iron, is the perfect size and in just few minutes I get my hair done!Just love it :)",5
"After 2.5 months of not much use - I probably only use it once or twice a week- the ceramic plate has cracked on the side and two big chips have fallen off of it.  Before that I was mostly happy with the straightener although I've used better for my very frizzy, naturally curly hair.",3
"I have never owned a nice flat iron- usually just buy a cheap one in store. I am in love with this flat iron. My hair is straighter than ever with this flat iron and it is actually staying straight unlike with my other flat irons. I am so excited to finally own a professional flat iron. I am thrilled with this flat iron, as well as the price.",5
"OK so I am not going to lie but I am basing my whole review off of only using this thing once because I just got it in the mail today! My hair is super thick, really curly/wavy and VERY frizzy! With my old flat iron it would take me over an hour to get it nice looking but with this one it only took me 15 MINS!!!!!! So I am very happy to say that not only did this thing save me a whole lot of time but it was able to tame the wild beast that I call hair! I will update this if I run into any issues but I don't think I will :)",5
"I had a professional grade flat iron for about 9 years and finally dropped it one too many times.  Had to replace it and was looking around and saw this on Amazon.  For the price, this flat iron is amazing!  Do I think it is the BEST product available?  No but again, for the price it is great.  I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair and this works well for me.  I think I would prefer a more definite temperature selection than the little wheel with no numbers on it but I always need the max anyway.If this lasts for two years then I will feel I got my  money's worth.  I would recommend this product if asked and especially at this low price :)",4
The seller is awesome and ships very quickly. The item is exactly as described by the seller. I only left 4 stars due to the product itself. I have only had it for a little bit and already the sides of the ceramic plates are chipping. Not very happy about that but again it is not the sellers fault. I cannot complain too much though as the price was pretty cheap for a decent hair straightener.,4
"Oh It was still in the box. The package was so small, I did not even see it! Thanks this is great, disregard last message!",5
"Works well for my fine hair, does grab hair sometimes but overall works great and leaves my hair straight for two days.",4
this flat iron was reasonably priced & does a fantastic job.  Very pleased with my purchase.  Make sure you give it plenty of time to heat up.  Would definitely recommend it.,5
Great price.  Great product.  This is the best flat iron I have owned.  Heats quickly and love the temperature control settings.,5
"Great product...great price! I was searching for a straightener for my teenager and she loves this...I have been using it, too!",5
Love this tool - does a great job and does not damage my hair!Why do I have to add more words???,5
It pulled my hair and the iron itself smelled like it was burning ....not even on the highest setting. I'm going to return it.,1
I have very curly kinky hair and for the price of this iron I was very hesitant in buying this but let me tell you this thing really works ! My hair was straight in an hour (Usual time it takes to straighten my hair is 2-3 hours) It wasn't stiff like other irons leave my hair and you can barely even see my split ends with the sample oil it came with loooovveee this lol,5
"I probably just got used to the way my old straightener curled but I think what makes the difference is that it doesn't open very wide.  I also don't like that there is no auto shut off or cool down, i get mini panic attacks throughout the day not remembering if i turned it offf.",3
"I was expecting the iron to do better than my generic one.  Unfortunately, there was not much difference.  It does get the job done though.",4
"So, this straightner is just okay, nothing really special about it. I really liked how they included the carrying case and the protective glove, that was nice. It might be just my hair type (i'm half puerto rican, half panamanian) and my hair type is thick and really wavy (not curly) but using this flat iron, it took multiple times going through that same piece of hair to get it straight. I like having to go only 2 or even 3 times, and that's it. I even used it at the highest setting, and it took at least 5 or more times to get it straight.It does straighten, but it takes too long to straighten my type of hair. It could be great for someone with thinner hair, naturally straight or slighty wavy hair. I think people with curlier, thicker hair should get a 2 inch flat iron, because 1 inch is not enough. I'm probably going to return this, and try to find a higher quality 2 inch iron.Also, another weird thing is after about 2 hours or so, I see my hair starting to get wavy again. I don't know if that has anything to do with the flat iron, again, it could just be the way my hair is. Give it a try if you have thinner, straighter hair.",3
In love I can't even brag about this enought I have super super thick curly hair and with one swipe STRAIGHT!!!! I'm off to vegas next week now I can hit the strip in style. I love it definently will buy other HSI products!! Works just as good as CHI if not better not to mention the price it's a steal. To top it all off when I opened the box they sent me one with an LCD display and free case to carry the iron!!!,5
"I am a professional stylist and I ordered this HSI FLAT IRON for work, not for personal use). I must say very very pleased for many years I have always used CHI however, within the last few years the chi tools have not  lived up to much. I made a chose to order this based on the reviews....and word of mouth not only I am I super happy with it the red little case it comes with is nice too. this iron is 20 times better then a chi. I did one side of my clients hair with the chi  the other with my new HSI flat iron.....I want everyone to know a BIG DIFERANCE I MEAN ((MY CHI IS ONLY 2 MONTHS OLD))  , I cut  my time in half . its hot on a professional level.my client even noticed. and co- workers. NOTE don't waste your time and money on a chi. HSI IS THE NEW THING........ HOPE THIS HELPS",5
"This was a great product and has worked amazingly. The price was amazing. I used to have to take my daughter to the saloon every couple of weeks to get her hair straightened, but this flat iron works great. I would defiently recommend this to everyone I know.",5
"This is a really great hair straightener.  It will straighten or curl, both with ease.  The end result is always sleek and shiny.  Couldn't be happier!",5
"I am a die hard Chi fan...until they changed it many years ago.  My very old Chi finally died and I replaced it with a new one.  It simply did not perform, which led me to start reading reviews on the HSI flat iron.  This little baby delivers!  I got the digital one which has automatic shut off, notifies in green when its reached the proper temperature and has a cute little smiley face :)  It heats up at mach speed and grips much tighter than the Chi which is essential for very straight hair.  If I had to choose one negative thing it would only be that it doesn't glide quite as smoothly as my other irons. That being said when its at 450 degrees it glides much smoother through my hair.  I have not had any issues with it pulling out hair or snagging nor does my light flicker.  Well worth the money I paid and I would purchase again.  I have wavy/wompy, thick hair and it does a fantastic job!",5
Hands down the best straightener I have ever used..heats up fast stays hot and works amazing for beach curls too better than a chi and cheaper,5
This  is the best straightener I have owned. It heats quickly. Takes my frizzy hair and makes it smooth. I love the electronic display and heat settings.  The automatic off is a great feature.  Especially since sometimes my girls forget to unplug or turn off. This was a great purchase. It's a professional product at a great price.,5
"I have a sedu brand flat iron that I have had for 4 Years and the cord now has a short in it.  I bought this HSI flat iron based on all the positive reviews.  Personally I don't like this iron and I still use the Sedu over this.  Reason.:  HSI pulls my hair. It is not smooth for my hair texture. I have medium fine hair fairly Straight with slight wave in it.  My daughter came over to use it and I asked her how she likes it and she doesn't , as it pulls her hair also.  Sorry I may have to give/or sell this and buy a different flat iron.",3
a high end iron for a low low price.  i have expensive irons but this one works the same. you just can't beat the price.  even if you have others it's worth having this one too.,5
I have found nothing wrong with this very affordable straightner. Best part about it- is that it does NOT catch stray hairs. That was a common problem I had in the past with other straigners- EVEN MY OLD CHI. Love the swivel cord. Only thing I say is look on the logo side- outside to see the tiny little red light that shines when it is on.... I couldnt find it to save my life the first week I had it. Finally I saw it very dimmly shinning. And it is VERY dim lol.,5
"the best flat iron i ever had, and i have thick hair and it presses it very straight, would recommend it to everyone.",5
Wonderful flat iron that works great and the price was awesome!  The shipping was fast and the product more than met my expectations.,5
"Fast shipping, competitive price and quality product.  My daughter loves this product and it has been easy to use and is perfect.",5
It works as advertised. I recommend you wait until you have points on your Amazon Visa to purchase it with though so that there will be no buyers remorse. I have extremely curly hair and it did great considering my lack of coordination in operating it. The only thing is they sent such a small sample of oil and I have so much hair its not really of any use.,5
When I straightened my hair with this product it worked very well. I got it in good timing. I received if about a week or so before arrival time. Very good purchase!,5
Very good product.  I like the fact that it comes with a glove and clear instruction guide for temperature gauge for various kinds of products.,5
"It heats up quickly, is easy to handle, and is slim enough to straighten, curl and flip. I use it mainly for straightening and for a light curl at the end. Doesn't take up much space on the bathroom counter and came with clear instructions on use. I'm glad with this purchase and plan to keep it! I returned the previous one which I had bought recently from Walmart as it wasn't as good as this one.",5
"I purchased this item after reading all the positive reviews about it. The price was a good price too. I received it in two days. The packaging was very secure and durable to keep it safe during delivery.  I used it the next day and it was greatttttt.....It worked just as good as the chi flat iron my daughter purchased for 150 bucks. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about buying them. I'll say to them"" go for it , you won't be disappointed"". Thanks again, Blue Novelties:)",5
"Before I had purchased this HSI flat iron, I was using a Conair that I had found for $15.  The Conair obviously wasn't getting hot enough to do my hair.  Spend the money & get a decent one.  I am well satisfied, & I was also very happy with how well the sample bottle of argan oil worked with it.  I recommend them both!",5
"I love, love, love this curling iron.  It smooths and shines my hair better than any flat iron that i've ever used.  A great purchase!!",5
"this was a gift for my wife and from her comments she loves it. it helps her do her hair a lot faster more secure, she doesn't have to worry about getting burn or being very cautious. i really recommend it on behalf of my wife. its really worth it.",5
I bought this after seeing a post on Facebook from my cousin.  Read the review's and decided to purchase. I have not been disappointed.  This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used!!,5
"I was interested in this iron because most of the reviews were good and the price was hard to beat.  The iron worked fine, it was a little slower to heat up, about a minute or so.  While the iron did a very good job of straightening my hair it did not glide as smoothly as I would like it to.",4
"Love the product, my hair looks silky smooth.  I always used a regular curling iron, this is fast and easy to use.",5
I love my new straightner.  It works so well that I carried it with me on a recent trip.....I would not put it in my luggage as I was afraid it would get lost.  I would definitely recommend it.,5
"It heats up fast, easy on your hair and very good quality flat iron. I like the travel bag it comes with.",5
"This product works great. It's fast, easy and reliable. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you for such a great product.",5
I absolutely love this straightener - it heats up incredibly fast and leaves my hair straight and silky.  This was the first straigtener I ever purchased and I use it religiously.,5
"This was purchased for my daughter who is a professional dancer and has to have her hair look perfect.  She absolutely loves it!  This equipment cost less than the one she previously used, and she raves about it.  From the controls to the little storage bag and the size of the plates.  She highly recommends it and so do I since it has made her so happy!",5
"I've never owned a flat iron I was in love with until I bought this one! After I decided to yet again attempt to find a flat iron that would not snag, cause more damage than needed, heat up quick, hold heat, and would allow my style to stay all day. Flat irons I've had in the past failed in one or more of these ways. My HSI flat iron exceeds my expectations and I don't find myself experiencing any of these typical negative attributes. I really could not be happier. I'm glad that I listened to the reviews and purchased the product for myself. I've paid triple what I paid this for really, bad flat irons in the past. My hair actually stays straight - this is probably the most important thing to me. Nothing more annoying than taking the weird wave out of my hair for it to come back an hour later. I love that the cord doesn't tangle since it is on a swivel. It heats up SUPER fast. I didn't think I could get such a good product for such a good price. Thank you for that!",5
Received this last week & my wife has been ecstatic using it. She loves the ease if use & it worked great for her hair. Appears to be high quality construction & feels good while using. Would recommend to others.,5
"Wonderful product.  No need for a wand and a curling iron...just use this straightner to do it all! Great value. Best straightner I've ever used! Fast shipping,  too!",5
"I gave it a 5 star because this product worked great on my hair took me 30mins perfectly straight I parted it in big chunks, I have thick curlly hair this straightner did magic I love it...",5
Purchased this thermal flat iron for professional use in a salon.  I have used it and found it to be very nice.  The company was prompt and courteous  and I would buy from them again should the need arise.,5
"I use this to straighten my hair often, but also use it to curl my hair. It is very safe on your hands, and does a fantastic job.",5
"I am African American, and I have relaxed hair. My hair is not thick nor is it thin, I would say it's somewhere in between. I have to say that I love this flat iron, it is by far the best I ever used. It gets really hot at the high setting, I am sure that it would work just as well on thick hair.",5
"I was looking for a new flat iron. I checked with my hair stylist on what brand I should get. After looking at this one and comparing it to what she recommend. The review's on this one where so amazing that I had to try it. I'm so glad I did!! I love how fast it heats up and make my unruly hair so shinny and nice. I would recommend this to anyone who's in the market for one. Its the best one I've ever bought, and you can't beat the price compared to some, Paul Mitchell, Chi, etc.",5
I love this hair straightener!!Works better than all of my other hair straighteners!It supper straightens my hair..it was worth the price..and fast shipping too : ),5
"I have been very pleased with this product! It works great & the price was great, too. I would highly recommend this.",5
"Bought for my daughter who flat irons all the time, this product is great, keeps up with her daily needs",5
I used HSI Professional 1 Ceramictournaline Ionic Flat iron once.  So far I like it. It glides smoothly on the hair.  I am looking forward to using it on a regular basis. I am giving a 4 star rating because I have not been able to use it much.,4
"After reading some very terrific reviews, I decided to give in and purchase this straightener.  At the end of the day, it is nothing professional but just a regular product.  I am definitely going back to purchasing my Chi that I have always depended on.",2
"Good hair straightener. Heats up fast, good quality, long cord, and at a good price. Would recommend and buy again myself!",5
"I've used many expensive ""salon"" flat irons that run in $100 range. While I love them, they never seem to last longer than 2-2.5 years. I decided to give the HSI a try. While it is not the best flat iron I've used, it's up there. It works well! I like the digital temperature display and auto shut off. For the price, it makes it an excellent deal. I hope it lasts longer than 2 years but if it doesn't, it is still a better value than my past flat irons.",5
It's an excellent straightener! It also curls really easily too. It heats up quickly and leaves your hair silky smooth!,5
"Worked like a wonder on my first try :)  Heats up super fast, worked exactly like I expected! Great deal for a fantastic flat iron!",5
There was one day it seem like it wouldn't turn on but it's I now.  I love it also it gets hot fast.,4
"i have thick, wavy hair,medium texture. This did not smooth and straighten as well as my previous one-Remington S8510DS Flat Iron, Frizz Therapy, 1 Inch. I had to make several passes and have the heat over 400.",3
I bought it as it has great discount. Only use twice so far. Will update my reviews later.a good product.,5
I bought this for my wife because she wanted another Chi and I wanted to save some money.  She absolutely loves it and will not be going back to the Chi.,5
"I got this as my first flat iron. I have thick, naturally curly hair and it took me about 15 minutes to straighten it. I had it set all the way up to the 450 degree setting, but it very quickly straightened each section on the first try. I am super happy this is the iron I got and did not spend the high dollars on a CHI or other much more expensive irons.I will update if anything goes wrong with it.",5
Does the job in 1/5 of the time as a reg flattening ironFairly inexpensiveHeats up to crazy hot but body stays coolNever have needed to use the included glovesBeautiful satin carry case for travel,5
"I find it a little difficult to use this but I think with a bit more practice, I will get there.  Wonder why there is such a gap between the ""arms"" - and that the on-off switch as well as the settings is between the arms, which makes it difficult too",4
"I have been looking for a decent hair straightener to buy and a friend recommended this one to me. When I first received it, it didn't look new, to be honest. I bought it new, but there were minor scratches as if someone used it before. I contacted Blue Novelties about it and they weren't able to exchange it, but did give me a $10 refund. Overall, it's a good straightener. I love how the strands of my hair does not get stuck in the straightener no matter how much hair I am straightening at once. I was also very happy with how kind their customer service were.",4
It would get 5 stars if my hair pulled through it as smooth as my old iron. Other than that I think it works very well.,4
"We ordered this to replace an aging Tool Science iron from Sally's. we are happy with its performance. Be mindful that it does not turn itself off. I have noticed that there are times when it will catch a hair or two... not a deal breaker. The one I purchased from Amazon had a Bonus sample of Argan Oil with it. Was disappointed to find a little foil packet only instead of the little bottle they showed in the listing. None the less, the oil works AMAZING!!! So much so, we went and purchased the oil separately. My daughters hair feels and looks like those on the TV commercials now. It has to be the oil. Don't skip buying it.",5
I really like this straightner. It works well on my curly hair. I have used straighteners in the past but none have worked as well as this one. It takes me no time at all to flat iron my hair. I use the glove with it to keep from burning my hand while straightening.,5
Thought that a more expensive flat iron would glide through my hair and make it shinier and more healthy looking.  It does about the same as the ones I pay $25.  This is no fault of the vendor.,3
"I like it, because I have tons of hair, and curly, so it has always been a problem to have it straight, I had some other product similar but did not work very well it took me ours to do it and I was not very happy with the results. I try this as soon as I got it, and I really think it has been one of my best purchases ever, I was able to straighten my hair in no time and it was shinning, well I love it and I will recommended to everyone I know.",5
Fantastic flat iron!  Love it so much that I bought one for my daughter and my best friend bought one as well!,5
"I LOVE this flat iron! Heats up quickly, you can adjust the heat setting, long cord, and 1/3 of the price that the salon wanted. Professional quality for sure and using the HSI Argan Oil leaves your hair shiny, soft and no frizz looks like you walked right out of salon. You will not be disappointed, I am not :)",5
"this is by far the best flat iron  I have owned, only suggestion for manufacturer would be to put the on/off & heat setting on outsixe of product rather on inside, other than that works great",5
"The HSI flat iron is really nice, it works just as well as the more high end brands at a great price.",5
I love the flat iron. Can you say amazing. I recommend this flat iron to everyone with all different hair textures.,5
"I love this flat iron. It heats up quick, has a solidly constructed hinge, a wide range of heat settings. It works like a charm and I couldn't be more satisfied.",5
"I have never used a flat iron before, so I asked my granddaughters for advice. Following their suggestions I picked the HSI Professional Ionic Flat Iron.  I have thick, coarse, curly hair and I love the way it looks and feels after I use my HSI Professional flat iron. This is a great product and I will recommend it to my friends.",5
"Before I purchased the HSI, I was using a SEDU flat iron, it cost $160.00. HSI is exactly the same quality for $40.00, same feel, weight, quality and performance.",5
Excellent...Fine productHSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENERPower Balance Performance Technology Bracelet in (Black/White Lettering),5
"Good flatiron ~ love the sachet that comes with it, use this all the time for traveling...recommend to anyone . I also have fine hair ; works great",5
"The flat iron works amazingly. I'm super happy with it!! I got flat iron on time and it was well packed. And the company have been in contact with me with I love. Great buy, I'm really happy!",5
I always bought my daughter the her styler iron n was gona that day but than I seen this one n thought I would give it a shot well that was the best thing I did cause my daughter loves it even better than the her styler it made her hair straight n shiny price was great n it was really quick delivery it was money well spent,5
This is a great product and is exactly as described. It has a control for the heat setting.  I love it!,5
"I didn't want to spend another $200 to replace my Chi, and after reading all the reviews here, I gave the HSI a try.  It's fantastic.  Every bit as effective as the Chi, at a fraction of the price.  In fact, I like the HSI better because you can control the temperature and the swivel cord is better quality than the Chi.  As a bonus, it comes with a travel bag, a travel size sample of argon oil, and a glove to protect from burns.  Excellent product.",5
"I had used a GHD straightener for years before it finally died on me. Since I didn't feel like spending the big bucks, I decided to buy this one. I have been using the HSI straightener now for over a year and it is holding up better than expensive ones I have owned. I straighten my hair every day and have been for years now. This straightener definitely holds up to my high standards! And you know what? If it only lasts a few years, I won't feel bad buying another one.",5
I bought this for my daughter for christmas in 2012 and 6 months later bought myself one since she wouldn't share it. I love it. It works well and does a good job.,5
"That's good for Asian hair! It lets my hair be straight, and very sweet with a glove in the box.",4
I like this flat iron its sturdy and comes with a sample light weight oil and has the ability to dial up or down the temp. Gives great shine and it lasts for days.,5
"I may have gotten the bad batch of this product because when I got it, there was a slight crack on the handle and the cord easily detaches, in which I think its not suppose to be detachable. It occasionally turns off by itself for some reason. Plus its too expensive for me.",3
"I've change from having a $30 straightener that I am use to buying. I wasnt comfortable because I didn't know the product very well, but after reading several reviews on how great it works, and has being the best selling straightener, I went ahead to buy it. I got it in Three days and I would have purchase it earlier on if I had known of the product. When I apply the straightener its made my hair look amazing and my friends were admiring it. It definitely worth its purchase price. It heats up within minutes so you can get it done quickly. And the little bottle of argon oil it comes with makes your hair really soft. You need to see how it leaves my hair shiny and smoothes the ends without leaving them rough and dry. Totally worth every penny!",5
I have been looking for a good flat iron that really makes my hair not look so fried. I really like this flat iron. My hair looks shiny and my ends look great. Very smooth one time passing. I did my research and this had great ratings. I am glad that I purchased this one!,4
"I love my hair straightener, I don't use it very often since my hair is straight naturally but when I do it works great, especially when I curl  my hair.",5
Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who is a hair stylist and she loves it. Says it works better then a lot of her big name brand irons that she spent 3x as much on! She is very happy with the quality and performance.,5
My hair feels great! This product has a professional quality and works great. I love the shine to my hair.,5
I have curly hair and this worked really well! I used this when traveling abroad across multiple countries in Europe. It worked great with a voltage adapter.,4
I loved the HSI flat iron.  I bought the cheapest one and my only frustration is that it doesn't turn off if I accidentally leave it on.  So if I did it again... I would step up to the high bracket.,5
"I absolutely love this flat iron.  I had one that I like but wanted a ""better"" one. This flat iron is amazing!  I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and this works WONDERS on my hair.  They send a little sample of oil with this product and I ended up buying a BIG bottle of it.  You cannot go wrong with this flat iron!``",5
"I have always bought flat irons in the $30 range. I have very thick wavy hair, and the cheaper irons just weren't cutting it. I started researching and had pretty much decided to buy a CHI. I found this on Amazon (when I got it, it was $38) and am SO GLAD I did. It is a MUCH better product than any other I've used. My hair gets flatter and less staticky.There is also a swivel where the cord meets the iron, so I find it easier to do different angles without the cord getting caught in my hair or in my face. Highly recommend!",5
"I purchased this product because I needed a 220 V for travel outside of the United States.  Since the product is 110/220 V I can also use it in the US.  I've used it several times and it does a great job on my thick, slightly wavy hair.  The price is exceptional!",5
"I broke my first one because I was being clumsy.  I bought it again and haven't had any problems with it. I like that it comes with a protective case for traveling, which you can put inside even though it has not completely cooled yet.  I also like that it comes with a small sample jar of argan oil for you hair!  I bought this also for my brother's gf as an xmas gift",5
"I think this flat iron pulls on my hair and is not as smooth as the flat iron I replaced. But considering the price, it does an okay job. I like that I can set the temperature of the flat iron, I have pretty straight hair already so I don't need to fry my hair to get it straight.",3
"Love how hot this gets, love the digital display, and love the results. Only complaint is that you really have to cram down on the handles to get a tight squeeze. Wish the flat iron plates were just a bit more perfectly parallel to one another.",4
I love this flat iron. I wish that I would have found it long before I wasted a lot of money on my Chi. The only thing that I don't LOVE about it is that the controls are on the inside and the indicator light is on the outside (rather than some flat irons have controls and indicator light on the side so that you don't have to move it to adjust if it's on).,5
I bought the chi flatiron but when I was reading reviews to try hsi flatiron I decided I would. You won't be disappointed it works just the same as the chi ! I love it!,5
"i really have nothing to complain about, really, works well as I expected. I use it for straightening or curling and they last forever!",5
"After my last trip to India, where my flat iron caught on fire even with the voltage adaptor and plug adaptor, I decided to order this iron with hopes that neither my iron nor my hair would catch on fire.  Neither caught on fire and the iron worked really well.",5
"I had a CHI but can't find it online anymore. Perhaps the company got bought out??This straightener is good, but not great.I definitely need to use an oil or hair serum to make my hair smooth.(I have wavy dirty blonde hair, not too thick, not too thin)And when I am straightening my hair with this straightener, I feel like it pulls some hair out.  It is not a smooth-feeling process. Pulls and tears a bit. So I eased up on my grip, and of course it doesn't pull as much...but then I have to re-do each chunk of hair.",3
"There wasn't enough Argan oil to rate that and I don't use the glove, however the straightener works great! Without the heat even turned up all the way, it straightens my hair in just a couple passes. My hair is semi curly-wavy. For extremely curly hair, I imagine it might take 3-4 passes, maybe less if the heat is turned up. I wanted something reasonably priced that would straighten my hair in just a couple passes and that's exactly what I got.",5
"Fantastic flat iron, low price.  Was very lucky to find!  Would suggest this product to anyone that loves flat ironed hair.",5
"I recently purchased this straightener to replace one that I had used for years.  I was hesitant because it wasn't the brand that I normally use.  It had come up as a deal of the day so I checked it out.  The price was amazing so I decided I would try it.  It arrived quickly, and with a sample of the HSI argon oil.  It has a temperature control which is great for different types of hair. It works quickly and leaves my hair very smooth and soft!  I would definitely do business with this seller again!!!!",5
"After the cord broke on my $100+ straightener, I had been converted to the importance of a high quality straightener but had a hard time stomaching the price of another. I took a chance on this and I'm glad I did. It performs as well as my old model and this one even has a temperature control (my old one didn't). No complaints here! The price is right and it works!",5
"I am very impress with the results of this product . I use to be a chi girl but not anymore ! this  product really does what it said , my hair is so silky and soft I love the way it feels,. just unbelievable  I recommend this product yes for all types of hair  . love it love it.",5
"My wife loves this flat iron, and when I asked her what she would rate it out of 5 stars, she said 5.",5
"I had one that I bought at the mall and gave it to my sister so I got me this one to replace, I completly love it... Half the price for one even better... Cool fixture its that it turns off after some time when you forget is on. Happend to me once and I was really glad when I went and check. Highly recomended!",5
Love it the price is amazing the iron works great the pouch was super cool. The glove. But the only thing i didn't like it's that the argan oil is not a travel size is a sample.,4
I ordered this flat iron because of the great price and great reviews it got. I certainly was not disappointed. It straightens my hair and works the same as the more expensive flat irons I have bought.The shipping was quick as well.,5
Great flat iron for the price and speedy delivery. I love that it has a really long cord and heats up in under 3 minutes. Downfall is that you can't control the heat- it's just either on or off. But it straightens my hair well as is.,5
"Very happy with this.  I've never owned one before, but it heats up faster than my curling iron and I love that it tells me when it's ready.  I also like the dial to have it hotter or cooler.  The glove is a great idea because it keeps me from burning the hand holding the hair.",5
"I love the fact that I can control the settings and the screen is easy to see/read.  So far, the best flat iron I have had!",5
Lightweight and easy to use.  Purchased this with a very good Argan Oil and have been so happy with the results.,5
I love how it works. It is a great flat iron and for the price you can't beat it for anything.,5
Made my wife happy.Unit works fine and hoping it lasts longer than the other brands she has worn out,5
"I've always been disappointed with flat irons - taking way too long to work. I just don't have the time nor the patience. For the price this one is terrific! Heats up quickly, does it's job quickly, and now I never go out without using it.",5
I'm glad I read the other positive reviews which is what convinced me to purchase this!!  Heats up quick and works great!!  Great packaging also!!,5
"This product is wonderful! Better than expected. As soon as I got it I tried it, WOW its wonderful :) You will not be disappointed. It also arrived in ONLY 2 days :)",5
"My old flat iron seemed to slowly be dieing, so I wanted to get a new one without breaking the piggy bank.  So far i have been pleased with the results from this one.  It heats up quickly and does a good job straightening my hair.  The on and off switch and temperature controls are a little awkward to reach on the inside of the iron, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  How it stands up over the long haul remains to be seen, but so far, so good.",4
Item came earlier than expected. It's brand new and comes with a glove a oil to try out. Works amazing!,5
"I gave this item 5 stars because the transaction was perfect. It arrived early, it works perfectly and I would recommend this flat iron to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and well built accessory. Couldn't recommend more highly!",5
"Not as terrific as my original one that I ordered from Amazon but I left that one at my daughter's house for when I visit and then got this replacement. The temperature needed is about 380 degrees for fine hair. It works smoothly to straighten hair. I take it to the gym with me in the box because I don't want the cord to get injured lugging it with all my other paraphernalia. It has a little satin cover but I could not fit in the flat iron with the cord into the the cover. It does have an extra long cord but my outlets are close by so that was not a necessity. For the price, it is fine and the ceramic plates are very smooth. That part is good. The low heat of 140 is of no use but around 380 worked. I recommend it but love my original best. I don't know what that one is called because it's not at home here to check. I will modify my review when I find out,",4
I love how you can choose the heat settings according to your hair type. This flat iron straightens the hair beautifully.,5
Tried less expensive brands and that's exactly what you get. This HSI professional ceramic flat iron straightened my thick coarse hair so fast I couldn't believe it was done. Had to look twice to make sure. Great product and packaging!,5
I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!! I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH STRAIGHT HAIR:) THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT!,5
"I chose this rating because in order to get my fine hair to do anything at all, I had to turn the heat up to 400. Also, I have not been able to clean the product of the surface of the ceramic.  I have tried the warm water on a still warm iron per the instructions but it does not remove the product i.e., hair spray, etc.  I also used a cotton ball with a little alcohol on the warm plates but still could not remove the product.  Seems there is not a good solution to keeping the ceramic plates clean.  In that case, it won't last long before I have to replace it.",3
"Love the brand, its a wonderful item and at a great price. If you are looking for a great flat iron go for the HSI product you won't be disappointed.",5
The best flat iron by far. Better than chi. This is my second one. The last one I had for 3 years and it fell and plates broke.,5
"Compared to my last straightener, this one is smooth sailing! It doesn't feel like it's pulling or tugging at my hair!",5
"Fast and easy to use, I do my hair only in 15 minutes, is easy to handle, i liked that came with a glove to protect me.",5
"I ordered this product for my kinky curly hair and it smoothed it out like butter to a warm knife. It heats up fast and the LCD indicator is very helpful. The flat iron has an auto shut off feature that can be helpful for those forgetful days but worrisome during the styling process. Overall, I'm loving the product and I hope it stays around for some years to come.",5
"Well this iron is as described.  Seems like good quality. Doesnt catch and pull hair out. Have had for a month now so all is well.The other reviews said it worked as well as the Chi iron.  I dissagree.  My CHi was better, but i have had too many issues with my Chi's.  Thats why i was willing to try somthing else.  Glad I didn't spend too much money on this or I would have sent it back.It doesnt straighten my hair like a Chi.  It takes much longer than I usually would take.  Eventually I'll be buying another style of straightener but for now ill use it.Note: Im caucasian and I have thick, slightly natural curl hair that loves a 450 degree temp straightener.  So if your hair  is like mine think about it some more.  If you dont have a problem straightening your hair, this iron will work great.",4
Love this HSI flat iron! My first HSI product and I couldn't rate it high enough! It's super fast and really easily straightens and smooths my very fine already straight but sometimes fly away hair. Can't go wrong with this one! Grab it up!!,5
This is my new favorite flat iron. I bought it not knowing much about the brand but I absolutely love it. The best one I have ever owned and it works miracles on my hair in which I thought I would never be able to get completely straight! The price I was able to get it for was amazing and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fabulous straightener for a fabulous price!,5
"I bought this for my granddaughter since the one she had was really not meeting her needs. She's 14, so not real big on elaborate conversations, but when I asked if she liked it she said she did & she uses it just about everyday.",5
Just as described and works great. I love it.I originally planned on buying a Chi but happy I got this one instead.Fantastic and cheaper,5
I Love this straightner. Heats up fast does a great job. Use it every other day. Love the glove too that comes with but it isnt heat resistant but it does protect your hand to a degree.,5
"I loved this product. I have very thick hair that usually takes me about 1-1.5 hours to straighten , but after using this straightener it takes less time and comes out great. ive always had problems with hair feeling brittle, but that was not the case with the HSI. I ended up buying two, one for myself, and after my aunt heard how much i loved it, i bought her one too....overall great product and it was way worth buying",5
I remember when I was young and my mother would use the regular old iron heated up on the stove and then put my head on the counter and straighten my hair.I LOVE having a so much better way to straighten (or curl) my hair now.... could not curl it with the iron back then...lolThe price was good too.,5
"this was a great product at an even greater price. So far, this flat iron has not burned my hair and it leaves my hair bouncy and shiny. Hope it last a long time!",5
"I am very happy with my new HSI Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  It heats up very quickly and glides easily through my hair.  I have extremely curly hair and this product straightens it out within minutes.  It only take a few minutes for me to go from curly to beautiful straight, shiny hair.  I bought this because I needed wider plates than the iron I was using.  These plates are 1"" wide vs my previous iron which was 1/2"" wide.  This iron is much easier to use and goes much faster.  I have not had any problems at all with it....I love it!",5
I purchased this flat iron to replace a much more expensive one.  This one works as well as the higher priced one.  Great iron for the money.,5
"My hair loves this product! Super straight hair with minimal work! My old straightener left me with frizziness and fly-aways! It is amazing the difference a good, ceramic straightener makes!",5
hi i just received my order yesterday and i was suppose to receive a small bottle as a simple of argan oil i did not can u tell me plz why i didnt receive it becuase all the videos  i was watching on youtube people saying they receive argan oil hope i hear from you soon thanks.,3
"This product does exactly what I expected it to do, expecially with my daughters hair being very natural in texture. I would recommend this product to everyone.",5
"This is by far the best hair straightener that I have ever used. It works quickly and flawlessly. To make it even better, this product came with a heat glove and oil which is awesome. It came quick and right on time. To top it all off, it is priced so well. I'm so surprised this isn't worth hundreds. I'm so happy that I bought it.",5
"Love this flat iron!  I ordered one for my daughter.  After seeing how well it works, I ordered one for myself!",5
"The product works exactly as I had hoped.  Mostly using it to straighten/fix wrinkled collars for dress shirts, but the girlfriend has used it a few times on her hair as well, and was very happy w/ the results.",5
"I love my new flat iron! It is just the right size to do my bangs perfectly. And, I can set the temperature so it's perfect for my hair type. When I shopped for a new flat iron, most that I found that had all the features I wanted were at least $99. The HSI ionic flat iron is wonderful! My hair is wavy and difficult to manage in humid weather. But, not any more! My hair is smooth and beautiful when I use my new flat iron each morning. I would recommend this product to the people I love most!",5
"After being disappointed by my other flat irons over the years I decided to finally try this one after reading about it being one of the best and very affordable. I am biracial (Black and latina). I relax my curly hair every two months. I also do lots of cardio so tons of sweat. My old flat irons would straighten my hair but as soon as I would walk outside my hair would revert back to being frizzy and then I would have to flat iron again. With this flat iron my hair STAYS STRAIGHT the whole day. There is no need for me to flat iron again, unless i go to the gym. My hair looks amazing! I can't find any frizz anywhere and I've been outside and everything. I highly recommend this product. The only problem that I have with this flat iron is the fact that it has a on/off switch that you have to move. I prefer the kind that has the automatic shut off just in case you forget it's on. Thankfully I always remember to turn it off but it would be nice to have a automatic shut off feature.",5
I really like this straightener and the price is good. You can also curl your hair with it. The only thing I'm not crazy about is that it seems to snag my hair sometimes.,4
Loved it!  Works wonderful and is light and user friendly. I highly recommend! It's great to have little case to keep it in too.,5
This is the best flat iron I have ever used it works amazing on my very fine and thin hair it's  so much better than this 200-300$ flat irons,5
"this is a fabulous product. I love it. however,  I do have a little trouble curling but other than that it's great",4
"I am a professional hair stylist,I have worked with several high end flat irons.I would recommend this one to be just as good and the pricing evan better.You do have to break them in to get the reaction your looking for.",4
This is a great tool for my hair and very good price. The argan oil is awesome too. Works on my short hair!,5
"I recently purchased this product and have used it several times and am pleased with the results on my naturally frizzy course hair.  This is a high quality straightener for the price, I would recommend it for those wanting a good straightener without wanting to spend a lot of money.",4
My daughter wanted this flat iron for her birthday.  I decided to also to buy one for myself.  My daughter has long thick hair and I have short senior hair. We have both been please with the results of our hair after using the HSI Professional flat iron.  The HSI Professional 1 flat iron is definitely worth the price it compares with much higher priced flat irons on the market. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.,4
This is a high quality flat iron for an amazing price.  The plates are super smooth and don't pull the hair at all and 1 inch is perfect for straightening or curling.  Iron heats up fast and 360 degree cord is keeps from tangling.  Will purchase HSI products again.,5
"I needed a new flat iron after my old one started losing it's spring tension and it was taking more and more time to straighten each section of my hair. I decided to try this brand after reading so many positive reviews. It works great on my coarse wavy hair. I probably should have gone with a thinner straightener since my hair is only shoulder length, but the 1 inch still does the job. I like fact that I can set the temperature and it heats up really fast. The only negative is the buttons are hard to read and operate. Once you remember the function of each button it's not as much of a problem. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and the low price and fast shipping were a plus!",4
"I have been using a Chi for a couple years and when it broke I purchased this item. I have to say that so far I think it works better! And it is much more affordable! I use my flat irons a lot (4-5 times a week) so I will track to see how long this one will last, but so far so good!",5
"It's an excellent product and heats very fast. For the price, it is good compared to high end straighteners. The only problem is that the roundness of the flat iron makes it hard to straighten shorter hair unlike the chi straighter ftat.",5
"Got this for my sister's birthday, she loves it. Heats up so amazingly fast, it's unbelievable. She's really enjoying this. Thanks.",5
"My previous T3 iron broke since the spring popped off and the screw in plain sight was loose if I remember correctly.This iron doesn't have that problem at all, the build is very sturdy and the feature that surprised me the most is the amount of time it takes to heat up which is not at lot! It makes iron time extremely quick combined with the smoothness of the plates. However the sturdiness can also take a toll on my hands since it can get a little heavy continually pressing down on the iron.The argan oil sample is also lovely, it's good enough for around 5-10 uses depending on your length.",5
Love this iron . Great price . Works well lots of heat settings so does not burn my hair. Great value,5
"After reading all the reviews, I decided to get this flat iron.  My previous one lasted for over 10 years and I was bummed when it finally died.  Given the price, I think it's really excellent and works well.  My only, slight complaint would be that it's kind of awkward trying to adjust the temperature knob-it's hard to see and get to with your fingers.  It can be done, it's just sort of in an awkward spot on the device.",4
Helps control the fizzies but doesn't burn hair....the temperature setting is quite accurate. I only wish the little red light that shows that you left it on were a bit bigger and easier to spot.,5
"I wanted a hair straightener. I demand a high quality product but not a premium price. Fortunately for me I did not need to read through a thousand reviews:  I am the mother of a teenage girl with naturally curly hair who spends an insane amount of time de-curling, de-frizzing her hair 6 times a week. She recommended this product to me! It couldn't get a higher recommendation even from a prof hair stylist. I am the person who gave her the curl gene (!) and so yes, I do have wavy hair that looks unruly in humidity. This is a great product that is easy to use. I love the temperature settings as I do not wish to fry my hair into a straight look. It soothes the outer layer of the hair making it appear manageable and healthy. It is very light weight which I like as its easy to pop in a suitcase when travelling. I have only one complaint and it is minor - they supply a sleeve to keep it in and the sleeve is so narrow that you cant fit the hair straightener and its plug in there at same time - minor!",5
We got one for my Grand daughter and then my wife needed one. They both use it and like it.,5
"Actually went through the reviews and researched this product and love it. Great! Prompt, safely packaged. Works great on thick, curly or kinky long hair and especially with the argan hair treatment too.",5
This straightener works fantastic. The plates heat up so quickly and the cord does not get tangled. The results on my wife's hair are amazing. She has a lot of wavy hair and after using it first try her hair was straight!!!!,5
"I just love my new flat ceramic iron. This was the easiest, most quickest and cheapest transaction I have ever made on AMAZON. The seller is prompt and promising with quality.For the price I paid I'm really happy and satisfied with this purchase compared to the other expensive flat irons in the market. I would most likely recommend this product to friends and family!!!!!",5
"My hairdresser recommended this product and I love it. Heats quickly, very easy to use and styling results are great. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Highly recommend the flat iron and the vendor.",5
I chose this rating because it was a great product. Not quite as nice as a top brand straightener but it gets the job done.,4
Product was just as described. High quality.  Works great.  I would recommend this to anyone.  professional style flat iron for home use.,5
This flat iron met all my expectations. I appreciate the adjustable heat dial and it leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.,5
I bought this for my girlfriend and was convinced to purchase it after reading other reviews that it was just as good as a CHI or better for some. So far she has used it several times and has said it is comparable to the CHI and heats up very fast and straightens her hair really nicely. I love that its half the price of a CHI but so far has done the same job.,5
"I am an African American woman who has chosen to go natural. No relaxers. I have tried a number of different irons, but this one is by far the best. Easy hold. Not too hot in my hand. Great on my roots. Led notification prevents scorching, and the PRICE!!!! The price is just right! SCORE!!!! CHI no more!",5
"Straighter is very nice. Heats up quickly, and works great. Item gets a little hot on the handle but otherwise no complaints.",5
Better than a chi or anything else on the market.the price makes it better.I'm a natural aa with thick curly hair n it gives me that relaxer straight.,5
"I have been using this flat iron for a few months.  I am transitioning to natural hair which means I  try not to use too much heat on my strands. I do not want to do any damage to my hair,, The HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC is really a professional flat iron.  I know some say they are and you spend hundreds of dollars on it just to be disappointed in the quality. NO DISAPPOINTMENT HERE, I love that I can set how hot or cool you want it. I just use my HSI on my new growth, just 2 or 3 glides and down to the ends I go... I have used it to curls my ends also and it really did a great job.. I love how it is packaged with its own red silk sleeve and a glove if you need it. My daughter bought one of the high end flat irons (no name mentioned) but it was over $100.00, She tried my HSI and to her excitement she loved it. She said that it was just as good or better than hers,,,, WOW  The price is affordable and it works like a dream...YES I recommend the HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON ... I love it and am so glad I purchased it....God bless and happy flat ironing,, lol",5
"With this, I can straighten and curl my hair easily, and it only takes like less than 30 seconds to heat up. Very convenient  too , light (can be used in different countries) highly recommended!!!!",5
"I bought this straightener because of the ratings it has received. I have had the straightener for almost a year, and it still works but it often shows that it is still heating (red light) when it has been heating for more than long enough switching from red to green lights constantly. It also doesn't get as hot as it used to at lower settings so I have to periodically increase the heat more and more. I will not be buying a HSI straightener for my next purchase because it doesn't seem to be able to hold the heat.",3
I have used a Chi for years and I was ready for a change.  This flat iron is as good if not better for my hair.  I love the way it is designed.,5
"I.S.O. Professional is cheaper and great. I've been using same one for 2+ years and love it, thought I would try out something new. Really regret it. I tried to straighten my hair with this... It did not straighten it. It may have made it less curly but still wavy, and also ripped out my hair. I returned it next day.Anyone looking for a new straightener should try the I.S.O. professional. It is cheaper and works fantastic!",1
"We like this flat iron because with the rounded edges we can add some under curl when using it, and it has held up well",5
With so many positive reviews I was hoping it was all they said it was but unfortunatly it wasn't for me.. doesn't glide smoothly and tugs at my hair....wish it worked for me but it just didn't:(,1
I received this item today and it never turned on. I tried resetting it and it didn't work. hopefully customer service is able to solve something for me,1
Works really well with my coarse Asian hair. Comes with a tiny satchet of Moroccan argan oil and a heat resistant glove.,4
"I recently decided to purchase this HSI straightener with a sample of Argan Oil after reading the numerous positive reviews.  I've only used this tool a few times, but have been very impressed with the results.  The unit heats up very quickly and leaves my hair smooth and silky within minutes.  If you are looking for an inexpensive Flat Iron that leaves professional looking results, I would definitely recommend this tool.",4
Got this for a gift and the recipient was surprised and delighted as she'd been wanting one.  Felt good to give a gift that was so well received.,5
"I bought two of these for 2 of my granddaughters for Christmas.  They both wanted them because of them has a cousin that has one.  My granddaughters are age 14.  They love these and are easy for them to use by themselves.  I know I got it at an excellent price through Amazon, because if you price this EXACT same brand at other stores, the price is MUCH higher.  Glad I bought this and glad I bought it through Amazon.",5
This iron gives the exact results of the more expensive $100 irons for a better prices.  I purchased the older model and the heat control is just a knob and not a digital readout.,5
I ordered my HSI flat iron not too long ago. The one I received was defective. I finally found time to actually email Blue Novelties regarding it. The light would not stay on it kept blinking off/on and when I move the wire it would turn on only to turn off again. Needless to say the customer service at Blue Novelties responded back promptly and I received the new/used HSI flat iron the next few days. I am happy with my new flat iron. Kudos guys.,3
I love this flat iron!!  It heats up so fast and does the job. I also like the auto shut off function for peace of mind!!  Would purchase again!!,5
"Love the way it makes my hair sleek, and smooth. It removes all friz, which i love.... The iron is solid and has the feel of a professional styling wand, just as described. The long cord comes in handy a lot. Overall a great product that i would recommend for people who enjoy styling their hair.",5
Terrible flatiron if you have coarse hair! This flatiron does not get hot enough to be effective. This is terrible! I'm returning it for a refund.,1
This is a great product. The iron heats fast and leaves your hair silky soft. I don't know how I got along without it.,5
Shipping was Great and I Love the Flat iron!!! Works really well and heats up fast. Love the Argan Oil too.,5
First time buying an iron and this brand was recommended to us by a stylist friend! It works great on our hair and is easy to use. Very satisfied with product. Thanks,5
This flat iron is one of the better irons I have used.  I have naturally curly (frizzy) hair and live in a humid climate and I get professional results when using the HSI flat iron.  The only drawback for me is that it does not have auto shutoff.  I would recommend this product to anyone.,5
"This definitely gets the job done and I love the carrying case. It does, however, sometimes rip my hair, and the red light stays on for long periods of time and I'm not sure why.",4
"Well I bougtht this flat iron because my CHI finally died on me.  I decided to try a new flat iron even though I had really liked my CHI.  I looked into quite a few different brands but when looking at the reviews for this flat iron I decided to give it a try. Plus the price was a huge selling point. I have naturally curly, frizzy, and unruley hair but I was pleasantly surprised when I finally tried it out.  It does a great job with just one pass on my hair which is saying a lot.  I am very happy with my purchase. It heats up quickly, has easy temperature control, on/off switch. I really don't have any complaints.",5
"I think this is just like other ordinary straighter.  I bought it because of a lot of great reviews but after using it, I don't feel like this is as amazing like other reviews said..",3
I really like the flat iron and love the price.  It doesn't fry my hair like my last one.  Would highly recommend this flat iron,5
"I am pleased with how this flat iron performs so far. It heats up fast, is hot enough to straighten my curly hair, and is easy to use. My only request would be that they include a stand so you can set it down without worrying about surface damage, especially when it's cooling after use and before putting it away.",4
"I bought this for my significant other and she loves it. I don't know if its because she's been using cheaper models in the past, but I do know that one of her brands that broke was a ""Chi"".  Every since she received this one, she's been washing her hair more and more just to use the flat iron. She really loves how it straightens her hair with one pass instead of several passes from other models. I would highly recommend the flat iron.",5
I bought this for my wife and she was absolutely thrilled when It arrived. great value for a quality flat iron!,5
"This flat is great.  I have relaxed hair, but I'm transitioning to natural hair.  Half of my hair shaft is natural.  This straightened my natural hair nicely and if you use the oil, the iron really seals the hair shaft.  I tried curling my hair and the curls were beautiful.  I use two passes on my natural hair and one pass when reach the portion of the shaft that is still relaxed. I use a medium heat setting and it works well for me.",5
"The straightner WILL NOT stay hot, and it takes a while to heat up... once its hot it does a good job but, you have to keep setting it down to let it heat back up...  not great but, the price isn't bad.",3
It works well but in my experience not to the extreme that others claim. Does The job quickly which is nice,3
I previously owned a Chi flat iron and needed a new flat iron due to minenot working anymore.  I LOVE my HSI! I read about the great reviews onAmazon before I bought it and am so very happy with the HSI!!!It works great!!  :)  I give it 5 stars!!!It works so well on my hair and I love the different heat settings.The price was perfect too!  So very happy!!,5
"This is by far the best hair straightener I have ever owned. I straighten my hair every day and nothing beats the quality of this one!Also they ship incredibly fast. We are military stationed over seas and most shipments take forever to get to an APO and this one was by far the fastest in under a week! I've waited months for items, so I was so excited!",5
This works so well! I have long wavy/curly hair and this straightens my hair quickly. Not to mention the price is great!,5
"This is hands down the best straightener out there! It heats up extremely fast and it doesn't take much time to have your hair straight. The glove, pouch and the argon oil are a plus. I am extremely happy and will definitely recommend to all my friends!",5
"This is hands down the greatest flat iron I've ever owned. You will not regret this purchase! Heats quickly, and is magical. Ive had it for two years now and it is still working. The only con is that I wish it had an auto shut off. If you leave it on in the morning, it will still be on when you get back from work.",5
Love this hair straightener.  Takes me maybe 3 minutes to straighten my hair and I just got a bad perm.  Highly recommended.,5
I really like this flat iron! It's heavy duty with adjustable temp & heats up quickly. Perfect for everyday use.,5
"I purchased this product recently and was quite nervous as I've never used it before. The anxiety was unfounded, this is by far the best straightening iron that I have every possessed. I strongly recommend it.",5
"Purchased for my wife for Christmas- She loves it- So, I do too. I am purchasing one for my mom this week.",5
This is the best flat iron I have ever used. It glides through my hair like silk. I am very happy with purchase. Thank you.,5
Seems a bit awkward to handle in that handle is wide.  There is no automatic off feature which in my opinionn is a necessary feature for most gals.i did not realize this when I purchased this particular item. On /Off control is in a less than ideal location.,3
"My hair is obnoxious to straighten usually.  This flat iron takes me no time to get it wicked straight.  It keeps my hair from feeling gross and dried out also.  Shiny straightness from a pretty awesome flat iron, can't ask for much else!",4
"TIP: reset the button on the electric plug before using. Mine didnt work at first.Leaves your hair shiny and soft. How does it do that??This is a great product. I used CHI hair straightener for the longest time until it recently died on me, but this is just as awesome!",5
Great flat iron just takes forever to heat up.  But very lightweight and doesn't make your hair frizzy. Definately reccomend it!,4
Bought for my wife. She loves it. She is African American with very nappy hair. Makes the style look thick instead of limp/thin. only problem Due to the location of the dial on the handle u can by accident turn it off while using.,4
"My daughter loves it!!!!! the last one she had stoped working, this new one is excelent ! works better than the one she had!!!!",5
Love this straightener! Does as good of a job if not better than a chi.  Great value for a great price.,5
Heats quickly! Long cord! Works fantastic even on medium heat which is much better for my hair than using the highest setting like my previous iron. Sleek design looks nice in the drawer too! Couldn't ask for a better value.My only wish is that it had an automatic shut off but I just had to train myself to unplug it and put in the drawer when I'm done.,4
"To me it works like any other regular iron hair straightener,I was hoping for an extra better result in my hair...",3
"A great buy for the price...haven't used it much but the times I did, it worked great!  I would recommend",4
"I was pleased with this product. I had compared prices in local stores and found this flat iron to be less costly than most. It is sturdy with a nice long cord and easily adjustable temperature setting. It's perfect when you want some style and sleekness but not a lot of curl. The Argon Oil was a nice added touch. I would recommend this flat iron, and the carrying case is great too.",5
...both of my daughters are always stealing it and leaving it in their rooms rather than using their own. sigh...,5
Broke after 2 months! Just stopped turning on. I am very sad to learn I cannot exchange this for a new one. I liked it but it just stopped working so now I need to buy another.,1
"I've been using this for awhile now. I'm pleased with this product. It straightens my very curly hair easily and more quickly than my previous flat iron. The only negative is the placement of the buttons. While they are away from the heating element, it's a bit awkward to have to put your fingers inside to turn on and off, or to regulate the temperature.That said, it is not reason enough not to purchase this item. My hair is smooth, so it does what it's intended to do.",4
"My daughter has really thick ""poofy"" hair as she calls it and she loves this straightener. She had one already and broke it so when we went to replace it I asked what kind she wanted this time (willing to pay more for one) and she chose this one again. She said it straightens her hair better than any straightener she's used and faster.",5
"I have owned 3 different ceramic flat irons over the past years.  I have very thick, fine, curly hair.  I like to go straight on a regular basis for several reasons besides I like the look as much as I do on a good curly day.  This flat iron works better than any of the other ones I have ever owned.  I can actually get it as flat and straight as the salon stylist can!  My oldest daughter has tight curls and I have straightened her hair a couple times now.  This is the first flat iron she is happy with.  It used to be, I would straighten her hair and by the time she returned home from school it was mostly curly again.  Not with the HSI flat iron.  She gets compliments and people are shocked at how beautifully straight it gets.  No fuzz or extra body.  I would recommend this to others for sure.",5
I've had it for a couple months now... Love it!!! Best flat iron I've had...  It does the job... Great price for a Great product...,5
"I just take this product with me anywhere i go. It just help me in a lot of situations mostly hair problems, well duh. Anyway, there are so handy and they heat up real quick so you want have any problem waiting if you are short in time.",5
Works how a flat iron should. Great product and will definitely be looking at HSI for future hair care products.,5
"I love this flat iron, it does its job well. I only gave it four stars because it catches the hair at times and that can be annoying.",4
It's amazing! I had a flat iron that I bought 10 years ago and it just wasn't really doing it's job anymore (can you blame it?!) so I decided to try this one and it exceeded all my expectations. It's pretty thin compared to my old one but it works 10 times better. Not only does my hair come out super straight but it stays straight which was a problem I had with the other one. I definitely recommend it!,5
"I am very pleased with my HSI flatiron. It is an excellent quality, and it works very well on my hair.",5
It is a very good flat iron. It straighten my curly frizzy hair into straight sleek hair. Highly recommend it.,5
"This straightener does a wonderful job leaving my hair very soft... I jus want to mention one thing, I did not have any trouble with the straightener's initial start up.. I plugged it on, turned the little switch to ON, and the plates got heated up within very few secs... it has been a month since I purchased this product n it works well for me. I did not have any problem in receiving the prod on the estimated date and the working condition of the straightener as well.. hence I m giving it 5 stars..,",5
I like to straighten my hair from time to time but it always left my hair dry and brittle. I am really pleased with HSI ceramic ionic flat iron because it does not damage my hair,5
Ive been using this everyday for a bout a year now. It works well and doesn't overheat my hair. The only weird thing about it is the light that goes from red to green that indicates when it's hot constantly switches back and forth at random times. I usually only look at the light to make sure my flat iron is plugged in and working. Heat concentration is nice and balanced. You can curl your hair with this straightener too.,4
"This is a great straightener that heats up quickly and does the job perfectly. Ive only had 2-3 straighteners before this one, but this one is by far the best one.",5
"I love it! It straightens my wavy hair perfectly! I've been using cheap hair straighteners, and I wish that I would have found this one earlier. It was a great price!",5
Took a chance on this one without hairdressers recommendation.Great price for a great productComes with a nice cover and so far is everything I hoped it would be.,5
"I needed a hair straightener to replace my Chi that I've had for 8 years. I have very curly hair but wear it straight every day, so I needed one that could work well and get a lot of use. I heard the new Chi straighteners were not as good as the original, so I decided to try a new brand. This one is just okay. It does the job, but my hair is not quite as smooth as it used to be. I will probably be trying another brand sometime soon and replacing this one.",3
"My first flat iron was a professional one for $200 and it was heavy with a wide plate.  This one is light and I bought it to travel with.  I travel with it.  I like it so much, I tossed my professional one and bought a second one for my home.",5
This was an amazing price and it works great. Bought it for my wife to use in France. Very happy with it.,5
It really works!!!!So happy that I purchased this flat iron.'s I am so in love with this product. It works wonders on hair!!!!!,4
"This product is very well made. It does a very good job at straightening my hair.  It came in a very timely manner. I would recommend this product because it is a professional iron at a very good price, much better than some other sites that I looked at.",5
Love this flat iron.  It's very well made.  Feels solid.  Like the fact that I can adjust the temperature.  Since I have fine hair I set the temp a little lower.  The only problem I have with it is if I get my hair a little too close to the end of the iron a hair or two will get snagged/caught somehow.  I've learned to keep my hair in the center portion of the iron plates..,5
I thought this was too good to be true. This is by far the best working straightener I have ever owned and I've had a million. It took me about 10 minutes to straighten my hair. I have medium length hair and it is super thick and curly. It worked so good. I am impressed by far. It also didn't cringe or burn my hair. The chi I have makes my hair burn and I can smell it (who wants to smell burnt hair?!) but this little beauty straightened and didn't burn! Better than a chi!,5
This is exactly what I needed for my coarse graying (colored) strands.. It has a little on/off switch that is hidden between the wand so that you don't accidentally turn it off while using it and that is where the temperature control button is also located. The temperature gauge goes up to 450. They give you a sample of Argan oil which is a product that I may purchase when I run out of the oil I bought from my salon. I love the glove that came with it because you can touch your hot hair as you style it. I'm so happy that I purchased this product!,5
The shipment was fast and the product is more than satisfactory. It comes as a set and it totally worth the price.,5
"I purchased this flat iron to replace an old one (different brand).  I love that it heats up so quickly and you can adjust the temperature.  That's a great feature since I use it on occasion on a lower setting to fix my daughter's ""sleep hair"" before school. The glove, pouch and oil were a nice bonus too!  Would definitely recommend this product!",5
"I gave my daughter one 2 yrs ago & it's great, so when my chi died I ordered my own.",5
"I bought this flat iron 2 years ago and I am still using it today. The tool works like it was my first time using it, I am so hooked to it that I cannot switch to another one, I tried to shop for one but I never end up buying any. It heats up really quickly and get the job done really really well. Personally, I do not set the temperature at its maximum and still get spaghetti hair result. I am thinking on getting their hair dryer too and whenever my flat iron will stop working I for sure get the newer version. Thank you",5
"I've now had this product for a couple of months and am very impressed.  I thought it was a great price for the package I got, and so far so good!",4
Very good straightener for a great price. I got it for my daughter and she loves how well it works for her.,5
"I really like this straighter, much better than my last one. It is odd that I have to reset it before it heats up. It doesn't make my hair feel dry or frizzed out.",4
"So far ..so good. Because I have an excellent hair stylist, I haven't had to use the flat iron much. BUT when I do, it's fine. It catches hair a bit and I don't like that, but otherwise it's great. I had a Chi prior to getting this one and loved my Chi. But after  reading so many great reviews about this flat iron, I figured I'd give it a go and I'm pleased and glad I did. It's a whole lot cheaper than the Chi also. I liked that most of all. Heat up quickly and nicely! Like the way it feels in the hand while straightening your hair. GREAT PRODUCT! Thinking about getting another one...just because.  Do wish it wouldn't snag your hair though. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.",4
"This is a fantastic straightener. The included HSI oil is so good too I purchased a bottle. I had my previous straightener I paid a lot more for burn out and decided to give this one a try. May I say this one seems to be of sounder-quality and comes with so many goodie freebies. I don't use the glove myself, but I think I just got used to not doing it that way. Comes in handy with curling though!",5
And the receiver has been extremely happy and satisfied with the product.  Easy to use.  Great results.  Nothing more to say.,5
This iron is definitely a great product. I have very thick and wavy hair and with this iron it takes me 30 min maximum to straighten my hair after using the hairdryer. I love the price too because I would never spend over *** on a hair styling product since I don't use it every day.,3
"I upgraded to the digital LCD temperature control model and this a flat iron someone could get excited about!It works (translation: my frizzy hair is straight!!!!), the price is unbeatable, there's no guessing about the temperature setting, the cord swivels (no small matter -- my Sedu stopped working because of an unresolvable twisted-cord problem) and if all of that weren't enough, the company that sold it to me was the most responsive and consumer sensitive company I've EVER dealt with.",5
ok let me start off by saying that my wife has blown through a million and a half hair straighteners and this one worked awesome shes got real thick long hair and this straightener heats up quick and gets the job done quick. Thank you HSI for saving me about another couple hundred bucks on straighteners. will it work you bet your butt it will,5
Our girls love it!. Easy to use and it is very fast. Very nice. You just need to take obvious safety precautions.,5
"One teeny complaint. The temperature dial is nearly impossible to get to, so changing settings while using the iron is not possible. So, I set it at about the halfway point and it's perfect - not so hot that I'm afraid of it, but hot enough to do it's job. I have a freakishly thick head of hair (so my stylist says) and if I don't get it straightened fully, it gets springy and wavy. This iron is very comfortable and easy to use. I highly recommend it!",5
"If you have thick hair I would recommend something wider than 1"".  Straightener works well, but takes a long time if you have a lot of hair",4
This straightener is made very well.  Durable.  Does a great job!I actually received this package on a Sunday.  I was very pleased & surprised!,5
"i love this flat iron, its quality is professional and the results are high end def buy! last flat iron ill ever buy.",5
"As this was bought as a gift, I don't have first hand use knowledge with it. My daughter has been happy with it. Her hair looks great :) and there were no issues with packaging or shipping. Thanks!",4
"This is my first flat iron and I am loving it.  I held off on getting one because I have fairly straight, fine hair and was always concerned about damaging it.  But the temperature control on this is easy and reassuring.  The iron heats up completely in the time it takes me to blow dry my shoulder-length hair and works perfectly.  It also comes with a sample packet of their argan oil and coupon for additional supply (which truly helps to protect your hair, especially for fine hair; however you can generally use any drugstore anti-frizz or conditioning product which work just as well.)The biggest selling point for me was the fantastic value.  You won't find a better flat iron at a better price!",5
"I overheard my wife talking about how bad her straight iron was, so I surprised her with this based on other users feedback. She loves it. She says it heats up really quickly, the cord doesn't get tangled, and even comes with a storage sleeve to keep it in. Great value for the price compared to CHI or others.",5
"Works great, heats up fast, does the job.  No complaints.  Very nice packaging and seems super high quality. Works great to curl as well",5
"After reading the reviews I thought this would be a better flat.  It pulls my hair, and you have to put a lot of pressure on it to get the inside of the plates to meet. And it doesnt work nearly as great as my old cortex, its very hot, which would be good except I have to go over my hair multiple time and I have thin wavy hair.",3
"I paid more than double for a Chi and this straightener works twice as good as that one. My hair is extremely thick and curly, too, so I have a hard time finding a good flat iron. I don't think any brand will ever be a ""one pass straightener"" for my hair, but this is as good as it gets IMO.",5
"Sorry for the late review.  I ordered this during summer break, but did not start using it for a few months.  I wanted to use it for a while before giving an honest review.  I have thick, straight hair, that just needs a little help in the morning.  This iron does not even provide enough heat to straighten a few morning waves.  I have the temperature knob turned all the way up, and I still have to pass it through the same place 4-6 times to acheive a smoothe look.  I gave two stars because it does glide without pulling.  I really wanted to believe the reviews, and hoped that this one would do the job.  Unfortunately, this one isn't for me :(",2
This is a really good flat iron for the price.  It does the job quickly and perfectly.  The iron heats up super fast and I love that it comes with a special glove to protect your hand while you use it.  I highly recommend it!!,5
"You honestly get what you paid for. No doubt about it, this machine will snag your hair. I would just fork out extra money to buy a better hair straightener but if you need one that does a mediocre job then go with this one.",3
"Love love love.What more can I say. Heats up quickly, does the job well with ease, mind you I live on the north east coast of South America. Humidity here is every women's enemy. I did have a Keratine blowout done but still amazing results. Also got the bigger argan bottle from HSI. Don't care too much for the smell of it. Seriously I really don't care because my hair looks shiny, healthy and feels really soft. Just buy it already",5
"planning to get the Chi since I had one previously and thought it was the best; however, after reading reviews I decided to try it since it was half the price and it has been a great product.",5
"Daughter absolutely love these, she asked for a Chi after reading reviews on this one and price I gave this one a try, and I am glad I did.",5
"Works great, doesn't dry out my hair!  Love it!  Would recommend it to anyone who wants to straighten their hair!",5
"I have a bad and cheap one before, it takes forward to finish the job.Often I gave up before I get it all done.so when I got this one, I am happy.",5
"Heats up very quickly and does an excellent job. It is hot though so be careful, gf already burned herself once.",5
"I feel I am always buying new hair straighteners from the drug store or a Big Box store after one or two years because they break so easily and are not that high quality. I decided to invest in a higher-quality product and was pleased with the HSI Professional. I have not had any problems with the straightener and I loved the packaging. It came with a glove, a silk storage pouch and a sample of Argan oil. Great product. It was delivered speedily as well.",5
This straightener works really great.It works great. It's good. It is nice. It is good. Good for your hail,4
"This flat iron met all my expectations, I love it, I love that I can curl my hair with it. I would recommend this flat iron.",5
