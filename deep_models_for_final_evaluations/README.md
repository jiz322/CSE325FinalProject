# Commonalities
There are models we used for final evaluation. Each ipynb file has a confusion matrix inside. The abusolution distance and diagonal values are computed.

# Balanced Models
For all 6 balanced models, the "amazon_review_less_than_300_chars_balanced.csv" is used. \
All of these deep models (also include naive bayes) are having exactly the same training and test set (we set the same seed before shuffling).  The training set has 400000 entries, and the test set has 100000 entries.\

# Unbalanced Model (for May5th_BERT only)
It is trained with balanced model, but tested on unbalanced one. \

# Model Includes Error Analysis
Only for the BERT_unbalanced_test
